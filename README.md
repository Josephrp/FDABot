# project-template

hey there folks, designed this project template to go quicker when making llamaindex application logic.

basically the idea is to put all the configurations and settings logic in the config folder, all the agents and llms in the engine folder and the various memories, tools and codexecution environments separate. filling these out always makes a pretty cool agent ;-)
