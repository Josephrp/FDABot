(EHSI) was ordered today to pay $1.086 billion in criminal fines and an additional $450 million in criminal forfeiture \u2014 the second-largest set of criminal financial penalties ever levied against a pharmaceutical company \u2014for violations of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act related to the distribution of the opioid medication Opana ER with INTAC (Opana ER).EHSI pleaded guilty on April 18 to one misdemeanor count of introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce. In pleading guilty, EHSI admitted that from April 2012 through May 2013, certain EHSI sales representatives marketed Opana ER to prescribers by touting the drug\u2019s purported abuse deterrence, tamper resistance and/or crush resistance, despite a lack of clinical data supporting those claims.EHSI\u2019s corporate affiliates emerged from bankruptcy on April 23. EHSI will cease to operate in its current form and will not emerge from bankruptcy. Payment of the criminal fine imposed at sentencing is addressed as a component of the broader resolution resolving all monetary claims held by the United States against the corporate entities. In addition, as part of the confirmed bankruptcy plan, the new company has funded voluntary trusts in settlement of opioid-relating claims, including public trusts that will pay over $450 million to state, municipal and Tribal entities to help fund programs to abate the opioid crisis. The department is crediting up to $450 million of such payments against the agreed forfeiture amount. The EHSI affiliates that have emerged from bankruptcy are subject to an injunction restraining future opioid sales and marketing and requiring the publication of millions of documents relating to its role in the opioid crisis.\u201cThe opioid epidemic has caused substantial harm to the American people, and the companies whose unlawful tactics contributed to it must be held accountable,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division. \u201cEHSI\u2019s criminal guilty plea, and the sentence imposed upon it, further emphasizes the department\u2019s commitment to prosecuting companies whose illegal conduct contributed to the opioid crisis.\u201d\u201cThe opioid crisis we continue to face today originated, in part, from companies like EHSI building their business on false claims and deceptive business practices,\u201d said DEA Administrator Anne Milgram. \u201cBy intentionally misrepresenting opioid medications, EHSI prioritized profits over the health and well-being of the American people. Today\u2019s settlement reflects DEA\u2019s commitment to keep Americans safe and holding companies like EHSI accountable.\u201d\u201cThe sentencing in this case demonstrates the level of commitment FDA shares with our Department of Justice colleagues to address the opioid overdose crisis in the United States,\u201d said Associate Commissioner Michael Rogers of FDA\u2019s Office of Regulatory Affairs. \u201cENDO Health Solutions did not provide accurate information about the safety and abuse potential of their product, putting patients at additional risk of abuse and addiction. Such conduct undermines the agency\u2019s public health mission and will not be tolerated.

The Candy Shop stores sold CBD and vape products.In 2020, the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics and Drug Enforcement Administration began investigating the Candy Shop. The investigation revealed that some of the vape products sold by the Candy Shops in Mississippi contained Schedule I controlled substances and controlled substance analogues. In 2022, the DEA also received complaints that some of the products at the Candy Shops were making customers ill.Agents obtained search warrants for the Candy Shops located in Mississippi and North Carolina. They also obtained a warrant for Deming\u2019s residence.\u00a0 The warrants were contemporaneously executed on January 26, 2023. During the execution of the search warrants, law enforcement officers seized over $1.8 million in cash from Deming\u2019s residence and additional cash and controlled substances from his stores.As the investigation continued, agents learned that Deming was aware that his vape additives did not contain CBD; rather, they contained synthetic cannabinoids. This was evidenced by group chats in which Deming\u2019s employees complained about how the additives were too strong and could hurt their customers. Despite this fact, Deming misbranded the additives as containing CBD.In addition, through the course of the investigation, agents were able to determine that in May of 2022, Deming sent an uncharged coconspirator $2,200.00 to purchase 1 kilogram of 5F-AB-PINACA, a Schedule I controlled substance, for use in the Candy Shop\u2019s vape additives and that, at the time Deming sent the money, he knew that 5F-AB-PINACA was a controlled substance.The Government\u2019s investigation also revealed that Deming\u2019s gross sales of vape additive products containing either Schedule I controlled substances or their analogues totaled over $2 million.Deming was indicted by a federal grand jury on September 19, 2023.\u201cA public official\u2019s side job should not be running a business that distributes millions of dollars in illegal controlled substances and endangers the health and safety of its customers,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Todd Gee. \u201cWe appreciate the hard work of investigators with the DEA, FDA, and MBN to put a stop to the distribution of these dangerous vape additives.\u201d\"The DEA is committed to holding all individuals accountable for drug trafficking, regardless of position,\u201d said DEA Assistant Special Agent in Charge Anessa Daniels-McCaw. \u201cMr. Deming's guilty plea is a reminder that no one is above the law.

Bateman had been extradited from the United Kingdom to face charges. Chief Judge Geoffrey W. Crawford sentenced Bateman, who has spent approximately 20 months in custody, to a sentence of time-served, with no supervision to follow, as the defendant is expected to be deported to the United Kingdom upon the completion of his sentence.Previously sentenced in connection with this case were Bateman\u2019s co-conspirators, Samir Doshi and Rebecca Buckley. In February 2019, following his guilty pleas to conspiracy to distribute Schedule IV controlled substances and violating the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, United States District Judge Christina Reiss sentenced Doshi to time served after Doshi had served about six months in jail. He also was ordered to forfeit $20,000. In September 2020, following her guilty plea to conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, Judge Reiss sentenced Buckley to five years of probation and forfeiture of $349,712.10.According to court records, between in or about 2015 and in or about August 2019, Paul Bateman worked with others, including Buckley and Doshi, to distribute controlled substances and other prescription drugs over the internet. Bateman was a search engine optimizer (\u201cSEO\u201d) responsible for creating and maintaining websites that offered controlled substances and other drugs for sale. Bateman also took steps to improve the ranking of his websites in response to customer searches. The websites created by Bateman did not ask for or require a prescription prior to the distribution of controlled substances and other drugs.In or about 2015, Bateman began working with Buckley, who provided customer service and credit card processing for customer orders made through Bateman\u2019s websites. After customers paid Buckley, Buckley sent some of the proceeds to Bateman, typically via wire transfer. Bateman used some of this money to pay suppliers and others while keeping some for himself. The websites that Bateman and Buckley operated sold drugs such as Modafinil, a wakefulness-promoting drug that is a Schedule IV controlled substance, and prescription medications for erectile dysfunction.Bateman also worked with Samir Doshi. In or about 2016 or 2017, Bateman and Doshi met in Thailand and discussed a business relationship in which Bateman would build websites for Doshi for the sale of Schedule IV controlled substances Tramadol (an opiate pain reliever) and Soma (also known as, Carisoprodol, a muscle relaxant). Doshi provided Bateman with $2,000 to build those websites. After that meeting, Bateman created websites for the sale of Tramadol and Soma. Bateman also received commission payments from Doshi. In or about May 2018, Bateman and Doshi began marketing Tapentadol to customers, including by drafting and sending an email introducing Tapentadol as a product for sale. Tapentadol is an opiate classified as a Schedule II controlled substance.This investigation was led by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations. The Department of Justice\u2019s Office of International Affairs and the United States Marshals Service substantially assisted with Bateman\u2019s extradition from the United Kingdom to the United States.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3732, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33d28a7b-f42e-4266-b9d9-447865ce0f79": {"__data__": {"id_": "33d28a7b-f42e-4266-b9d9-447865ce0f79", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"url": "https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/press-releases/three-sentenced-international-controlled-substances-and-prescription-drug-trafficking-operation"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5792721f-8170-463c-8a83-f53c3f9305c6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/press-releases/three-sentenced-international-controlled-substances-and-prescription-drug-trafficking-operation"}, "hash": "6bdf7dc3a268fe663d35a9363e466e639097f1b753322f9a567c3b453bf5225e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ec9a110c-fd1a-4972-9718-46ac2543ec94", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/press-releases/three-sentenced-international-controlled-substances-and-prescription-drug-trafficking-operation"}, "hash": "20f5bad9b2e23ed78b343fbf40d472c23b4a1fe470d816b34ff1087f10f8f58e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "United States Attorney Nikolas P.

About one month after the unexplained emergencies began, an anesthesiologist who had worked at the facility earlier that day died while treating herself for dehydration using an IV bag. In August 2022, doctors at the surgical care center began to suspect tainted IV bags had caused the repeated crises after an 18-year-old patient had to be rushed to the intensive care unit in critical condition during a routine sinus surgery.A local lab analyzed fluid from the bag used during the teenager\u2019s surgery and found bupivacaine (a nerve-blocking agent), epinephrine (a stimulant) and lidocaine (an anesthetic) \u2014 a drug cocktail that could have caused the boy\u2019s symptoms, which included very high blood pressure, cardiac dysfunction and pulmonary edema. The lab also observed a puncture in the bag.Ortiz surreptitiously injected IV bags of saline with epinephrine, bupivacaine and other drugs, placed them into a warming bin at the facility, and waited for them to be used in colleagues\u2019 surgeries, knowing their patients would experience dangerous complications. Surveillance video introduced into evidence showed Ortiz repeatedly retrieving IV bags from the warming bin and replacing them shortly thereafter, not long before the bags were carried into operating rooms where patients experienced complications.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3589, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a97037e-3d96-40b0-ae49-63e69f420286": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a97037e-3d96-40b0-ae49-63e69f420286", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"url": "https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/press-releases/dallas-anesthesiologist-convicted-tampering-iv-bags-linked-cardiac-emergencies-during-routine"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ae12d73-b286-41aa-a43d-7ce442429143", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/press-releases/dallas-anesthesiologist-convicted-tampering-iv-bags-linked-cardiac-emergencies-during-routine"}, "hash": "23a18c8ca6db7d35eeb0a82721a8227973c514227dcd99ff6dce2f8e55fc1705", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "da61560a-1a6d-4915-b186-d7bff72a9334", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/press-releases/dallas-anesthesiologist-convicted-tampering-iv-bags-linked-cardiac-emergencies-during-routine"}, "hash": "37fe8449d3a9c168075d761f280c9278782d0ee3a16f59ded563a3b30e275634", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Video also showed Ortiz mixing vials of medication and watching as victims were wheeled out by emergency responders.Evidence presented at trial showed that Ortiz was facing disciplinary action at the time for an alleged medical mistake made in his one of his own surgeries, and that he potentially faced losing his medical license.At trial, doctors testified about the confusion they felt when their patients\u2019 blood pressures suddenly skyrocketed.
