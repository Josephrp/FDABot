        "content": "Department of JusticeUS Attorney's OfficeOffice of Public AffairsFor Immediate ReleaseFriday, May 3, 2024Endo Health Solutions Inc. (EHSI) was ordered today to pay $1.086 billion in criminal fines and an additional $450 million in criminal forfeiture — the second-largest set of criminal financial penalties ever levied against a pharmaceutical company —for violations of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act related to the distribution of the opioid medication Opana ER with INTAC (Opana ER).EHSI pleaded guilty on April 18 to one misdemeanor count of introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce. In pleading guilty, EHSI admitted that from April 2012 through May 2013, certain EHSI sales representatives marketed Opana ER to prescribers by touting the drug’s purported abuse deterrence, tamper resistance and/or crush resistance, despite a lack of clinical data supporting those claims.EHSI’s corporate affiliates emerged from bankruptcy on April 23. EHSI will cease to operate in its current form and will not emerge from bankruptcy. Payment of the criminal fine imposed at sentencing is addressed as a component of the broader resolution resolving all monetary claims held by the United States against the corporate entities. In addition, as part of the confirmed bankruptcy plan, the new company has funded voluntary trusts in settlement of opioid-relating claims, including public trusts that will pay over $450 million to state, municipal and Tribal entities to help fund programs to abate the opioid crisis. The department is crediting up to $450 million of such payments against the agreed forfeiture amount. The EHSI affiliates that have emerged from bankruptcy are subject to an injunction restraining future opioid sales and marketing and requiring the publication of millions of documents relating to its role in the opioid crisis.“The opioid epidemic has caused substantial harm to the American people, and the companies whose unlawful tactics contributed to it must be held accountable,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “EHSI’s criminal guilty plea, and the sentence imposed upon it, further emphasizes the department’s commitment to prosecuting companies whose illegal conduct contributed to the opioid crisis.”“The opioid crisis we continue to face today originated, in part, from companies like EHSI building their business on false claims and deceptive business practices,” said DEA Administrator Anne Milgram. “By intentionally misrepresenting opioid medications, EHSI prioritized profits over the health and well-being of the American people. Today’s settlement reflects DEA’s commitment to keep Americans safe and holding companies like EHSI accountable.”“The sentencing in this case demonstrates the level of commitment FDA shares with our Department of Justice colleagues to address the opioid overdose crisis in the United States,” said Associate Commissioner Michael Rogers of FDA’s Office of Regulatory Affairs. “ENDO Health Solutions did not provide accurate information about the safety and abuse potential of their product, putting patients at additional risk of abuse and addiction. Such conduct undermines the agency’s public health mission and will not be tolerated. We will aggressively pursue and bring to justice those who knowingly endanger the nation’s public health.”“The opioid epidemic is a plague on our country,” said Inspector General Robert P. Storch for the Department of Defense (DoD). “Our warfighters and their families sacrifice greatly for us, and we owe them a quality healthcare system free from corrupt corporate practices such as the ones perpetrated by this company. I applaud the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the Department of Justice and the investigative team from the DoD OIG’s Defense Criminal Investigative Service for their tenacious pursuit of justice in this case. This settlement sends a clear message to companies who place profits above the health and welfare of our warfighters, their families, and our retirees.”“Today’s sentencing holds the defendants accountable for their role in the long-term deceptive practice of making false statements related to the safety of the opioids they were marketing,” said Inspector General Michael J. Missal for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). “The VA Office of Inspector General thanks the Department of Justice and our law enforcement partners for their efforts in this joint investigation.”“The successful resolution of this case is a testament to the professionalism and teamwork displayed by our agents, our fellow investigative agencies, and the U.S. Department of Justice,” said Inspector General Kevin H. Winters for Amtrak. “We remain committed to protecting Amtrak employees, retirees, and their families by investigating any acts that could put them at risk, such as the misbranding of potentially dangerous drugs.”“Through extensive false advertising efforts to conceal oxymorphone’s deleterious effects, Endo Health Solutions Inc. EHSI demonstrated a callous disregard for the safety and well-being of the people who were prescribed this highly addictive drug,” said Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey B. Veltri of the FBI Miami Field Office. “But thanks to the hard work of our partners including the Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, the Veteran’s Administration Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Office of the Inspector General, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and the Amtrak Office of Inspector General, we are holding EHSI responsible for their significant contribution to the opioid epidemic.”“Putting people first is at the core of our mission and our agency will continue to be relentless in investigating companies that endanger people in order to boost profits through aggressive, unlawful marketing and misbranding of products,” said Christi A. Grimm of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “Working closely with our partners across several agencies, HHS-OIG remains committed to protecting federal health care programs and the health and safety of people served by those programs.”In pleading guilty, EHSI admitted that certain sales managers were aware that the sales representatives were making claims of purported abuse deterrence, tamper resistance and/or crush resistance when marketing Opana ER to prescribers, and that certain sales representatives were striking non-medicated sample pills with hammers and conducting other demonstrations to convey the message that Opana ER was, in fact, crush proof and tamper resistant. The approved labeling for Opana ER did not provide adequate information for healthcare providers to safely prescribe Opana ER for use as an opioid that is abuse deterrent. According to the plea agreement, EHSI was responsible for the misbranding of Opana ER by marketing the drug with a label that failed to include adequate directions for its claimed abuse deterrence use, in violation of the FDCA.EHSI withdrew Opana ER from the market in 2017.The FBI, DEA, HHS-OIG, FDA-OCI, VA-OIG, OPM-OIG, DCIS and the Amtrak Office of Inspector General conducted the criminal investigation.Assistant Director Gabriel H. Scannapieco and Trial Attorneys Ben Cornfeld, Brant Cook, Tara M. Shinnick and Colin Trundle of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch prosecuted the case.For more information about the Consumer Protection Branch and its enforcement efforts visitwww.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch.Tips and complaints from all sources about potential fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement can be reported to HHS, at 1-800-HHS-TIPS (800-447-8477).###"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney's OfficeSouthern District of MississippiFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, May 2, 2024Gulfport, Mississippi – A Biloxi City Councilman pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a Schedule I controlled substance.Robert Leon Deming, III, 47, pled guilty in U.S. District Court in Gulfport.According to court documents and information presented to the court, in 2019, Deming founded the Candy Shop, LLC to operate Candy Shop stores in Mississippi and North Carolina. The Candy Shop stores sold CBD and vape products.In 2020, the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics and Drug Enforcement Administration began investigating the Candy Shop. The investigation revealed that some of the vape products sold by the Candy Shops in Mississippi contained Schedule I controlled substances and controlled substance analogues. In 2022, the DEA also received complaints that some of the products at the Candy Shops were making customers ill.Agents obtained search warrants for the Candy Shops located in Mississippi and North Carolina. They also obtained a warrant for Deming’s residence.  The warrants were contemporaneously executed on January 26, 2023. During the execution of the search warrants, law enforcement officers seized over $1.8 million in cash from Deming’s residence and additional cash and controlled substances from his stores.As the investigation continued, agents learned that Deming was aware that his vape additives did not contain CBD; rather, they contained synthetic cannabinoids. This was evidenced by group chats in which Deming’s employees complained about how the additives were too strong and could hurt their customers. Despite this fact, Deming misbranded the additives as containing CBD.In addition, through the course of the investigation, agents were able to determine that in May of 2022, Deming sent an uncharged coconspirator $2,200.00 to purchase 1 kilogram of 5F-AB-PINACA, a Schedule I controlled substance, for use in the Candy Shop’s vape additives and that, at the time Deming sent the money, he knew that 5F-AB-PINACA was a controlled substance.The Government’s investigation also revealed that Deming’s gross sales of vape additive products containing either Schedule I controlled substances or their analogues totaled over $2 million.Deming was indicted by a federal grand jury on September 19, 2023.“A public official’s side job should not be running a business that distributes millions of dollars in illegal controlled substances and endangers the health and safety of its customers,” said U.S. Attorney Todd Gee. “We appreciate the hard work of investigators with the DEA, FDA, and MBN to put a stop to the distribution of these dangerous vape additives.”\"The DEA is committed to holding all individuals accountable for drug trafficking, regardless of position,” said DEA Assistant Special Agent in Charge Anessa Daniels-McCaw. “Mr. Deming's guilty plea is a reminder that no one is above the law. We will continue to work with our state and local partners to investigate and prosecute those who violate the Controlled Substances Act.\"“U.S. consumers are put at risk when labeling is false and misleading,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin Fielder, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Miami Field Office. “Labeling is designed to provide information that can help consumers make informed choices about what they purchase and consume. The FDA is committed to pursuing and bringing to justice those who unlawfully mask controlled substances as known consumer products to be sold to the American public.”As part of the plea agreement in this case, Deming agreed to forfeit a yellow Monster Truck with oversized tires and a lift kit and over $1.9 million dollars. His sentencing is scheduled for August 13, 2024.U.S. Attorney Todd W. Gee, Assistant Special Agent in Charge Anessa Daniels McCaw of the Drug Enforcement Administration and Special Agent in Charge Justin Fielder of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations Miami Field Office made the announcement.The case was investigated by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations and the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics.The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Jonathan Buckner and Lee Smith.###"

McMillan, the Special Agent in Charge of the New York Field Office of the Office of Criminal Investigations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), announced the unsealing of a criminal Complaint in Manhattan federal court charging ISIS NAVARRO REYES, a/k/a “Beraly Navarro,” with receipt of misbranded drugs in interstate commerce, dispensing misbranded drugs while held for sale, conspiracy to introduce and deliver for introduction misbranded drugs in interstate commerce, dispensing of misbranded drugs while held for sale, and smuggling.  As alleged in the Complaint, from about November 2022 through about January 2024, REYES marketed, advertised, and sold various misbranded and adulterated weight loss drugs, including Ozempic, Mesofrance, and Axcion, to followers on social media.  REYES, who is not licensed by law to administer prescription medication, obtained the weight loss drugs that she held for sale from Central and South America.  None of the weight loss drugs that REYES sold were approved for sale or dispensing in the United States by the FDA.  REYES was arrested this morning and will be presented in Manhattan federal court later today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Moses.U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “As alleged, Isis Navarro Reyes used her social media following to sell weight loss drugs unapproved for distribution in the United States.  Reyes’s alleged unlawful dispensing of these drugs caused significant, life-threatening injuries to some victims and put all of her victims in harm’s way.  Recently, public interest in semaglutide and weight loss drugs has skyrocketed, and criminals have sought to take advantage of this interest for their ends.  With this, the first misbranding and adulteration charges brought pertaining to semaglutide, Reyes will be held accountable for her conduct, and criminals should think twice before trying to sell weight loss drugs without a license to do so.  This case makes clear that extreme caution and physician consultation should always be taken when purchasing medications, especially on social media.”FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Special Agent in Charge Fernando P. McMillan said: “Selling misbranded prescription drugs, particularly injectable products that should be sterile, in the U.S. marketplace puts all consumers’ health at risk.  We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who jeopardize the public’s health by selling misbranded drugs.”As alleged in the Complaint:1From about November 2022 through about November 2023, ISIS NAVARRO REYES, using TikTok, posted dozens of videos about weight loss drugs including, but not limited to, Ozempic, Axcion, and Mesotherapy.In her videos, REYES showcases the weight loss drugs, instructs viewers how frequently they should be used, describes how they should be taken or injected, and claims to describe her personal experiences — for example, side effects and effectiveness in causing weight loss — in detail.  In several of these videos, REYES tells viewers that they can contact her via an encrypted messaging application on her cellphone (the “Cellphone”) if they would like to order the weight loss drugs that she is selling.On about October 11, 2023, REYES posted a video pertaining to Ozempic.  In this video, REYES demonstrates how to inject oneself with the medication and shares her experience using the drug.  Toward the end of the video, REYES instructs viewers to contact her on the Cellphone if they are interested in having her obtain Ozempic for them.  A screenshot from this TikTok post is below:In about December 2023, a law enforcement officer acting in an undercover capacity (the “UC”) began messaging REYES on the Cellphone.  From about December 2023 through about January 2024, the UC and REYES exchanged several messages concerning REYES’s supply of Ozempic and the UC’s interest in purchasing Ozempic from REYES.  On about January 7, 2024, pursuant to instructions from REYES, the UC sent $375 to a Zelle account in the name of “Isis Reyes Navarro.”  REYES did not ask the UC to provide a prescription, and the UC did not provide one.  On about January 9, 2024, REYES dropped off a package intended for the UC at a post office located in or around Shirley, New York.On about January 12, 2024, law enforcement received a package addressed to the UC from REYES (the “UC Parcel”) in Manhattan.  The UC Parcel contained a box containing what purported to be Ozempic.2Photos of packaging containing the purported Ozempic that REYES mailed the UC are below:All of the labeling accompanying the Ozempic in the UC Parcel was in Spanish, in violation of FDA regulations.In about November 2022, a woman who had viewed content posted to REYES’s TikTok account (“Victim-1”) called the Cellphone for the purpose of ordering weight loss drugs.  The individual who answered Victim‑1’s call identified herself as “Isis Navarro Reyes.”  In about February 2023, Victim-1 purchased 30 injections of Mesofrance, an injectable weight loss drug, from REYES.  REYES mailed the Mesofrance to Victim-1’s residence in White Plains, New York.  REYES did not ask Victim-1 to provide a prescription, and Victim-1 did not provide one.Between about February 2023 and about June 2023, Victim-1 self-administered 28 injections.  In an audio message that she recorded and transmitted, REYES provided Victim-1 with instructions on how to administer the drug.  REYES told Victim-1, among other things, to inject herself every three days.  All of the labeling of the vials that contained the Mesofrance that Victim‑1 purchased from REYES were in a language other than English, in violation of FDA regulations.On about July 13, 2023, Victim-1 began developing lesions from administering the Mesofrance.  Victim-1 sent messages to REYES about her injuries and sent photos.  In about October 2023, Victim-1’s physician diagnosed her with a mycobacterium abscessus infection, which is frequently caused by the contamination of medications, medical products, and medical devices with the mycobacterium abscessus bacterium.  In about November 2023, the New York Department of Health tested one of the vials of Mesofrance that Victim-1 purchased from REYES.  The substance tested positive for mycobacterium abscessus, a species of rapidly growing, multidrug-resistant, nontuberculous mycobacteria.*                *                *REYES, 36, of Shirley, New York, is charged with one count of smuggling, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison;

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney's OfficeDistrict of VermontFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, April 19, 2024Burlington, Vermont – The United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Vermont announced that on April 19, 2024, Paul Bateman, 47, a citizen of the United Kingdom who previously resided in Laos, was sentenced in the United States District Court following his guilty plea to conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, including the opiates Tapentadol and Tramadol, as well as other drugs that required a prescription. Bateman had been extradited from the United Kingdom to face charges. Chief Judge Geoffrey W. Crawford sentenced Bateman, who has spent approximately 20 months in custody, to a sentence of time-served, with no supervision to follow, as the defendant is expected to be deported to the United Kingdom upon the completion of his sentence.Previously sentenced in connection with this case were Bateman’s co-conspirators, Samir Doshi and Rebecca Buckley. In February 2019, following his guilty pleas to conspiracy to distribute Schedule IV controlled substances and violating the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, United States District Judge Christina Reiss sentenced Doshi to time served after Doshi had served about six months in jail. He also was ordered to forfeit $20,000. In September 2020, following her guilty plea to conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, Judge Reiss sentenced Buckley to five years of probation and forfeiture of $349,712.10.According to court records, between in or about 2015 and in or about August 2019, Paul Bateman worked with others, including Buckley and Doshi, to distribute controlled substances and other prescription drugs over the internet. Bateman was a search engine optimizer (“SEO”) responsible for creating and maintaining websites that offered controlled substances and other drugs for sale. Bateman also took steps to improve the ranking of his websites in response to customer searches. The websites created by Bateman did not ask for or require a prescription prior to the distribution of controlled substances and other drugs.In or about 2015, Bateman began working with Buckley, who provided customer service and credit card processing for customer orders made through Bateman’s websites. After customers paid Buckley, Buckley sent some of the proceeds to Bateman, typically via wire transfer. Bateman used some of this money to pay suppliers and others while keeping some for himself. The websites that Bateman and Buckley operated sold drugs such as Modafinil, a wakefulness-promoting drug that is a Schedule IV controlled substance, and prescription medications for erectile dysfunction.Bateman also worked with Samir Doshi. In or about 2016 or 2017, Bateman and Doshi met in Thailand and discussed a business relationship in which Bateman would build websites for Doshi for the sale of Schedule IV controlled substances Tramadol (an opiate pain reliever) and Soma (also known as, Carisoprodol, a muscle relaxant). Doshi provided Bateman with $2,000 to build those websites. After that meeting, Bateman created websites for the sale of Tramadol and Soma. Bateman also received commission payments from Doshi. In or about May 2018, Bateman and Doshi began marketing Tapentadol to customers, including by drafting and sending an email introducing Tapentadol as a product for sale. Tapentadol is an opiate classified as a Schedule II controlled substance.This investigation was led by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations. The Department of Justice’s Office of International Affairs and the United States Marshals Service substantially assisted with Bateman’s extradition from the United Kingdom to the United States. United States Attorney Nikolas P. Kerest commended the efforts of law enforcement and stated, “From behind their computer screens, Bateman and his co-conspirators were responsible for distributing dangerous opiates and unregulated, prescription drugs to consumers throughout the United States and across the globe for profit. Some consumers were located in Vermont, and none of the defendants were licensed to prescribe in Vermont. This case demonstrates law enforcement’s commitment to halting this conduct and bringing those responsible to justice, even when they are located abroad.”“Prescription drugs that are smuggled from overseas and are outside the secure supply chain can present a serious health risk to those who use them. The drugs may contain unknown or dangerous ingredients and are manufactured under unknown or unregulated conditions,” said Special Agent in Charge Fernando P. McMillan, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations New York Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who traffic in illegal prescription drugs.”Bateman was represented by Assistant Federal Public Defender Steven L. Barth. Doshi was represented by Mark A. Kaplan, Esq. Buckley was represented by Matthew Hart, Esq. Assistant U. S. Attorneys Andrew C. Gilman and John J.

        "content": "Department of JusticeOffice of Public AffairsFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, April 12, 2024A Dallas anesthesiologist was convicted today for injecting dangerous drugs into patient IV bags, leading to one death and numerous cardiac emergencies, the Justice Department announced.Raynaldo Riviera Ortiz Jr., 60, was charged by criminal complaint in September 2023 and indicted the following month on charges related to tampering with IV bags used at a local surgical center. After eight days of trial and seven hours of deliberation, a jury convicted him of four counts of tampering with consumer products resulting in serious bodily injury, one count of tampering with a consumer product and five counts of intentional adulteration of a drug.“The facts brought out at trial in this case are particularly disturbing,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The department will work with its law enforcement partners to hold accountable anyone who puts patients’ lives at risk by tampering with critical medical products.”“Dr. Ortiz cloaked himself in the white coat of a healer, but instead of curing pain, he inflicted it,” said U.S. Attorney Leigha Simonton for the Northern District of Texas. “He assembled ticking time bombs, then sat in wait as those medical time bombs went off one by one, toxic cocktails flowing into the veins of patients who were often at their most vulnerable, lying unconscious on the operating table. We saw the patients testify. Their pain, their fear and their trauma was palpable in that courtroom.”“Patients expect that their doctors will use only safe and effective medical products during their surgeries. When illicit tampering occurs, serious harm and even death can result,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L. Grinstead of the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OIC). “Working with our law enforcement partners, we will continue to monitor, investigate and bring to justice those who would risk patients’ health and safety.”According to evidence presented at trial, between May and August 2022, numerous patients at Surgicare North Dallas suffered cardiac emergencies during routine medical procedures performed by various doctors. About one month after the unexplained emergencies began, an anesthesiologist who had worked at the facility earlier that day died while treating herself for dehydration using an IV bag. In August 2022, doctors at the surgical care center began to suspect tainted IV bags had caused the repeated crises after an 18-year-old patient had to be rushed to the intensive care unit in critical condition during a routine sinus surgery.A local lab analyzed fluid from the bag used during the teenager’s surgery and found bupivacaine (a nerve-blocking agent), epinephrine (a stimulant) and lidocaine (an anesthetic) — a drug cocktail that could have caused the boy’s symptoms, which included very high blood pressure, cardiac dysfunction and pulmonary edema. The lab also observed a puncture in the bag.Ortiz surreptitiously injected IV bags of saline with epinephrine, bupivacaine and other drugs, placed them into a warming bin at the facility, and waited for them to be used in colleagues’ surgeries, knowing their patients would experience dangerous complications. Surveillance video introduced into evidence showed Ortiz repeatedly retrieving IV bags from the warming bin and replacing them shortly thereafter, not long before the bags were carried into operating rooms where patients experienced complications. Video also showed Ortiz mixing vials of medication and watching as victims were wheeled out by emergency responders.Evidence presented at trial showed that Ortiz was facing disciplinary action at the time for an alleged medical mistake made in his one of his own surgeries, and that he potentially faced losing his medical license.At trial, doctors testified about the confusion they felt when their patients’ blood pressures suddenly skyrocketed. Reviewing medical records, they all noted the emergencies occurred shortly after new IV bags had been hung. Patients recalled waking up unexpectedly intubated in intensive care units they had been transported to via emergency medical transportation services, in pain and in fear for their lives.A sentencing date has not yet been set. Ortiz faces a maximum penalty of 190 years in prison. The court will set his sentencing hearing at a later date.FDA-OCI Special Agents Chad Medaris and Daniel Allgeyer investigated the case.Assistant Director Patrick Runkle and Trial Attorney Rachel Baron of the Civil Division's Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorney John de la Garza for the Northern District of Texas prosecuted the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Gail Hayworth for the Northern District of Texas provided appellate support. Chief U.S. District Judge David C.

Wilson.  “This office stands ready to prosecute those who would callously exploit medical patients, and we are grateful to the FDA and the OBN for their outstanding work in investigating this case.”The Honorable Ronald A.

Shah imposed the sentence Wednesday during a hearing in federal court in Chicago.The sentence was announced by Morris Pasqual, Acting United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, and Ronne Malham, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Field Office of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations.  Valuable assistance was provided by the Crystal Lake, Ill., Police Department.  The government was represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Heidi Manschreck.“Patients deserve to have confidence that they are receiving the legitimately prescribed medication and not a diluted substance,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Pasqual.  “Health care practitioners who illicitly tamper with prescription drugs will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”“Patients suffering from pain trust their health care providers to provide relief through effective and appropriately dosed medications,” said SAC Malham.  “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice healthcare professionals who violate their position of trust and jeopardize patients’ health and well-being by tampering with their pain medications.”###"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney's OfficeNorthern District of IowaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEMonday, April 1, 2024One New Mother Suffered “Horrible and Excruciating Pain” as Her Newborn Went UnfedAn Iowa nurse who stole pain medication from at least 50 new mothers at a Waterloo hospital was sentenced on March 27, 2024, in federal court in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Christina Eileen Olson, formerly known as Christina Eileen Hovey, age 43, of Waterloo, received the prison term after pleading guilty on October 12, 2023, to one count of acquiring a controlled substance by misrepresentation, fraud, deception, and subterfuge, one count of adulteration and misbranding with intent to defraud and mislead, and one count of false statements relating to health care matters.At the plea hearing, and in a plea agreement, Olson admitted that the State of Iowa granted her a nursing license in 2004. In 2017, a Waterloo hospital hired Olson to work as a nurse in its labor and delivery unit. Olson was responsible for caring for late-term pregnant women, women in active labor, and post-partum women, including women recovering from recent Caesarean section (“c-section”) surgery. Obstetricians prescribed these women Schedule II narcotics, including hydromorphone, oxycodone, and fentanyl, in order to control physical pain associated with the birthing process.From no later than January 2022, to at least March 25, 2022, Olson used her nursing license to gain access to controlled substances in the hospital’s labor and delivery unit. Instead of administering the controlled substances to the women in pain, Olson diverted the controlled substances to herself for her own illicit drug use. Olson admitted she stole narcotics from no less than 50 victims. In order to cover up her crimes, Olson used a variety of fraudulent means, including falsely documenting that she had administered pain medication to new mothers when she had not done so. Olson also admitted to tampering with pain medication — replacing fentanyl inside a vial with saline and diverting the narcotic for her own use.For example, on March 25, 2022, Olson was supposed to care for three new mothers and their babies during her shift from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m. One of Olson’s victims, known in court documents as “Mother-1,” had given birth via c-section on March 23, 2022, in a high-risk pregnancy. In addition to caring for Mother-1, it was Olson’s responsibility to come into Mother-1’s room and document how much the baby was eating every hour, as this is important to ensure the health of a newborn. Instead of caring for Mother-1 and her baby, however, Olson never came into the room or checked on Mother-1 or her baby or administered pain medication to Mother-1 on March 25, 2023, even though Olson documented in the hospital’s records that she was administering pain medication to Mother-1. Rather, Olson diverted the pain medication to her own use.As a result of Olson’s crimes, Mother-1 suffered “horrible and excruciating pain” on March 25, 2023. Further, because Olson had created false health care records documenting that she had administered the pain medication to Mother-1, the next nurse on shift declined to give pain medication to Mother-1 for at least 30 additional minutes in order to ensure Mother-1 was not feigning her need for narcotics. And despite repeated requests by Mother-1’s husband for formula, Mother-1’s newborn did not receive any formula until the end of Olson’s shift.Another c-section patient, Mother-2, did not speak fluent English. Olson stole needed pain medications from Mother-2, as well. Mother-2’s husband made multiple complaints to the hospital about Mother-2’s pain to no avail.The next day, March 26, 2023, Olson was again working first shift at the hospital. During this shift, the hospital drug tested Olson. The drug test was positive for opiates (oxycodone and hydromorphone) and marijuana. Another nurse then found an open fentanyl vial, an open ephedrine vial, and an epidural bag in another new mother’s room. The hospital’s records revealed that Olson had removed these three items under the new mother’s name despite the fact there were no such orders for her. The fentanyl vial had puncture marks on the top and bottom stopper surfaces, and laboratory results later revealed that nearly all the fentanyl in the vial had been replaced with saline.Olson admitted that she routinely drank alcohol and used marijuana while working at the Waterloo hospital. In order to pass a drug test at the hospital, Olson injected another person’s urine into her bladder. In September 2021, after receiving reports that Olson was disappearing from her shift for extended periods of time, the hospital’s director referred Olson to an employee assistance program. On September 9, 2021, however, Olson took a leave of absence from the hospital for about three months after she was arrested for drunk driving. Olson’s blood alcohol level at the time of her arrest was no less than .274.In July 2022, Olson entered into a settlement agreement with the Iowa Board of Nursing under which she agreed to voluntarily surrender her nursing license for one year. As a part of her plea agreement, Olson has now forfeited her nursing license to the United States.“Ms. Hovey callously stole pain medications from over 50 new mothers, subjecting them to additional suffering during their procedures,” said United States Attorney Timothy T. Duax. “Our office is committed to protecting new mothers, and all medical patients, from such violations of trust by prosecuting health care employees who prey on their patients.”“Patients rely on the knowledge that they will receive FDA-approved medications to manage their pain,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles Grinstead, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Kansas City Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice healthcare professionals who jeopardize patients’ health by interfering with their pain medications.”Olson was sentenced in Cedar Rapids by United States District Court Chief Judge C.J. Williams. Olson was sentenced to one year and one day of imprisonment. She must also serve a three-year term of supervised release after the prison term. There is no parole in the federal system.The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Timothy L. Vavricek and was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Inspector General, and the Iowa Medicaid Fraud Control Unit.Court file information athttps://ecf.iand.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/login.pl.The case file number is 23-CR-2055.###"

Talbert announced.Tieu was the President and Chief Executive Officer of Golden Sunrise Pharmaceutical Inc. and Golden Sunrise Nutraceutical Inc. (collectively, “Golden Sunrise”). Golden Sunrise manufactured, marketed, and sold products that claimed to effectively treat a variety of medical conditions.According to court documents, beginning on March 30, 2020, Tieu began selling a set of herbal mixtures he called the “Emergency D-Virus Plan of Care” as a COVID-19 treatment. The treatment consisted of a box containing various vials of Golden Sunrise drug products, including one called “Imunstem,” together with an “Emergency D-Virus Plan of Care” information sheet. Tieu mailed the products to various practitioners, public officials, and other individuals both inside and outside of California.According to court documents, the labeling for the drugs, including the information sheet that accompanied the drugs, was false and misleading and stated that ImunStem and other Golden Sunrise products were “uniquely qualified to treat and modify the course of the virus epidemic in China and other countries.” Tieu falsely claimed the products had been the first dietary supplement in the United States to be approved as a prescription medicine by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat the COVID-19 virus. In fact, the drugs were not FDA approved, and no Golden Sunrise product had ever been approved by the FDA for any purpose.This case is the product of an investigation by FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation with assistance from the Tulare County District Attorney’s Office. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jeffrey A. Spivak and Emilia P.E. Morris are prosecuting the case.Tieu is scheduled to be sentenced before U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara A. McAuliffe on June 12, 2024. Tieu faces a maximum statutory penalty of one year in prison and a $100,000 fine on each of the three counts. The actual sentence, however, will be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables.###"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney's OfﬁceOffice of Public AffairsFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, March 6, 2024KVK Research Inc., a generic drug manufacturer in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, pleaded guilty today to criminal charges that it introduced adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.A criminal information filed in federal court in Philadelphia charged KVK Research and its corporate affiliate, KVK Tech Inc., with two misdemeanor counts of introducing adulterated drugs into interstate commerce in violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). Pursuant to a plea agreement, KVK Research pleaded guilty to the information and agreed to a proposed fine and forfeiture amount of $1.5 million.KVK Tech agreed to a three-year deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) that will allow the company to avoid conviction on the charges in the information if it complies with the terms of the agreement, which include implementation of a compliance program designed to prevent and detect violations of federal regulations regarding current good manufacturing processes. The DPA also requires KVK Tech to engage an independent compliance monitor to evaluate the company’s corporate compliance program to address and reduce the risk of future violations.U.S. District Judge Harvey Bartle III presided over the KVK Research plea hearing.“Consumers have a right to expect that the drugs they purchase are safe and manufactured in compliance with the FDCA and FDA regulations,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Justice Department will continue to work with FDA to prosecute companies that put consumers at risk by selling adulterated drugs.”“Consumers in this District expect that manufacturers will adhere to FDA regulations,” said U.S. Attorney Jacqueline C. Romero for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. “When adulterated drugs are introduced into interstate commerce, that conduct has the potential to jeopardize patient safety. This case exemplifies my office’s commitment to holding manufacturers responsible for their crimes, as well as refocusing efforts on the company’s compliance to prevent future illegal conduct. In this case, the joint efforts between the office’s criminal and civil divisions to hold defendants accountable also returned money to those federal agencies affected by the defendants’ conduct.”“The FDA’s requirements for manufacturing generic drugs are designed to ensure that patients receive safe and effective medical treatments. Evading the FDA process and distributing adulterated drugs to U.S. consumers will not be tolerated,” said Special Agent in Charge George Scavdis of the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Metro Washington Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and protect the public health of the nation.”As part of the plea agreement and the DPA, the companies admitted that between January 2011 and October 2013, KVK Tech introduced into interstate commerce at least 62 batches of adulterated hydroxyzine tablets. The tablets were manufactured with an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) made at a foreign facility. KVK Tech failed to notify FDA or seek FDA authorization to use that facility as a source of API for its hydroxyzine products. The companies also admitted that between Feb. 27, 2019, and April 16, 2019, KVK Tech manufactured prescription drugs while failing to exercise appropriate controls over computer and related systems as required by current good manufacturing practices regulations. Under federal law, such drugs are deemed to be adulterated.Additionally, KVK Tech agreed to pay $2 million to resolve its civil liability under the False Claims Act arising from the company’s failure to exercise appropriate controls as required by current good manufacturing practice regulations, which caused KVK Tech to introduce into interstate commerce drugs deemed to be adulterated. During the Feb. 27, 2019, through April 16, 2019, time period, KVK Tech sold the adulterated pharmaceuticals, which resulted in alleged false claims submitted to the TRICARE program, Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), Veterans Administration (VA) and Department of Labor, Office of Workers Compensation Programs (DOL-OWCP), in violation of the False Claims Act.“Protecting the welfare of our nation’s military members and their families is a priority for the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), the law enforcement arm of the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Brian J. Solecki of the DCIS Northeast Field Office. “The introduction of adulterated pharmaceuticals into the TRICARE system endangers the lives of American service members and threatens our military readiness. The DCIS is committed to working with the Justice Department and our law enforcement partners to ensure that companies who engage in fraudulent activity, at the expense of the U.S. military, are investigated and prosecuted.”“We expect manufacturers to comply with all federal laws and regulations when they are serving federal health care recipients,” said Deputy Assistant Inspector General for Investigations Conrad J. Quarles of the Office of Personnel Management Office of the Inspector General. “We applaud our investigative staff, and our law enforcement partners for their hard work protecting FEHBP enrollees and their families.”FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations investigated the case.Assistant Director Ross S. Goldstein and Trial Attorney Alisha Crovetto of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorneys M. Beth Leahy and Patrick Murray for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania are prosecuting the case. Deputy Chief Charlene Keller Fullmer, Assistant U.S. Attorney Anthony D.

Vulto oversaw operations at Vulto Creamery manufacturing facility in Walton, New York, including those relating to sanitation and environmental monitoring. In pleading guilty, Vulto and Vulto Creamery admitted that between December 2014 and March 2017, they caused the shipment in interstate commerce of adulterated cheese.According to the plea agreement, environmental swabs taken at the Vulto Creamery facility between approximately July 2014 and February 2017 repeatedly tested positive for Listeria species. The Listeria family includes both harmless species and L. monocytogenes, which can cause listeriosis in humans. In March 2017, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) linked Vulto Creamery’s cheese to an outbreak of listeriosis, Vulto shut down the Vulto Creamery facility and issued a partial recall that was expanded to a full recall within weeks. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the listeriosis outbreak resulted in eight hospitalizations and two deaths.“It is crucial that American consumers be able to trust that the foods they buy are safe to eat,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The department will continue to work with its law enforcement partners to hold responsible food manufacturers that sell dangerously contaminated products.”“This investigation and prosecution holds accountable the defendant and his business who through unsafe practices caused illness and death to consumers in an entirely preventable tragedy,” said U.S. Attorney Carla B. Freedman for the Northern District of New York. “The law enforcement and regulatory partners involved in this case will continue to work together to bring to justice those who endanger the public through unsafe and unsanitary products and facilities.”“U.S. consumers rely on the FDA to ensure that their food is safe and wholesome,” said Special Agent in Charge Fernando McMillan of FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations New York Field Office. “When companies and individuals put themselves above the law by producing food that endangers and harms the public, as occurred in this case, we will see that they are brought to justice.”Listeriosis is a severe, invasive illness that can be life-threatening in some cases. Persons who have the greatest risk of experiencing listeriosis due to consumption of foods contaminated with L. monocytogenes are pregnant women and their newborns, the elderly and persons with weakened immune systems.Vulto and Vulto Creamery pleaded guilty before Magistrate Judge Thérèse Wiley Dancks in Syracuse, New York. A sentencing date will be set by the court. Further information about the case will be posted under “Information for Victims in Large Cases” at the Consumer Protection Branch’s website:www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch.The FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations investigated the case.Senior Trial Attorney James T.

After making numerous controlled purchases from “MonPham” between October 27, 2021, and August 25, 2022, law enforcement traced cryptocurrency transactions to the defendants’ Internet Protocol (IP) address. Law enforcement then observed Bangurah mailing fentanyl packages to customers and later observed one of the defendants with an infant child entering the residence.While executing a search warrant on August 31, 2022, law enforcement discovered the trio’s drug lab, pills, binding agents, drug ledgers, and numerous electronic devices that contained hundreds of text messages between Nabyunissa and Franklin detailing the day-to-day operation of the conspiracy. Based on the drug ledgers, law enforcement determined the conspirators sold approximately 3,000 counterfeit oxycodone pills and approximately 55,000 counterfeit Xanax pills. In most cases, the counterfeit oxycodone pills contained fentanyl, while the counterfeit Xanax contained benzodiazepines.Franklin, Nabyunissa, and Tanziludin each pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute 40 grams or more of fentanyl.

The criminal resolution includes the second-largest set of criminal financial penalties ever levied against a pharmaceutical company, including a criminal fine of $1.086 billion and an additional $450 million in criminal forfeiture. The proposed resolution includes a corporate criminal release regarding conduct relating to the sale, marketing, and distribution of Opana ER, but does not release any individual criminal liability.EHSI also has agreed to a civil settlement of $475.6 million to resolve its civil liability under the False Claims Act (FCA). The civil settlement will address alleged losses to federal healthcare programs that paid for Opana ER.Endo International plc and several of its affiliates, including EHSI (together, Endo), commenced Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the Southern District of New York on Aug. 16, 2022. Today, the United States announced that it also reached an agreement to resolve all of its monetary claims against the debtors — including the claims arising from the criminal plea and civil settlement — in Endo’s bankruptcy cases. In addition to the criminal and civil settlement resolutions, the bankruptcy settlement provides payment for claims for unpaid taxes and for costs incurred by federal healthcare agencies to treat individuals harmed by Endo’s products. As noted, under the bankruptcy agreement, the government will be paid up to $464.9 million over 10 years.“Companies that profit from the opioid abuse epidemic by misrepresenting the safety of their opioid products and using reckless marketing tactics to increase sales threaten the health and safety of Americans,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “With today’s announcement of a criminal guilty plea and a substantial civil settlement, the Justice Department re-affirms its commitment to holding accountable those whose illegal conduct contributed to the opioid crisis.”“Chapter 11 is an important tool for businesses to preserve value for their stakeholders. Bankruptcy protections are not a free pass to evade responsibility for criminal misconduct, civil fraud, or taxes,” said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. “Today’s settlement ensures that Endo takes responsibility for its past misconduct, pays its federal debts, helps abate the nation’s opioid crisis by funding evidence-based treatment programs at the state and local level and distributes payments to individuals harmed by the opioid epidemic.”“Combating the opioid epidemic remains a top public health priority for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),” said Director Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D. of FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “This case demonstrates FDA and the Justice Department’s commitment to work collaboratively to hold drug manufacturers accountable if they fail to share accurate information with health care professionals about the risks and benefits of opioids.”“The metrics of the opioid crisis are staggering. When companies do not provide accurate information about the safety and abuse potential of their products, they put patients at risk of abuse and addiction,” said Associate Commissioner Michael Rogers of FDA’s Regulatory Affairs. “Such conduct will not be tolerated, and we will aggressively pursue and bring to justice those who endanger the public health in this manner.”One important condition in the resolution is that Endo would cease to operate in its current form and would not emerge from the bankruptcy. Moreover, as part of its resolution with the opioid claimants, Endo’s affiliates have agreed to a Voluntary Operating Injunction that restrains opioid marketing and sales and requires Endo to turn over millions of documents related to its role in the opioid crisis for publication in a public online archive.The Criminal PleaAs part of the plea, EHSI will admit that from April 2012 through May 2013, certain EHSI sales representatives marketed Opana ER to prescribers by touting Opana ER’s purported abuse deterrence, tamper resistance, and/or crush resistance, despite a lack of clinical data supporting those claims. According to the plea agreement, certain EHSI sales managers were aware that the sales representatives were making claims of purported abuse deterrence, tamper resistance, and/or crush resistance during sales calls, including hitting demonstration “blister packs” of non-medicated sample pills with hammers and conducting other demonstrations to convey the message that Opana ER was, in fact, crush proof and tamper resistant. The approved labeling for Opana ER did not provide adequate information for healthcare providers to safely prescribe Opana ER for use as an opioid that is abuse deterrent. According to the plea agreement, EHSI was responsible for the misbranding of Opana ER by marketing the drug with a label that failed to include adequate directions for its claimed abuse deterrence use, in violation of the FDCA.EHSI voluntarily withdrew Opana ER from the market in 2017.The Civil SettlementThe civil settlement announced today resolves allegations that, from 2011 to 2017, EHSI used a marketing scheme that targeted healthcare providers that EHSI knew were prescribing Opana ER for non-medically accepted indications. Aware that fewer than 10% of Opana ER prescribers wrote more than half of all Opana ER prescriptions, EHSI allegedly sought to increase its revenue from Opana ER prescriptions by focusing its marketing on those healthcare providers who prescribed the highest levels of opioids in general and Opana ER in particular. When EHSI employees raised concerns about targeting prescribers believed to be engaged in abuse, diversion or pill mill prescribing, EHSI allegedly ignored or minimized such concerns and continued to directly market Opana ER to such prescribers.The allegations resolved by the civil settlement relating to EHSI’s marketing activities include that in 2015, after marketing the reformulated Opana ER for years, EHSI sought to further increase prescriptions by partnering with a consulting company to “pull[] all the levers” it could “to drive incremental growth” of Opana ER prescriptions. In what it termed a “sales force blitz,” EHSI allegedly added 3,000 priority targets to its sales representatives’ call lists, with nearly all of these priority targets chosen because they prescribed a high volume of opioids in general or Opana ER in particular. EHSI allegedly used sales goals and contests to ensure that its sales representatives targeted these outlier prescribers, including prescribers who previously had been excluded from EHSI’s call lists as posing risks of abuse and diversion.The Bankruptcy ResolutionAs part of Endo’s bankruptcy plan, a group of Endo’s secured lenders will purchase Endo’s assets and operate the business under a new corporate structure. Under the bankruptcy agreement negotiated by the United States to resolve its claims against Endo, this new business will pay the United States $364.9 million over 10 years, which can be prepaid at $200 million on the bankruptcy plan’s effective date, plus up to an additional $100 million contingent on the business performance of the new company.The bankruptcy agreement resolves multiple federal claims against Endo, including the claims arising from the criminal and civil settlements, as well as tax claims and the claims of various federal healthcare agencies. The settlement agreement further precludes the new company from acquiring any unused tax credits or other beneficial tax attributes of Endo. Additionally, the new company will fund voluntary trusts in settlement of opioid-related claims against Endo, including public trusts that will pay over $450 million to state, municipal and Tribal entities to help fund programs to abate the opioid crisis. The department will credit up to $450 million of such payments against the agreed forfeiture amount.In addition to the criminal and civil claims described above, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed substantial tax claims in the bankruptcy proceeding against Endo based on ongoing audits. These audits concerned, among other things, Endo’s valuation of assets it transferred to foreign affiliates and its payment of a large loan pre-payment penalty to a foreign affiliate for which it sought a tax deduction. A substantial majority of these payments were entitled to priority over Endo’s other unsecured claims.Finally, HHS’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), HHS’s Indian Health Service and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) asserted claims in the bankruptcy proceeding against Endo for the costs these programs incurred in providing medical care to treat individuals who suffer from opioid-use disorder as a result of their use of Opana ER and other opioids manufactured and sold by Endo. CMS has also filed a claim to recover costs it incurred based on beneficiaries’ use of other Endo products, including transvaginal mesh and ranitidine.When Endo filed for bankruptcy in August 2022, it proposed to sell substantially all of its assets in a manner that contravened key requirements of the Bankruptcy Code. Endo’s original proposal would have provided virtually no recovery to the federal government on account of its claims, while improperly paying several other creditor groups on account of their claims, even though they were entitled to lower or equal priority as certain government claims. The current bankruptcy settlement was achieved after the government objected to the proposed sale in Bankruptcy Court. Through this settlement, the government has ensured both that it is compensated for its claims and that Endo does not run afoul of the Bankruptcy Code by paying only certain of its creditors or violating the Bankruptcy Code’s priority scheme.“The opioid crisis remains a public health emergency nationwide, and those impacted are at the forefront of our work,” said the Honorable Christi A. Grimm, HHS Inspector General. “The HHS Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) is staunchly committed to protecting the millions of people served by federal healthcare programs from schemes such as this, while also striving to ensure they have access to necessary treatment.”“The misbranding of opioids negatively impacts the integrity of TRICARE, the military’s healthcare system relied on by more than nine million service members, retirees and their families,” said the Honorable Robert P. Storch, Department of Defense Inspector General. “Today’s settlement demonstrates the ongoing commitment of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and its law enforcement partners to promote accountability and transparency throughout the pharmaceutical industry and prosecute those who put profits ahead of patient welfare. The delivery of quality healthcare is too important to let a single dollar go to waste.”“Veterans and their families expect and deserve the highest quality health care delivered in a safe and accountable setting. False or misleading claims about potentially dangerous drugs put veterans’ care at risk,” said the Honorable Michael J. Missal, VA Inspector General. “The VA Office of Inspector General is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to ensure the safety of those who entrust their health care to the providers and staff at VA’s 1,300 medical facilities.”“Protecting the health and safety of Federal employees, annuitants, and their families is a top priority for OPM OIG,” said Special Agent in Charge Derek M. Holt of the Office of Personnel Management Office of Inspector General (OPM-OIG). “Today’s criminal and civil resolutions demonstrate the exemplary work of our investigative staff, law enforcement partners, and colleagues at the Justice Department in holding manufacturers accountable for actions that contribute to the opioid epidemic.”The criminal investigation was conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Administration, HHS-OIG, Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, VA Office of Inspector General, OPM-OIG, Defense Criminal Investigative Service and Amtrak Office of Inspector General.The criminal matter was handled by Assistant Director Gabriel H.

TRICARE is the health care beneﬁt program for United States military members and their families. During that interview, Smith lied to agents about his role in the scheme. Smith falsely claimed, for example, that he played no role in hiring the marketing groups and that he didn’t know they were directly soliciting TRICARE beneﬁciaries.In all, PCA paid over $40 million in kickbacks to the marketers for recruiting and referring TRICARE beneﬁciary prescriptions for expensive, unnecessary compounded medications to PCA. To date, over a dozen of PCA’s marketers and employees have been convicted and sentenced for their roles in the scheme. The government has recovered more than $30 million in fraud proceeds from PCA and the individual defendants.Smith was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Roy K. Altman.

        "content": "Department of JusticeUnited States Attorney's OfficeEastern District of ArkansasFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEMonday, February 26, 2024Largest Ever Monetary Criminal Penalty in Food Safety MatterLITTLE ROCK - Family Dollar Stores LLC pleaded guilty today to holding food, drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics under insanitary conditions, related to a rodent infestation at the company’s West Memphis, Arkansas, distribution center.A criminal information unsealed today in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, charged Family Dollar with one misdemeanor count of causing FDA-regulated products to become adulterated while being held under insanitary conditions. The company, a subsidiary of Dollar Tree Inc., entered into a plea agreement that includes a sentence of a fine and forfeiture amount totaling $41.675 million, the largest-ever monetary criminal penalty in a food safety case. The plea agreement also requires Family Dollar and Dollar Tree to meet robust corporate compliance and reporting requirements for the next three years. U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerome T. Kearney presided over the company’s guilty plea and sentencing at today’s hearing.“When consumers go to the store, they have the right to expect that the food and drugs on the shelves have been kept in clean, uncontaminated conditions,” said Acting Associate Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer. “When companies violate that trust and the laws designed to keep consumers safe, the public should rest assured: The Justice Department will hold those companies accountable.”“Companies distributing and selling food, drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics must ensure that these products are being held in safe and sanitary conditions,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Justice Department will continue to work closely with the FDA to investigate and prosecute those who put public health at risk by failing to meet this important obligation.”“Consumers trust that products purchased from retail stores such as Family Dollar are safe,” said U.S. Attorney Jonathan D. Ross for the Eastern District of Arkansas. “It is incomprehensible that Family Dollar knew about the rodent and pest issues at its distribution center in Arkansas but continued to ship products that were unsafe and insanitary. Knowingly selling these types of products not only places the public’s health at risk but erodes the trust consumers have in the products they purchase. Products shipped and sold are required to be safe for consumers and the safety of Arkansans and others are extremely important to this office. Let me be clear, if you conduct business in Arkansas and allow the shipment or sale of unsafe and insanitary products, you will be held accountable.”“U.S. consumers rely on the FDA to ensure that their food is safe and wholesome,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L. Grinstead of the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI) Kansas City Field Office. “When companies put themselves above the law and distribute food that has been held under extremely insanitary conditions, putting the public’s health at risk, we will see that they are brought to justice.”In pleading guilty, the company admitted that its Arkansas distribution center shipped FDA-regulated products to more than 400 Family Dollar stores in Alabama, Missouri, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee. According to the plea agreement, the company began receiving reports in August 2020 of mouse and pest issues with deliveries to stores. By the end of 2020, certain stores reported receiving rodents and rodent-damaged products from the warehouse. The company admitted that by no later than January 2021, some of its employees were aware that the insanitary conditions caused FDA-regulated products held at the warehouse to become adulterated in violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA).According to the plea agreement, the company continued to ship FDA-regulated products from the warehouse until January 2022, when an FDA inspection revealed live rodents, dead and decaying rodents, rodent feces, urine, and odors, and evidence of gnawing and nesting throughout the facility. According to the plea agreement, subsequent fumigation of the facility resulted in the reported extermination of 1,270 rodents. On Feb. 18, 2022, the company voluntarily recalled all drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, and human and animal food products sold since Jan. 1, 2021 in the 404 stores that had been serviced by the warehouse.FDA-OCI Special Agents Chad Medaris and Daniel Allgeyer investigated the case.Senior Litigation Counsel Patrick Runkle and Trial Attorney Alisha Crovetto of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Julie Peters and Cameron McCree for the Eastern District of Arkansas prosecuted the case.Additional information about the Consumer Protection Branch and its enforcement efforts can be found atwww.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch.###"

U.S. District Court Judge Angel Kelley scheduled sentencing for June 12, 2024. Sheehan was charged by Information in November 2023.While working at a Massachusetts hospital, Sheehan removed a bag of intravenous fentanyl solution from an automated dispensing machine. Sheehan used a syringe to remove fentanyl from the IV bag, injected saline into the bag to replace the fentanyl she had removed and returned the bag to its drawer in the machine. A hospital employee removed the IV bag, which laboratory testing confirmed contained less than the declared concentration of fentanyl, from the machine before any of the adulterated fentanyl solution was administered to a patient. Sheehan later admitted that she had withdrawn fentanyl from the IV bag and replaced it with saline to avoid getting caught.The charge of adulteration of a prescription drug provides a sentence of no greater than three years in prison, one year of supervised release and a fine of up to $10,000.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney's OfﬁceEastern District of PennsylvaniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, February 16, 2024Promising to restore the health of terminally ill dogs, defendant defrauded approximately 900 pet owners out of nearly $1 millionPHILADELPHIA – United States Attorney Jacqueline C. Romero announced that Jonathan Nyce, 73, of Collegeville, Pennsylvania, was sentenced today to 97 months in prison, three years of supervised release, and a $500 special assessment for carrying out a years-long scheme to defraud pet owners of money by falsely claiming to sell drugs that could cure canine cancer. A federal jury convicted Nyce of wire fraud and the interstate shipment of misbranded animal drugs in December 2022.In perpetrating the scheme, Nyce created several companies, including “Canine Care,” “ACGT,” and “CAGT,” through which he purported to develop drugs intended to treat cancer in dogs. Beginning in 2012, using various websites for these companies, the defendant marketed these “cancer-curing” medications to desperate pet owners, using the drug names “Tumexal” and “Naturasone.” The websites made numerous false and fraudulent claims regarding the safety and efﬁcacy of these supposed drugs, including that “Tumexal is effective against a wide variety of cancers,” and, “[i]n fact, Tumexal will almost always restore a cancer-stricken dog’s appetite, spirit and energy!” In reality, these drugs were nothing more than a collection of bulk ingredients from various sources, which the defendant blended together himself at a facility on Arcola Road in Collegeville.Further, through email and telephone conversations, Nyce induced the owners of terminally ill dogs to pay him hundreds or thousands of dollars for these drugs by touting the effectiveness of his products in treating a host of canine cancers. He also told prospective customers that their pets could become part of clinical trials, but in order to do so, they had to pay him large sums of money. Evidence presented at trial showed the defendant sold nearly $1,000,000 worth of drugs to approximately 900 different victims. The defendant’s marketing, sale, and shipment of these drugs violated the Food and Drug Administration’s Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act because the drugs were not approved by the FDA. The defendant even falsely claimed in promotional materials that his company’s research was “funded in part by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.”“In shopping these worthless ‘drugs’ to desperate pet owners, Jonathan Nyce’s actions were both criminal and cruel,” said U.S. Attorney Romero. “He deliberately exploited people’s emotions, their love for their ailing dogs, purely for his own ﬁnancial gain. Many people consider dogs members of their families, so they’re especially vulnerable to such schemes. For defrauding his victims and thumbing his nose at the FDA, justice demanded that Mr. Nyce be held accountable.”“The FDA’s animal drug approval process ensures that our pets receive safe and effective products. Ignoring the FDA’s requirements and selling unapproved drugs to vulnerable U.S. consumers will not be tolerated,” said George A. Scavdis, Special Agent in Charge of the FDA Ofﬁce of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Ofﬁce. “We will aggressively pursue and bring to justice those criminals who place proﬁts above the health and safety of animal patients.”The case was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration’s Ofﬁce of Criminal Investigation with assistance from the Consumer Protection Branch of the Department of Justice and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Christopher E. Paris.###"

Stabile, 37, of Pasadena, Calif., was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Mark G. Mastroianni to two years in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release. Stabile was also ordered to pay a forfeiture of $1,833,922. In September 2023, Stabile pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and two counts of introduction of misbranded drugs with intent to defraud and mislead.“Mr. Stabile knew how addicting and dangerous tianeptine was and yet it did not stop him from smuggling the illegal drug into the United States and selling it under false pretenses,” said Acting United States Attorney Joshua S. Levy. “He continued to profit off the addiction of others even after he was indicted.”“Misbranded and unapproved drugs that are smuggled from overseas can present a serious health risk to those who buy and use them. Tianeptine is an unsafe drug that is not approved for any use in the United States. All smuggled drugs carry additional risks of unknown ingredients and unknown manufacturing conditions,” said Fernando McMillan, Special Agent in Charge of the United States Food and Drug Administration’s Ofﬁce of Criminal Investigation, New York Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who attempt to trafﬁc in these dangerous, misbranded, and unapproved drug products.”Stabile was the owner of Supplements for Work, a company which sold the misbranded drug tianeptine, commonly known as gas station heroin, online. Stabile, through his company, marketed tianeptine as a mood enhancer and claimed that it improved cognitive functioning and falsely represented that he was selling tianeptine for research purposes only, even though he sold tianeptine to individuals for personal use.Stabile smuggled tianeptine in multi-kilogram quantities from China into the United States, importing between 10-15 kilograms of tianeptine per month from a Chinese supplier. Once received, Stabile divided and repackaged the tianeptine and resold it on his websites in ﬁve- gram, 10-gram and 20-gram quantities for prices between $55 and $175. Stabile’s tianeptine sales averaged $250,000 per month and comprised 95 percent of his company’s proﬁts.Additionally, following his indictment by a federal grand jury in November 2019, Stabile continued to sell tianeptine on the internet for several years while on pre-trial release, under a different company and website called Ultra Vulgar Festival Drip.In total, Stabile made at least $2.2 million in illegal tianeptine sales.###"

As part of the agreement, Covetrus will pay over $23 million in criminal ﬁnes and forfeitures.“The United States Attorney’s Ofﬁce for the Western District of Virginia takes the distribution of misbranded prescription drugs seriously,” United States Attorney Christopher R. Kavanaugh said today. “Covetrus shipped over $20 million in prescription drugs to unauthorized end-users in violation of federal laws that are designed to ensure prescription drugs are kept within a controlled chain of distribution and to prevent diversion and inappropriate use. Today’s result demonstrates my Ofﬁce’s commitment to holding those companies and corporations accountable when they seek to proﬁt by breaking the law.”“The FDA recognizes the importance of controlling the prescription drug supply for animals. The careless or uncontrolled distribution of prescription animal drugs poses a danger not only to the medicated animals but to the U.S. public health by increasing the risk that humans will become resistant to antibiotics that we unknowingly consume through our food supply.” said Special Agent in Charge George Scavdis, FDA Ofﬁce of Criminal Investigations, Metro Washington Field Ofﬁce. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who distribute prescription animal drugs unlawfully.”According to court documents, from March 2019 to December 2021, Covetrus shipped over $20 million in prescription drugs from their non-pharmacy locations throughout the United States to end-users that were not authorized to receive prescription drugs. Shipments from non- pharmacy locations to non-authorized end-users or locations are deemed “misbranded.”Covetrus will forfeit $21,534,091, pay $1,000,000 to the Virginia Department of Health Professions, as well as a ﬁne of $1,000,000.

U.S. District Court Judge Margaret R. Guzman scheduled sentencing for May 15, 2024. The defendant was indicted by a federal grand jury in August 2020 and subsequently charged in a superseding indictment in June 2021.“For roughly a decade, this defendant manipulated and exploited our healthcare system. He circumvented the FDA approval process for drugs from overseas – systems established to protect and support public health and safety,” said Acting United States Attorney Joshua S. Levy. “This conduct jeopardized patient safety and undermined the very foundation of our regulatory system. Such conduct will never be tolerated.”“U.S. consumers rely on the FDA to ensure that the medications they take are safe and effective. Unlawful, misbranded medical drugs put consumers’ health at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Fernando McMillian, FDA Ofﬁce of Criminal Investigations’ New York Field Ofﬁce. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who place proﬁts above consumers’ health.”“This defendant orchestrated a scheme that jeopardized the health of vulnerable patients seeking help with their addiction,” said Special Agent in Charge Roberto Coviello of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Ofﬁce of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “As this conviction demonstrates, HHS-OIG and our law enforcement partners will continue working together to protect both public safety and our health care system.”Shafa was a psychiatrist who owned and operated Novel Psychopharmacology. From approximately January 2008 through January 2018, Shafa engaged in an international money laundering scheme to purchase naltrexone pellet implants as well as disulﬁram pellet implants and injections from Hong Kong. Naltrexone and disulﬁram are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in certain forms for the treatment of alcohol dependence and alcohol and opioid dependence, respectively. However, the implantable pellet form of the drug that Shafa purchased are not approved by the FDA. Shafa falsiﬁed shipping documents to conceal that the packages containing the drugs were shipped from Hong Kong to Shafa in Massachusetts.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney's OfﬁceWestern District of MichiganFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, February 7, 2024GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN – U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Michigan Mark Totten today announced that Steven William Anderson, Jr., 45, of Selinsgrove, PA, was sentenced to 78 months in prison for his role in a multi-year conspiracy to trafﬁc stolen diabetic test strips from the Battle Creek Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center. During Anderson’s sentencing, Chief U.S. District Judge Hala Y. Jarbou emphasized the harm to the VA, veterans who rely on VA services, and the taxpayers.“Anderson trafﬁcked stolen goods while pocketing thousands of dollars in ill-gotten gain,” said U.S. Attorney Mark Totten. “Not only did Anderson steal from the government, but he diverted medical products intended for veterans who faithfully served our nation. Today’s sentence brings a measure of justice for taxpayers and those who serve the United States in uniform.”In June 2023, a jury found Anderson guilty of all twelve charges against him following a three-day trial. In total, Anderson trafﬁcked over 7,900 boxes of stolen diabetic test strips worth over $427,795. Anderson’s co-conspirators, Jennifer Robertson, 53, of Battle Creek, MI, and Michelle McAllister, 57, of Jerome, MI, pled guilty and were sentenced to prison last year.The United States expects to receive a total recovery from Anderson of more than $1.6 million. He agreed to pay over $1.2 million to resolve the government’s civil claims arising from his misconduct. He was ordered to pay the full value of the stolen diabetic test strips he trafﬁcked, $427,795.23, as part of his criminal judgment.Robertson was employed at the Battle Creek VA Pharmacy, where she was responsible for ordering supplies for veterans in need of medical care. Beginning in June 2017, Robertson stole diabetic test strips from pharmacy inventory and arranged to meet McAllister and sell them for cash. McAllister in turn sold and shipped them to Anderson in Pennsylvania. Their scheme unraveled when Robertson was caught stealing in November 2019.“Stolen medical products can present a health risk to those who buy and use them,” said Special Agent in Charge Ronne G. Malham, FDA Ofﬁce of Criminal Investigations Chicago Field Ofﬁce. “FDA will continue to protect the public by investigating and bringing to justice those who compromise the nation’s healthcare programs.”“These crimes are especially troubling because they violated the integrity of the healthcare system that serves our nation’s veterans,” said Special Agent in Charge Gregory Billingsley, Central Field Ofﬁce, Department of Veterans Affairs Ofﬁce of the Inspector General. “Today’s sentences demonstrate the VA OIG’s commitment to holding accountable those who illegally enrich themselves at taxpayer expense.”All three co-conspirators were convicted and agreed to civil penalty settlements under the Strengthening and Focusing Enforcement to Deter Organized Stealing and Enhance Safety Act (the “SAFE DOSES Act”), 18 U.S.C. § 670. Congress passed the SAFE DOSES Act in 2012 to combat the theft of medical products to protect the health and safety of patients. The law includes enhancements for members of the supply chain who knowingly trafﬁc in stolen medical products. Because of his role as a distributor of medical products, Chief Judge Jarbou applied an enhancement to Anderson for his role in the conspiracy.This investigation was led by the FDA’s Ofﬁce of Criminal Investigations and the VA Ofﬁce of Inspector General, with assistance from the United States Postal Inspection Service and the Battle Creek VA Police. The criminal case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Patrick Castle and Andrew Hull. Assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan Cobb represented the United States in the civil settlement.###"

Young announces.Centera Bioscience, d/b/a Nootropics Depot, was sentenced by U.S. Magistrate Judge Talesha Saint-Marc to three years of probation. The company’s CEO, Paul Eftang, 38, wassentenced to one year of probation. The defendants have also paid a $2.4 million forfeiture and surrendered all drugs seized by the FDA and Customs and Border Protection. On October 30, 2023, Centera and Eftang pleaded guilty to the introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce.“The defendants sold Tianeptine and other drugs that were not approved by the FDA,” U.S. Attorney Jane E. Young said. “The FDA has a strict drug approval process to protectconsumers from products that are unsafe or ineffective. Eftang and Centera Bioscience made substantial effort to sell misbranded drugs, which has consequences under federal law. This Office will continue to prosecute those who risk consumer’s health and safety.”“Unapproved drugs present a serious health risk to those who buy and use them. The drugs can contain unknown ingredients and are manufactured under unknown conditions,” said Special Agent in Charge Fernando McMillian, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ New York Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who attempt to traffic in dangerous and unapproved drugs including tianeptine and other chemicals trafficked by this organization.”“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service is committed to keeping the U.S. Mail, its employees, and customers safe. When the U.S. Mail is used to transport unapproved drugs suchas Tianeptine, it is taken very seriously,” said Ketty Larco-Ward, Inspector in Charge of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Boston Division. “We will continue to conduct investigations, alongside our law enforcement partners, that seek prosecution of those who compromise the safety of the American public.”Tianeptine, adrafinil, phenibut, and racetams are pharmaceutical drugs not approved for use in the United States. Racetams include piracetam, aniracetam, coluracetam, and phenylpiracetam. The defendants imported approximately $7.4 million worth of raw material for these drugs from China between April 2017 and September 2021. The defendants earned approximately $35 million from selling these drugs during that same time period. The defendants sold the drugs across the United States, and at one point used Mexican intermediaries to ship the products.During this investigation, Customs detained several shipments of adrafinil and racetams addressed to Centera Bioscience or one of its subsidiaries. These shipments included 20 barrels of phenibut hydrochloride from Shanghai Norky Pharmaceutical, 40 barrels of piracetam from Shanghai Soyoung Biotechnology, and 20 barrels of phenibut hydrochloride from Qingdao Sincess. The company’s Strategic Director, Paul Sheard, represented to Customs that the shipments were supposed to be used for laboratory analysis and research only, and were not intended for human consumption. The customs paperwork also incorrectly labeled the imports.The defendants also maintained an active online presence to advertise tianeptine, phenibut, and racetams, including a sub-forum on the website Reddit. Eftang himself posted regularly on Reddit under the username “MisterYouAreSoDumb.”The Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations and U.S. Postal Inspection Service led the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Alexander S. Chen and Geoffrey W.R. Ward, and FDA Special Counsel Sarah Hawkins prosecuted the case.###"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney's OfficeEastern District of PennsylvaniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, January 24, 2024The Justice Department announced today that a federal judge sentenced a Philadelphia-area man to prison yesterday for his role in distributing medical devices without U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance.Peter Stoll III, 35, pleaded guilty last year to one felony count of violating the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) by causing the introduction of misbranded and adulterated medical devices into interstate commerce. U.S. District Judge Joseph F. Leeson sentenced Stoll to 12 months in prison and one year of supervised release.According to court documents, Stoll was a regulatory affairs specialist at a medical device manufacturer located in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and was responsible for making submissions to the FDA that were required before the company could sell its medical devices. In pleading guilty, Stoll admitted that in 2017, he created two false letters that purported to show that FDA had granted clearance to sell two different medical devices. As a result, the company illegally sold tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of medical devices throughout the United States.According to court documents, Stoll was responsible for shepherding two of the company’s devices through the FDA’s 510(k) clearance process: the ELAN-4 Air Drill, a high-speed surgical drill used for bone cutting, sawing and drilling, and the JS Series SterilContainer S2, a reusable sterilization container for medical instruments. Stoll admitted that he never submitted any 510(k) documents to FDA regarding either device. Instead, Stoll created a fraudulent letter using FDA letterhead and bearing the forged digital signature of an FDA ofﬁcial that falsely stated that FDA had cleared the ELAN-4 Air to be marketed. Stoll later created another, similarly fraudulent letter on FDA letterhead for the SterilContainer JS Series medical device.“Individuals who subvert the FDA clearance process for medical devices put patients’ lives at risk,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Justice Department will work with its law enforcement partners to prosecute individuals who falsify documents and violate the law.”“The FDA’s checks and balances exist for one reason: to protect the public,” said U.S. Attorney Jacqueline C. Romero for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. “One of the medical devices illegally sold in this case is meant to be used in invasive surgeries; the other, to sterilize instruments, preventing infection or contamination. Evading the prescribed FDA clearance process can literally be a matter of life and death, which is why we take these cases so seriously and work to hold perpetrators responsible for their actions.”“The FDA must be notiﬁed and given the opportunity to clear certain medical devices before they are distributed into interstate commerce,” said Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations Justin D. Green of the FDA. “A medical device distributed without FDA clearance can put patients at risk. Our ofﬁce will aggressively pursue those who place patients at risk by failing to follow the law. The FDA’s Ofﬁce of Criminal Investigations (OCI) protects the American public by rigorously investigating allegations involving FDA-regulated products and violations of the FDCA. In this case, OCI worked with the Justice Department to ensure a just resolution, and we applaud the exceptional work done by the team.”FDA’s OCI investigated the case.Trial Attorney Max Goldman and Assistant Director Ross S. Goldstein of the Justice Department’s Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorney and Health Care and Government Fraud Chief Mary Mary Beth Leahy for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania are prosecuting the case.Additional information about the Consumer Protection Branch and its enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch.###"

Montalvo Villa also was convicted of making a false statement to a regulatory investigator with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). On Nov. 30, U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore sentenced Montalvo Villa to 71 months in prison and Portela Martinez to 46 months in prison.According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Montalvo Villa was a co-owner, president and CEO of AMB Research Center Inc. (AMB), a medical clinic located in Miami that conducted clinical trials of new drugs for pharmaceutical companies and sponsors. Portela Martinez was an employee who served as recruiter, site manager, data entry specialist and pharmacist. The evidence showed that Montalvo Villa and Portela Martinez used the names and personal information of individuals without their knowledge or consent and listed them as enrolled subjects in a clinical trial for a drug that was being developed to treat Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), a moderate to severe form of diarrhea. The trial evidence further showed that the defendants enlisted and used the names of family members and friends who purportedly participated as eligible subjects in the CDAD clinical trial – but no subject fully participated in that clinical trial, as required by the protocol.The trial evidence showed that Montalvo Villa and Portela Martinez falsified, at a minimum, hundreds of pages of documents and entered that information and data into the clinical trial’s electronic databases to make it appear as though the purported clinical trial subjects were fully participating in the clinical trial. The trial evidence also showed that as part of the conspiracy, Montalvo Villa submitted falsified and fraudulent invoices for AMB to receive payments for conducting the clinical trial that totaled $277,920.“Accurate clinical trial data is critical to the evaluation of new drug treatments,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M.

Hamdani.Yasser Saleh Ouwad, 52, and his brother - Bilal Saleh Awad, 50, entered their guilty pleas Oct. 12, 2021 and Oct. 30, 2019, respectively, to conspiracy to transport stolen merchandise.U.S. District Judge Randy Crane has now ordered Ouwad to serve 41 months in federal prison to be immediately followed by three years of supervised release. In addition to his prison term, he was ordered to forfeit over $260,000 from bank accounts representing the proceeds of the sale of the stolen merchandise. He must also pay a money judgment entered against him in the amount of $4,665,860 and restitution of $109,742 due to CVS Health and Walgreens.“The shifting predominance to online retailers drives the market for stolen goods at the expense of consumer safety and legitimate merchants,” said Hamdani. “Stolen over the counter medications and health products are often sold for a fraction of the retail price online but can be expired or subject to tampering. These schemes cause millions of dollars in losses to U.S. retailers by hiking up prices and creating an unsafe e-commerce market for consumers.”“The transnational criminal organization these two brothers led was responsible for the theft of more than $30 million in retail goods,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). “Organized retail crime on this scale results in consumers having to pay higher prices and can force businesses to close that provide essential goods and services to the community. HSI Houston will continue to work tirelessly alongside our law enforcement partners to dismantle these organized theft groups and restore order to our communities.”“The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) protects consumers and patients by ensuring the medical products they use, whether they are by prescription or over-the-counter, are safe and effective. Selling stolen medical products puts all consumers’ health at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L. Grinstead, FDA - Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI) Kansas City Field Office. “We will continue to work to protect the health of U.S. consumers and patients.”From June 2015 to March 2018, Ouwad and Awad engaged in high-level fencing operations involving multi-million-dollar, multi-state level criminal organizations. The brothers purchased stolen over-the-counter (OTC) medicine, diabetic test strips and health and beauty supplies for re-packaging and shipping.This criminal enterprise also employed “boosters,” primarily undocumented aliens from Central America, to steal OTC medication from large retailers around the United States. Boosters would then ship the stolen products back to Ouwad and Awad, who resold the stolen merchandise to third parties for a profit.Ouwad owned and operated GPS Wholesale Inc. which he ran from his warehouse in Houston where he would receive the stolen products. Ouwad and his associates would then remove anti-theft stickers and security labels, re-package them into pallets and ship the merchandise to wholesale companies in the New Jersey area.Awad ran a similar operation but would receive stolen merchandise at a CubeSmart Self Storage location in Houston. Awad also removed anti-theft labels and re-packaged the stolen OTC merchandise at his residence before shipping the product to a wholesale company in New York.Ouwad and Awads’ criminal enterprises resulted in over $13 million in losses to retailers between both charged schemes.Awad was previously sentenced on Sept. 5 by U.S. District Judge David Hittner to 41 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release. Additionally, he was ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $322,550 to CVS Health and Walgreens. Awad also had a money judgment of $4,426,942 entered against him representing the illegal proceeds he received during the conspiracy. Awad must also forfeit a bank account with a balance of more than $460,000 and over $6,000 in stolen products law enforcement seized. In handing down the sentence, Judge Hittner noted that Awad managed a sophisticated scheme causing the loss of millions to retailers.Several co-defendants had also pleaded guilty and have received sentences ranging from 18-40 months.Ouwad and Awad were permitted to remain on bond and voluntarily surrender to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future.HSI and FDA – OCI conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Heather Winter and Richard Hanes prosecuted the case.###________________________________________ComponentUSAO - Texas, Southern"

Iwanicki, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office.  “We remain committed to pursuing and bringing to justice those who attempt to subvert the regulatory functions of the FDA by distributing unapproved products.”“This investigation illustrates the dangers of circumventing U.S. regulations with unapproved drugs and chemicals coming from China, where the safety of such chemicals can often not be confirmed,” said Special Agent in Charge (SAC) Robert Hammer, who oversees HSI operations in the Pacific Northwest.  “HSI and our partners are committed to keeping all forms of unapproved products off our streets, especially those that risk public health and safety.”U.S. Attorney Hurwit credited the cooperative efforts of the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, Homeland Security Investigations, and the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security Office of Export Enforcement, which led to the charges.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Darci Crane prosecuted the case.###________________________________________TopicsDRUG TRAFFICKINGHEALTH CARE FRAUDComponentsU.S. Attorneys (USAO)USAO - Idaho"

For instance, Sievert distributed Innotox Medytox and Meditoxin, which contained botulinum toxin type A, a highly potent toxin that could cause the disease botulism. Sievert acquired these products from a Korean pharmaceutical company that did not have the required approvals of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for distribution in the United States. Sievert made fraudulent representations on her BFF website to her customers, such as false and misleading claims that BFF’s products were “FDA approved,” had “cleared customs,” and had “guaranteed authenticity.” Sievert collected online orders from the BFF website and used the United States Postal Service and private and commercial interstate carriers to acquire the unapproved new drugs from foreign pharmaceutical retailers. Sievert then distributed the unapproved new drugs across the United States via the mail.This case was investigated by the United States Food and Drug Administration—Office of Criminal Investigations and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).

Multiple consumers suffered overdoses, including some which were fatal.In addition to imprisonment, Field was also ordered to pay a $250,000 fine. Codefendant Diaz is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 21.“The defendants in this case recklessly endangered the lives and well-being of the numerous individuals who purchased unregulated substances from them,” said U.S. Attorney Jaime Esparza for the Western District of Texas. “We hope that this sentence brings attention this type of conduct and serves as a warning to those who would engage in it.”“Unapproved prescription drugs can present a serious health risk to those who buy and use them.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeMiddle District of FloridaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEMonday, October 23, 2023Fort Myers, Florida – United States District Judge Sheri Polster Chappell has sentenced Brandon Albanito (37, Cape Coral) to 21 years and 10 months in federal prison for possession of a controlled substance (fentanyl) with the intent to distribute it, possessing counterfeit drugs for sale, possessing equipment used to manufacture counterfeit drugs, possessing a firearm as a convicted felon, and bank fraud. The court also ordered Albanito to pay a $500,000 fine, forfeit $97,146 to the United States, and make full restitution to a victim of his bank fraud. Albanito had pleaded guilty in June 2023.According to court documents, in 2016, agents with the Food and Drug Administration—Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI) began investigating a series of packages destined for Cape Coral and North Fort Myers residences that had been intercepted from the mail stream. The packages contained prescription drugs (in bulk powder form, like sildenafil, commonly known as “Viagra”), drug precursors (such as tryptamine, a substance used in the manufacture of hallucinogens), and controlled substances (including methamphetamine). Ultimately, the investigation revealed that each of the addresses was associated in some way with Albanito.To determine how Albanito might be connected to the seized packages, the United States Secret Service (USSS) initiated a financial investigation into Albanito.   Amongst other things, the investigation revealed an array of bank, crypto, and gambling accounts controlled by Albanito. The accounts showed suspicious history of purchases from companies based in China and frequent transfers of money, consistent with money laundering techniques employed by criminals.Additionally, federal investigators linked together other pieces of evidence demonstrating that Albanito was running a large-scale drug manufacturing operation. For instance, in January 2021, Albanito’s former federal cellmate was stopped by the Florida Highway Patrol in Alachua County. The vehicle contained a package of cocaine as well as parts for a pill press (i.e. a machine used to compress materials into a pill form). Ultimately, federal investigators determined that the cocaine and press had been destined for Albanito’s Cape Coral home.In January 2023, the USSS, FDA-OCI, and the Cape Coral Police Department executed a search warrant at Albanito’s home. Almost immediately upon entry, law enforcement found a large, commercial-grade pill press in the garage and hundreds of counterfeit oxycodone pills on a nearby shelf. The counterfeit pills, which appeared identical to prescription oxycodone pills, were found by the FDA to contain fentanyl. Law enforcement also found a found a five-gallon bucket containing more than 40,000 counterfeit Xanax pills (which actually contained the designer drug clonazolam), a five-gallon bucket containing approximately 20 pounds of pill binding agent, pill dies (i.e. tooling used by a pill press to create pills), and two firearms within the residence. DNA testing arranged by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives conducted on the seized firearms demonstrated that Albanito had possessed them, which he was prohibited from doing because he was a convicted felon.Law enforcement also gathered other items and information from his residence demonstrating that, in 2021, Albanito had defrauded an online bank out of nearly $100,000, making lavish purchases with the proceeds, including a luxury vehicle and a luxury watch.This case was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration – Office of Criminal Investigations, the United States Secret Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the Cape Coral Police Department, with assistance from the United States Postal Inspection Service, Homeland Security Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Florida Highway Patrol, and the Pasco Sheriff’s Office. It was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Michael V.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, October 20, 2023SAN DIEGO – Tien Tan Vo, a doctor practicing in Imperial Valley, was sentenced in federal court yesterday for crimes related to his years-long use of foreign unapproved and misbranded cosmetic drugs.  According to his plea and court records, Vo injected as many as 178 patients with unapproved drugs that had been smuggled into the United States from Mexico.Magistrate Judge Allison H. Goddard sentenced Vo to three years of probation and ordered him to pay a $201,534 fine and forfeit the $100,767 in proceeds he made from his use of unlawful cosmetic drugs.  A restitution hearing is set for December 7, 2023, to finalize an order for restitution to potential victims.In August, Vo pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts: receipt of misbranded drugs in interstate commerce and being an accessory after the fact to Flor Cham, who smuggled the unapproved drugs into the United States from Mexico.  Cham is charged in case number 23-cr-01926-JLS.In his plea agreement, Vo admitted that none of the injectable botulinum toxin or lip fillers used by his clinics between November 2016 and October 2020 were approved for use in the United States. This specifically included a botulinum toxin product called “Xeomeen” and an injectable lip filler called Probcel—both products that have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.According to court papers, Vo used these unapproved drugs on approximately 178 patients over about four years.  Many were never told that they received unapproved drugs as part of their treatment.“The public faith in the FDA approval process relies on medical providers adhering to those rules,” said U.S. Attorney Tara McGrath. “By side-stepping the safety and approval protocols of the FDA, Dr. Vo compromised care and put profits before patients. But thanks to the hard work of the agencies and our federal restitution process, those ill-gained profits will be recovered in this case.”“Today’s sentencing serves as our promise to use every tool to investigate and hold accountable those who deliberately smuggle and administer products that pose a significant public health threat,” said Chad Plantz, special agent in charge for HSI San Diego. “HSI, together with the U.S. Attorney’s Office will continue to work together to prosecute those individuals who deceive and threaten our communities.”“The FDA’s requirements help ensure that patients receive safe and effective medical treatments.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeEastern District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, October 19, 2023FRESNO, Calif. — Jia Bei Zhu, aka Jesse Zhu, aka Qiang He, aka David He, 62, a citizen of China who formerly resided in Clovis, was arrested today on a criminal complaint for manufacturing and distributing misbranded medical devices in violation of the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and for making false statements to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert announced.“As part of his scheme, the defendant changed his name, the names of his companies, and their locations,” U.S. Attorney Talbert said. “The disarray at the Reedley lab led to the glare of publicity he was trying to avoid, and the ensuing investigation unraveled his efforts to circumvent the requirements that are designed to ensure that medical devices are safe and effective.”“Providing materially false information to FDA inspectors regarding medical device manufacturing and distribution impedes the agency’s ability to protect public health, especially when those false statements relate to unauthorized and misbranded COVID-19 tests. Consumers who unknowingly use these misbranded COVID tests run the risk of incorrect results about their COVID status, which can lead to further spread of the virus,” said Special Agent in Charge Robert M. Iwanicki, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who jeopardize the health of U.S. consumers.”According to court documents, between December 2020 and March 2023, Zhu and others manufactured, imported, sold, and distributed hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 test kits, in addition to test kits for HIV, pregnancy, clinical urinalysis, and other conditions in the United States and China. They did so through the companies Universal Meditech Incorporated (UMI) and Prestige Biotech Incorporated (PBI), which were based in Fresno and Reedley. UMI and PBI did not obtain the required authorizations to manufacture and distribute the test kits and mislabeled some of the test kits. When questioned by FDA officials, Zhu made false statements about his identity, his ownership and control of UMI and PBI, and the activities of UMI and PBI.According to the criminal complaint, Reedley Code Enforcement officials received a complaint regarding a warehouse in Reedley for using non-permitted plumbing that was visible from outside the warehouse. When code enforcement officials went to the warehouse the next day, they saw various types of in vitro diagnostic test kits, related manufacturing equipment, and shipping supplies.Further investigation found that UMI first registered as a medical device manufacturer with the FDA in November 2015 in Tulare and moved to Fresno in 2018. FDA records show that its registration lapsed in 2022, and it is no longer permitted to manufacture or import any in vitro diagnostic test kits in the United States. Any test kits that the company manufactured or imported after that date are considered misbranded medical devices.To manufacture, import, and distribute COVID-19 test kits in the United States during the pandemic, a company must have applied for, and ultimately received, an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA. According to FDA records, UMI applied for an EUA for its COVID-19 test kits, but never received it due to major deficiencies in UMI’s test studies.In November 2022, Fresno County officials notified UMI that they were going to inspect UMI’s Fresno facility to ensure everything was up to code following a fire that occurred at the facility. FDA officials then received an email from UMI’s attorney saying that the company had gone out of business and sold its assets to PBI, a company that was formed in Las Vegas, Nevada. PBI was never registered with the FDA to manufacture or import any in vitro diagnostic test kits in the United States, and never received an EUA to manufacture and distribute COVID-19 test kits. Therefore, any such test kits would be misbranded medical devices.According to the criminal complaint, during the investigation, Zhu made several false statements to FDA officials, including that his name was Qiang “David” He; that he was hired by UMI as a COVID-19 consultant in 2021; that he was hired by PBI just a couple of weeks ago to communicate with government agencies and dispose of property at the warehouse as requested by those agencies; that he did not know anything about the manufacturing or distribution histories for UMI or PBI; and that he knew nothing about an Amazon webpage showing PBI branded pregnancy test kits for sale or a shipment of 47,500 pregnancy test kits from China to UMI at an address in Las Vegas.This case is the product of an investigation by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the California Department of Public Health – Food and Drug Branch. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Joseph D. Barton, Arelis M. Clemente, and Henry Z. Carbajal III are prosecuting this case.If convicted, Zhu faces a maximum statutory penalty of three years in prison for the misbranding of medical devices charge, and five more years in prison for the false statements charge. Any sentence, however, would be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables. The charges are only allegations; the defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.zhu_criminal_complaint.pdf (1.8 MB)ComponentUSAO - California, Eastern"

Robbins; Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge Robert K. Tripp; Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), Special Agent in Charge of the Oakland Field Office Darren Lian; U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) Pittsburgh Division Inspector in Charge Lesley Allison; and U.S. Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI) Special Agent in Charge of the Metro Washington Field Office George A. Scavdis. The sentence was handed down by the Hon. Charles R. Breyer, Senior United States District Judge.A jury convicted Miller, 58, of Santa Ana, California, and his company, Minnesota Independent Cooperative (MIC), of all charges on January 26, 2023, following a two-week trial.“Miller and his co-conspirators disregarded the health and safety of thousands of people in need of medication,” said First Assistant United States Attorney Patrick D. Robbins. By putting profits over patients, Miller and his criminal enterprise undermined important safeguards designed to ensure the safety of prescription drugs in the United States. This sentence sends the clear message that the diversion of prescription drugs and the intentional circumvention of these critical regulatory requirements will not be tolerated.”“The FDA oversees the prescription drug supply chain; when criminals breach that supply chain, patients can no longer be assured of the safety or effectiveness of the drugs they may take,” said Special Agent in Charge George A. Scavdis, FDA-OCI Metro Washington Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who would put the public health at risk through their criminal actions.”“David Miller greedily put the health and well-being of people at risk with the orchestration and implementation of his prescription drug diversion scheme. He attempted to capitalize on his disregard for people’s health by laundering money around the world,” said Special Agent in Charge Darren Lian, IRS-CI Oakland Field Office. “Let today’s sentencing be a warning to those who aspire to profit from deception against the U.S. government and innocent taxpayers: IRS Criminal Investigation and partner law enforcement agents will catch you and justice will be served.”The trial was the result of indictments filed in two separate districts—the Northern District of California and the Southern District of Ohio. The convictions included charges handed down in a second superseding indictment by a grand jury in the Northern District of California on February 11, 2016, and by a separate indictment handed down on May 6, 2015, in the Southern District of Ohio. Both indictments involved additional defendants and charges that were not presented at the trial.The evidence at trial established that Miller, 58, of Santa Ana, Calif., was at the center of a vast racketeering enterprise responsible for the fraudulent distribution of hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of diverted prescription drugs, including instances in which Miller and his co-conspirators distributed tampered medication that posed a health risk to consumers. The scheme targeted brand-name prescription drugs designed to treat HIV, hepatitis C, mental disorders, and various other serious conditions. Miller and MIC lied to their customers about the nature and sources of the prescription drugs being sold, falsely claiming that the drugs had been maintained in the safe, federally- and state-regulated supply chain. The evidence at trial established that Miller and his company agreed with many others, including Mihran Stepanyan, 37, and Artur Stepanyan, 45, to conduct the affairs of their wide-ranging and long-lasting criminal enterprise. The evidence established that the enterprise, operating primarily out of Southern California and Minnesota, was responsible for distributing diverted prescription drugs to unsuspecting pharmacies throughout the county. In finding Miller guilty, the jury concluded that he played a role in promoting the racketeering conspiracy. For example, as the owner and operator of MIC between 2007 and 2015, Miller bought approximately $157 million of diverted prescription drugs from co-defendants Mihran and Artur Stepanayan. Miller and MIC also knew that the Stepanyans were not licensed to sell prescription drugs and that they procured their drugs from street suppliers. Miller and MIC nevertheless purchased the diverted drugs from the Stepanyans and lied to their customers about the sources and nature of those drugs.Further, the jury concluded Miller engaged in a money laundering conspiracy. The evidence established that Miller and others laundered hundreds of millions of dollars between approximately 2007 and 2015 to promote their criminal activities and to conceal the nature of their scheme. For example, to hide the fact Miller was paying the Stepanyans for the illegally sourced drugs they were distributing, Miller made payments to the Stepanyans’ company GC National Wholesale through companies he controlled in Puerto Rico. As to another supplier, Miller authorized payments to accounts held in the names of various front companies at banks in multiple countries. In this way, Miller and his co-conspirators sought to obscure the illicit sources of MIC drugs and to conceal the true identities of the suppliers.In sum, at the conclusion of the trial, Miller was convicted of one count of racketeering conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d); one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349; one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h); ten counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341; and one count of conspiracy to engage in the unlicensed wholesale distribution of drugs and making a false statement to the FDA, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 331(t), 333(b)(1)(D), 353(e)(2)(A), and 18 U.S.C. § 371.In addition to the prison term, Judge Breyer ordered Miller to pay a $250,000 fine, due immediately; to serve three years of supervised release to begin after the prison term is completed; and to pay a $1,400 special assessment. Judge Breyer also ordered MIC, currently a defunct entity, to pay a special assessment of $4,500.Of the 38 defendants charged in the February 2016 second superseding indictment, all have either been convicted or resolved their case, and six remain to be sentenced.Assistant United States Attorneys Claudia Quiroz, Andrew Dawson, and Chris Kaltsas are prosecuting the case, with the assistance of Paralegal Specialist Kevin Costello. The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the FBI, IRS-Criminal Investigation, U.S. Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, and U.S. Postal Inspection Service.________________________________________ComponentUSAO - California, Northern"

Dolor sold a device known as the SphenoCath, which was intended to treat migraine headaches by administering nerve blocks to the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG), a collection of nerves located in the midface of the skull.As part of his guilty plea, Wright admitted that Dolor did not seek approval or clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to distribute the SphenoCath for this intended use, rendering the SphenoCath devices adulterated and misbranded under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Wright also admitted that, while FDA had recommended in April 2014 that Dolor proceed with investigational studies regarding the SphenoCath’s safety and effectiveness, Dolor never conducted any such study. Instead, Wright and Dolor continued to market the SphenoCath with the intention that it be used to treat migraine headaches by administering SPG nerve blocks. Among other things, Wright provided healthcare providers with marketing materials and unsolicited directions for unapproved use of the SphenoCath.U.S. Magistrate Judge Cecilia M. Romero presided at the plea hearing and set sentencing for Nov. 8.“Patients must be able to trust that they are being treated with medical devices that have been shown to be safe and effective,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department of Justice will continue to take action against companies and individuals that put public health at risk by not complying with the law.”“The United States will continue to prosecute those who flout the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by marketing unapproved, adulterated, and misbranded drugs and devices to the public,” said U.S. Attorney Trina A. Higgins for the District of Utah. “These individuals pose a danger to the community and put the public’s health and safety at risk.”“U.S. consumers rely on the FDA to ensure that their medical devices are safe and effective for their intended uses,” said Special Agent in Charge George M. Scavdis of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who threaten the health of consumers by evading FDA requirements.”The FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations investigated the case.Trial Attorneys David Hixson and Emily C.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeNorthern District of IowaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, October 12, 2023One New Mother Suffered “Horrible and Excruciating Pain”as Her Newborn Went UnfedAn Iowa nurse who stole pain medication from at least 50 new mothers at a Waterloo hospital pled guilty today in federal court in Cedar Rapids. Christina Eileen Olson, formerly known as Christina Eileen Hovey, age 43, of Waterloo, was convicted of one count of acquiring a controlled substance by misrepresentation, fraud, deception, and subterfuge, one count of adulteration and misbranding with intent to defraud and mislead, and one count of false statements relating to health care matters.At the plea hearing, and in a plea agreement, Olson admitted that the State of Iowa granted her a nursing license in 2004. In 2017, a Waterloo hospital hired Olson to work as a nurse in its labor and delivery unit. As a nurse in the hospital’s labor and delivery unit, Olson was responsible for caring for late-term pregnant women, women in active labor, and post-partum women, including womenrecovering from recent Caesarean section (“c-section”) surgery. Obstetricians prescribed these women Schedule II narcotics, including hydromorphone, oxycodone, and fentanyl, to control physical pain associated with the birthing process.From January 2022 to March 25, 2022, Olson used her nursing license to gain access to controlled substances in the hospital’s labor and delivery unit. Instead of administering the controlled substances to the women in pain, Olson diverted the controlled substances to herself for her own illicit drug use. Olson admitted she stole narcotics from no less than 50 victims. To cover up her crimes, Olson used a variety of fraudulent means, including falsely documenting that she had administered pain medication to new mothers when she had not done so.Olson also admitted to tampering with pain medication—replacing fentanyl inside a vial with saline and diverting the narcotic for her own use.For example, on March 25, 2022, Olson was supposed to care for three new mothers and their babies during her shift from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m. One of Olson’s victims, known in court documents as “Mother-1,” had given birth via c-section on March 23, 2022, in a high-risk pregnancy. In addition to caring for Mother-1, it was Olson’s responsibility to come into Mother-1’s room and document how much the baby was eating every hour, as this is important to ensure the health of anewborn. Instead of caring for Mother-1 and her baby, however, Olson never came into the room or checked on Mother-1 or her baby or administered pain medication to Mother-1 on March 25, 2023, even though Olson documented in the hospital’s records that she was administering pain medication to Mother-1. Rather, Olson diverted the pain medication to her own use.As a result of Olson’s crimes, Mother-1 suffered “horrible and excruciating pain” on March 25, 2023. Further, because Olson had created false health care records documenting that she had administered the pain medication to Mother-1, the next nurse on shift declined to give pain medication to Mother-1 for at least 30 additional minutes to ensure Mother-1 was not feigning her need for narcotics. And despite repeated requests by Mother-1’s husband for formula, Mother-1’s newborn did not receive any formula until the end of Olson’s shift.The next day, March 26, 2023, Olson was again working first shift at the hospital. During this shift, the hospital drug-tested Olson. The drug test was positive for opiates (oxycodone and hydromorphone) and marijuana. Another nurse then found an open fentanyl vial, an open ephedrine vial, and an epidural bag in another new mother’s room. The hospital’s records revealed that Olson had removed these three items under the new mother’s name despite the fact there were no such orders for her. The fentanyl vial had puncture marks on the top and bottom stopper surfaces, and laboratory results later revealed that nearly all the fentanyl in the vial had been replaced with saline.Olson admitted that she routinely drank alcohol and used marijuana while working at the Waterloo hospital. In September 2021, after receiving reports that Olson was disappearing from her shift for extended periods of time, the hospital’s director referred Olson to an employee assistance program. On September 9, 2021, however, Olson took a leave of absence from the hospital for about three months after she was arrested for drunk driving. Olson’s blood alcohol level at the time of her arrest was no less than .274.In July 2022, Olson entered into a settlement agreement with the Iowa Board of Nursing under which she agreed to voluntarily surrender her nursing license for one year. As a part of her plea agreement, Olson has agreed to forfeit her nursing license to the United States.Sentencing before United States District Court Judge C.J. Williams will be set after a presentence report is prepared. Olson remains free on bond previously set. Olson faces a possible maximum sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment, a $750,000 fine, and three years of supervised release following any imprisonment.The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Timothy L. Vavricek and was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, and the Iowa Medicaid Fraud Control Unit.Court file information at https://ecf.iand.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/login.pl.The case file number is 23-CR-2055."

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of FloridaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, October 6, 2023MIAMI – A federal judge in Miami has sentenced Jonathan Grenon, 37, and Jordan Grenon, 29, to 151 months in prison, for conspiring to defraud the United States by distributing an unapproved and misbranded drug, and for contempt of court. Mark Grenon, 66, and Joseph Grenon, 36, were sentenced to 60 months in prison, the statutory maximum sentence for conspiring to defraud the United States by distributing an unapproved and misbranded drug. All four defendants were found guilty by a federal jury following a trial this summer.The Grenons, all of Bradenton, Florida, manufactured, promoted, and sold a product they named Miracle Mineral Solution (“MMS”). MMS is a chemical solution containing sodium chlorite and water which, when ingested orally, became chlorine dioxide, a powerful bleach typically used for industrial water treatment or bleaching textiles, pulp, and paper. The Grenons claimed that ingesting MMS could treat, prevent, and cure COVID-19. The FDA, however, had not approved MMS for treatment of COVID-19, or for any other use. Rather, in prior official warning statements, the FDA had strongly urged consumers not to purchase or use MMS for any reason, explaining that drinking MMS was the same as drinking bleach and could cause dangerous side effects, including severe vomiting, diarrhea, and life-threatening low blood pressure. See https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/danger-dont-drink-miracle-mineral-solution-or-similar-products. In fact, FDA received reports of people requiring hospitalizations, developing life-threatening conditions, and even dying after drinking MMS.Before marketing MMS as a cure for COVID-19, the Grenons marketed MMS as a miracle cure-all for dozens of other serious diseases and disorders, such as cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and leukemia, even though the FDA had not approved MMS for any use. The Grenons sold tens of thousands of bottles of MMS nationwide, including to consumers throughout South Florida. They sold this dangerous product under the guise of Genesis II Church of Health and Healing (“Genesis”), an entity they created to avoid government regulation of MMS and shield themselves from prosecution. Genesis’ own websites describe Genesis as a “non-religious church,” and defendant Mark Grenon, the co-founder of Genesis, has repeatedly acknowledged that Genesis “has nothing to do with religion,” and that he founded Genesis to “legalize the use of MMS” and avoid “going [ ] to jail.” The Genesis websites further stated that MMS could be acquired only through a “donation” to Genesis, but the donation amounts for MMS orders were set at specific dollar amounts, and were mandatory, such that the donation amounts were effectively just sales prices. The Grenons received more than $1 million from selling MMS.The federal jury also found defendants Jonathan and Jordan Grenon guilty of criminal contempt of court. The United States previously filed a civil case against the defendants and Genesis II Church of Health and Healing. See United States v. Genesis II Church of Health and Healing, et al., Case No. 20-21601-CV-WILLIAMS. In that civil case, the United States obtained court orders halting the Grenons’ distribution of MMS. The Grenons willfully violated those court orders and continued to distribute MMS. The Grenons also threatened the federal judge presiding over the civil case, and threatened that, should the government attempt to enforce the court orders halting their distribution of MMS, the Grenons would “pick up guns” and instigate “a Waco.”During trial in July 2023, the jury saw photos and video of a dirty rundown shed in Jonathan Grenon’s backyard in Bradenton, Florida, where the defendants were manufacturing their MMS.  These photos showed dozens of blue chemical drums containing nearly 10,000 pounds of sodium chlorite powder, thousands of bottles of MMS, and other items used in the manufacture and distribution of MMS.  The blue chemical drums of sodium chlorite powder—the primary active ingredient in MMS—had warning labels advising the product was toxic, flammable, and highly dangerous to consume.U.S. Attorney Markenzy Lapointe for the Southern District of Florida and Assistant Commissioner Justin D. Green of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI), Miami Field Office, announced the sentence.FDA-OCI Miami investigated the case. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michael B. Homer and John Shipley prosecuted the case.Lapointe commends and thanks the government of Colombia for its assistance. Lapointe also extends his gratitude to the Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs (OIA) and the Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section (NDDS) Judicial Attachés in Bogota, Colombia for their substantial assistance in securing the arrest and extradition of Mark Grenon and Joseph Grenon to the United States.Related court documents and information may be found on the website of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida at www.flsd.uscourts.gov or at http://pacer.flsd.uscourts.gov under case number 21-cr-20242.###________________________________________TopicsCORONAVIRUSCONSUMER PROTECTIONComponentUSAO - Florida, Southern"

Handberg announces that Katherine Jee Rankin (30, Jacksonville Beach) today pleaded guilty to tampering with a consumer product, specifically injectable hydromorphone. Rankin faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in federal prison. A sentencing date has not been set.According to the plea agreement, Rankin was a registered nurse and employed by a surgical center in Jacksonville. On October 13, 2022, after discovering that Rankin had forged an anesthesia record, a supervisor confronted Rankin and told her that she was being fired. After being terminated, but while still in the building, Rankin was seen by another employee, and captured on a surveillance camera, removing some vials from a controlled substances cabinet. While still at the surgical center, Rankin had a discussion with three other employees telling them that she had an addiction and that she had been taking drugs from the facility. She also said that the center’s drug count was going to be off. Rankin eventually turned over four vials of injectable hydromorphone, stating that the vials did not contain hydromorphone, but saline. Rankin explained that she had removed the hydromorphone, replaced it with saline, glued the caps back on, and then put vials back in the inventory so that surgical center’s drug count would be correct.  Laboratory testing later showed that all four vials contained evidence of physical tampering (caps being removed and glued back on) and chemical tampering (each vial contained very diluted amounts of hydromorphone).A review of patient records showed numerous instances in which 200 ml of hydromorphone was documented as being administered to patients when that amount would have been unusual – 100 ml being more typical.  On those occasions, the entries appeared to have been altered with a “2” being written over the “1.”  There were also multiple records of hydromorphone supposedly being administered post-operatively (which also would be unusual), indicating that these records were falsified or altered to cover for Rankin’s diversion of drugs for personal use.As a trained and educated healthcare professional, Rankin knew that tampering with medication and falsifying records placed patients in danger of bodily injury and potentially death.This case was investigated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration – Office of Criminal Investigations and the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office – Pharmaceutical Diversion and Designer Drug Unit attached to the North Florida High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area.

The sentencing took place on September 11, 2023.Lisa Merrigan, age 55, was sentenced to two years of probation and a special assessment to the Federal Crime Victims Fund in the amount of $100.Merrigan was indicted by a federal grand jury in October of 2022. She pleaded guilty on July 5, 2023.The conviction stemmed from incidents between June 19, 2021, and September 11, 2021. Merrigan, worked as a registered nurse at a hospital in Chamberlain, South Dakota, during that time period. Merrigan tampered with a vial of fentanyl citrate for injection properly stored within the hospital, by removing the fentanyl citrate for injection from the vial and replacing the majority of it with saline solution. Merrigan then returned the tampered vial to storage, knowing that the diluted fentanyl citrate for injection could be dispensed to surgical patients at the hospital. Fentanyl citrate is a Schedule II controlled substance that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use to relieve severe pain during and after surgery. The fentanyl in the tampered vial was so diluted that had the vial been dispensed to a surgical patient, the pain management would have been minimal or unsuccessful.This case was investigated by the FDA, Office of Criminal Investigations, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation.

O’Shea, United States Attorney for the Western District of Wisconsin, announced that Dawn Drum, 54, Janesville, Wisconsin, was sentenced today by U.S. District Judge William M. Conley to 15 months in prison, 1 year of supervised release, and fined $30,000 due and payable immediately.  On May 8, 2023, Drum pleaded guilty to one count of product tampering while employed as a Registered Nurse at SSM Health St. Mary’s Hospital in Janesville in November 2021.Drum tampered with vials of fentanyl by withdrawing the drug from the vials and replacing it with saline and then resealing the vial stopper with what appeared to be superglue. Drum then put the tampered vials back into the Pyxis machine, an automated medication dispensing system, so that the tampered fentanyl vials would be available for use with other patients at the hospital.  An audit of the Pyxis transactions in Drum’s name revealed that she had an excessive pattern of fentanyl overrides and wastes when compared to other employees in 2021. When confronted by hospital management in November 2021 with this discrepancy, and asked to take a drug test, Drum refused and instead resigned from her position at the hospital.At today’s sentencing hearing, Drum expressed remorse for her actions and noted that her illegal conduct was driven by her addiction to opioids. She indicated that the harm she caused to her patients by her actions will haunt her for the rest of her life.In imposing sentence, Judge Conley told Drum that he understood that she acted out of character because of her addiction. However, he also noted that her decision to steal fentanyl, and then tamper with the vials and return them to the medication dispenser for use with patients, was the reason he was sentencing her to prison. Judge Conley explained to Drum that her actions harmed others and she needed to face the consequences for those actions.Special Agent in Charge Ronne G. Malham, with the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Chicago Field Office, emphasized the dangers caused by this type of crime, “Health care professionals who tamper with medications from patients not only harm patients but also put at risk the trust that U.S. consumers have in those who provide their medical care. We will continue to investigate and bring to justice health care professionals who tamper with patients’ medications.”The charges against Drum were the result of an investigation conducted by the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, and the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Diversion Control Division.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel J. Graber handled the prosecution of the case.________________________________________TopicOPIOIDSComponentUSAO - Wisconsin, Western"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of FloridaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, September 7, 2023A jury in Miami convicted two defendants on Sept. 5 in a scheme involving the falsification and fabrication of clinical trial data.On Sept. 5, Miguel Angel Montalvo Villa, 53, and Ivette Maria Portela Martinez, 53, both of Miami, were each convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of wire fraud. Montalvo also was convicted of making a false statement to a regulatory investigator with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Previously, on Sept. 13, 2022, Montalvo and Portela were charged in a three-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury. The indictment alleged that, from September 2015 through March 2018, the defendants and a co-conspirator conspired to falsify clinical trial data for profit while working at AMB Research Center Inc. (AMB), a medical clinic located in Miami, Florida.According to court documents and evidence presented during the trial, Montalvo was co-owner, president and chief executive officer of AMB, and Portela was an employee who, among other things, served as AMB’s pharmacist and data entry specialist. Montalvo and Portela used the names of individuals without their knowledge or permission, and listed those individuals as subjects who who were enrolled and participated in a clinical trial for a drug that was being developed to treat Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), a moderate to serious form of diarrhea. None of the listed individuals knew that the defendants were using their personal information to falsely portray them as subjects in the CDAD clinical trial. Montalvo and Portela falsified hundreds of pages of documents and entered that false information into clinical trial databases, to make it appear as though the purported subjects had CDAD and were fully participating in the clinical trial, when in fact they were not.In connection with a February 2018 FDA regulatory inspection of AMB, Montalvo told the FDA regulatory investigator that AMB’s principal investigator had obtained informed consent from all purported CDAD clinical trial subjects, when in fact (and as Montalvo knew) the principal investigator had not done so. As part of the conspiracy, Montalvo also submitted falsified and fraudulent invoices, totaling $277,920.70, in order for AMB to receive payments for conducting the CDAD clinical trial.Sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 30 before the Honorable K. Michael Moore of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Floria.“Truthful clinical trial data is essential to ensuring that new drug treatments are safe and effective,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Justice Department will continue to work with its law enforcement partners to prosecute those who intentionally falsify clinical trial data for personal profit.”“Reliable and accurate data from clinical trials is the cornerstone of FDA’s drug approval process. The jury’s finding demonstrates that those who attempt to subvert the regulatory functions of the FDA by making false statements to the agency will be held accountable for their actions,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin C. Fielder of the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Miami Field Office. “We commend the efforts of the Department of Justice for vigorously pursuing the prosecution of this matter.”FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, Miami Field Office, investigated the case, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of Florida has provided critical assistance.The Justice Department’s Consumer Protection Branch prosecuted the case.Additional information about the Consumer Protection Branch and its enforcement efforts may be found at www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch.

Gorman. Denis Tkachuk, 28, previously worked at hospitals in the Tri-Cities, Seattle, and Olympia and evidence indicates he began stealing and selling medical equipment on eBay as early as 2016. Tkachuk was dismissed from Olympia’s Providence Hospital in September 2019 when hospital staff discovered the theft of hundreds of thermometers, probes, finger sensors and otoscope heads. The equipment from that hospital alone was valued at more than $108,000.“FDA regulates the manufacturing and distribution of medical products like these medical devices to help ensure the safety of American patients,” said Special Agent in Charge Robert M. Iwanicki, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office. “Today’s announcement should serve as a reminder of the FDA’s continued focus on individuals and companies that attempt to profit from risking the health of American consumers.”Tkachuk was a Biomedical Technician and in that capacity was authorized to make purchases of non-capital items worth less than $5,000. In August 2019, a hospital inventory determined a great deal of the equipment Tkachuk purchased was missing and did not appear to have been used at the Olympia hospital or within the Providence healthcare group. The hospital staff made a police report and Tkachuk was fired.The investigation by the Food and Drug Administration Office of the Inspector General revealed that Tkachuk had sold the products primarily to a coconspirator in Detroit, as well as five other buyers. The photos of the equipment that Tkachuk posted for sale on eBay indicated the items were stolen from Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, Kadlec Hospital in Richland and from Providence in Olympia.Describing the harm of the theft, Assistant United States Attorney Hillary Stuart wrote to the court, “These were devices intended for use by patients, physicians, and nurses to treat illness and remedy severe injuries. This offense caused loss to the hospitals, excess work for the individuals responsible for maintaining the stock, and the unavailability of vital medical devices when needed by physicians.”Tkachuk pleaded guilty to wire fraud in May 2023. His Detroit coconspirator was also sentenced to a probationary sentence.Tkachuk was ordered to pay $169,806 in restitution to the hospitals.The case was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration Office of Inspector General with assistance from the Olympia Police Department.The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Hillary Stuart.ContactPress contact for the U.S. Attorney’s Office is Communications Director Emily Langlie at (206) 553-4110 or Emily.Langlie@usdoj.gov.________________________________________TopicHEALTH CARE FRAUDComponentUSAO - Washington, Western"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeWestern District of MichiganFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, September 1, 2023GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN —U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Michigan Mark Totten announced that Colorado resident Brendon Gagne, 27, was sentenced to serve 24 months in prison for conspiring to smuggle unapproved, misbranded prescription drugs into the United States and conspiring to launder the proceeds of that smuggling.U.S. District Judge Robert J. Jonker also ordered Gagne to pay a money judgment of $219,793.98, representing the monies traceable to the smuggling conspiracy, and a fine of $2,000. Upon release from prison, Gagne will be on supervised release for a period of three years.“Smuggling illegal prescription drugs into the United States and distributing them to customers without a prescription is dangerous and potentially deadly,” said U.S. Attorney Mark Totten.  “There is a reason these drugs should only be prescribed by a licensed medical professional. Here, the conspirators operated a vast network distributing these drugs throughout the country, including here in West Michigan. My office is committed to bringing the people who peddle drugs to justice. Today’s sentence of Mr. Gagne is a vital step in ensuring the continued safety of the communities we serve.”The facts presented to the court during the case were that, in 2018, Gagne established www.ExpressPCT.com, a public website that sold unapproved, misbranded prescription drugs and controlled substances to customers without a prescription. The drugs, marketed largely to individuals in the body-building community, were targeted to counteract the side effect of anabolic steroid use. For years, Gagne recruited and worked with others to import the drugs into the United States illegally. The drug packages did not declare their illicit contents and instead took steps to conceal their true nature. For example, conspirators frequently concealed the drugs inside cosmetic boxes and declared on customs forms that the drugs were, instead, “cosmetics” or “gifts.” Customers paid for the drugs either in cryptocurrency or, later, through a payment processing system designed to conceal the amount of money generated by the website and the amount of income earned by Gagne and others. Gagne and the website’s other owners ultimately earned millions of dollars from the scheme, most of which they received in cryptocurrency and then shipped to accounts overseas to avoid law enforcement detection.“Today’s sentencing of Mr. Gagne is another example of the commitment the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and our law enforcement partners have to identifying, disrupting, and arresting those individuals who attempt to distribute illicit drugs, and in this case foreign unapproved drugs, through the U.S. Mail,” said Rodney Hopkins, Inspector in Charge of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service’s Detroit Division. “We will continue to pursue those drug traffickers who distribute potentially dangerous, foreign unapproved prescription drugs and attempt to exploit the distribution channels of the United States Postal Service. I’d like to thank the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, the Michigan State Police, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Michigan for their persistence and dedication in this investigation.”\"Prescription drugs that are smuggled from overseas and are outside the secure supply chain can present a serious health risk to those who use them. The drugs may contain unknown or dangerous ingredients and are manufactured under unknown or unregulated conditions,” said Special Agent in Charge Ronne G. Malham, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Chicago Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who traffic in illegal prescription drugs.”In sentencing Gagne, Judge Jonker noted the serious nature of the crime and the sophisticated nature of the smuggling conspiracy, commenting that he had no doubt that Gagne was a driving force behind the website.Gagne is one of ten defendants who were involved in the scheme to import illegal drugs into the United States. As the creator of the website, Gagne served as a leader in the conspiracy, which Judge Jonker cited as a basis to increase Gagne’s prison sentence. Other defendants sentenced in the scheme include the following:NameHometownSentenceJames FunaroAtlanta, GA15 months in prisonJeremy WalentyTampa, FL3 years of probationTaylor McLarenColorado Springs, CO2 years of probationJoshua FordTroy, MI2 years of probationPhillip LeonowensBoulder, CO2 years of probationRoss LucienLongmont, CO2 years of probationTaylor McLaughlinMuskegon, MI2 years of probationMikaela HallMuskegon, MI2  years of probationThe final defendant in the scheme, Jennifer Garrett of Miami, Florida, is scheduled to plead guilty in the coming weeks.This case was investigated by the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, and the Michigan State Police.

LOUIS, Ill. – A Glen Carbon man who operated an online business admitted guilt in federal court of misbranding the ingredient list on a male sexual enhancement supplement product, thus deceiving his customers.William Goldsmith, 48, pleaded guilty to a felony information Thursday charging one count of introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce.“Protecting consumers is critical to a healthy business environment, and entrepreneurs who use deceitful tactics to sell misbranded products place profits above people,” said U.S. Attorney Rachelle Aud Crowe.“Misbranded prescription drugs that are smuggled from overseas can present a serious health risk to those who buy and use them. The drugs can contain unknown ingredients and can be made under unknown conditions,” said Special Agent in Charge Ronne G. Malham, Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations Chicago Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who traffic in misbranded prescription drugs.”According to court documents, Goldsmith owned and operated an online store called Malosi Herbs from his home in Glen Carbon from 2016 through July 31, 2019.To create inventory, he imported sildenafil citrate from China and India, personally placed a mixture of it into pill capsules, left sildenafil citrate off the bottle’s ingredient label and distributed the misbranded male sexual enhancement product to hundreds of customers across the U.S. The business was estimated to have generated more than $250,000 in gross proceeds.Goldsmith labeled the product: “Ma’Kava,” “Ma’Kava Private Stock,” and “Night Cap X.” The product’s ingredient list claimed to only include “natural” herbal ingredients, such as horny goat weed, black maca, kavalactone, tongkat ali, panax ginseng, ginkgo biloba, and sea cucumber extract. Goldsmith was charged because his products contained sildenafil citrate, and it was not properly listed on the ingredients’ label or any branding of the Ma’Kava products.Sildenafil citrate was an active ingredient in prescription drugs approved by the FDA to treat erectile dysfunction due to its effect on the human body to open capillaries, increase blood flow and speed up a heart rate, according to the criminal complaint.However, the FDA most recently warned consumers of a possible adverse reaction of taking sildenafil citrate for patients using heart or blood-thinning medications—as individuals could have a higher risk of heart attack or stroke.Goldsmith’s sentencing is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. on Dec. 5, 2023.The FDA and USPIS conducted the investigation, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Zoe Gross is prosecuting the case.Individuals who purchased products from Malosi Herbs or Goldsmith between 2016 and July 2019 may be a victim in this case.

This specifically included a botulinum toxin product called “Xeomeen” and an injectable lip filler called Probcel—both products that have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Vo acknowledged that he received $100,767 in gross receipts for almost four years of cosmetic services performed with unapproved drugs and devices.  As part of his plea agreement, he has agreed to forfeit that amount, and to pay a fine of $201,534.  Vo also agreed to pay restitution to victims of his offense.In his plea agreement, Vo admitted purchasing most of his unapproved drugs and devices from the operator of a “med spa” in Mexicali, Mexico, who smuggled them into the United States without declaring them.“All members of our community should be able to trust that their doctor is acting in their best interest,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Andrew Haden. “Through this prosecution, we are protecting patients from unapproved and potentially unsafe drugs and will always seek to thwart those who would exploit patients for financial gain.”“Injecting unapproved medicines poses a significant threat to public health and can have serious consequences for individuals,” said Chad Plantz, Special Agent in Charge for HSI San Diego. “Together, with our partnered agencies, we need to educate people of the dangers caused by using unauthorized botulinum toxin (the active ingredient in Botox®, Xeomin®, and similar products) and thwart those who smuggle and illegally use it for cosmetic procedures.”“The FDA’s requirements help ensure that patients receive safe and effective medical treatments.

These two strike forces add to the three strike forces launched in September 2022 in the Eastern and Central Districts of California, the Southern District of Florida, and the District of Maryland.“The law enforcement actions announced today reflect the Justice Department’s focus – working with our law enforcement partners nationwide – on bringing to justice those who stole from American businesses and families at a time of national emergency,” said Deputy Attorney General Monaco. “The two new Strike Forces launched today will increase our reach as we continue to pursue fraudsters and recover taxpayer funds, no matter how long it takes.”At the meeting, Michael C. Galdo, Acting Director of COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement, detailed the results of the three-month coordinated law enforcement action that took place from May through July 2023, which included criminal, civil, and forfeiture actions. More than 50 U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, including the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Strike Forces, the Justice Department’s Criminal and Civil Divisions, and more than a dozen law enforcement and OIG partners worked together to conduct the sweep.“I applaud the hard work of our prosecutors around the country,” said Acting Director Galdo. “However, this announcement is not a victory lap. Our mission is not complete. We know from our investigative partners that identifying those who committed pandemic relief fraud and recovering stolen funds is difficult work. But the Justice Department, including our strike forces, U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, and the Criminal and Civil Divisions, is committed to using our criminal, civil, and forfeiture tools to hold these fraudsters accountable.”As part of the effort, 718 law enforcement actions occurred, including criminal charges, civil charges, forfeitures, guilty pleas, and sentencings, with a combined total actual loss of more than $836 million. Criminal charges were filed against 371 defendants, and 119 defendants pleaded guilty or were convicted at trial during the sweep. Over $57 million in court-ordered restitution was imposed. 117 civil matters occurred during the sweep, with over $10.4 million in judgments. Prosecutors worked with law enforcement to secure forfeiture of over $231.4 million.As part of the announcement, Acting Director Galdo said that 63 of the defendants had alleged connections to violent crime, including violent gang members also accused of using pandemic funds to pay for a murder for hire. Twenty-five defendants have alleged connections to transnational crime networks.Many of the cases in the enforcement action involve charges related to pandemic unemployment insurance benefit fraud and fraud against the two largest pandemic Small Business Administration programs: the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loans. Additional matters involved pandemic healthcare billing fraud, fraud against the Emergency Rental Assistance program, and fraud committed against the IRS Employee Retention Credit program (ERC), a refundable tax credit for businesses and tax-exempt organizations that had employees and were affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. IRS Criminal Investigations (IRS-CI) worked with the California Strike Force and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey to bring multimillion dollar ERC fraud cases during the enforcement action.In May 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force (CFETF) to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The task force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.The COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Action cases were prosecuted by the following Justice Department entities: Criminal Division’s Fraud Section; Civil Division’s Fraud Section, Consumer Protection Branch; and by the following U.S. Attorneys’ Offices: Northern District of Alabama, Southern District of Alabama, Arizona, Eastern District of California, Central District of California, Northern District of California, Southern District of California, Colorado, Washington, D.C., Delaware, Middle District of Florida, Northern District of Florida, Southern District of Florida, Middle District of Georgia, Northern District of Georgia, Southern District of Georgia, Southern District of Indiana, Idaho, Northern District of Illinois, Northern District of Iowa, Eastern District of Kentucky, Western District of Kentucky, Western District of Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Eastern District of Michigan, Western District of Michigan, Eastern District of Missouri, Western District of Missouri, Northern District of Mississippi, Maine, Montana, Eastern District of North Carolina, Western District of North Carolina, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nevada, Northern District of New York, Northern District of Oklahoma, Northern District of Ohio, Southern District of Ohio, Oregon, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Middle District of Pennsylvania, Western District of Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Eastern District of Texas, Northern District of Texas, Southern District of Texas, Western District of Texas, Eastern District of Virginia, Western District of Virginia, Eastern District of Washington, Western District of Washington, Eastern District of Wisconsin, and Northern District of West Virginia.The cases were investigated by the following agencies: FBI; U.S. Secret Service; IRS-CI; Defense Criminal Investigative Service; Homeland Security Investigations; U.S. Postal Inspection Service; Army Criminal Investigations Division; Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations; the Diplomatic Security Service; and the Offices of Inspectors General from the Small Business Administration, Department of Labor, Department of Homeland Security, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Veterans Affairs, Federal Housing Finance Agency, Federal Reserve Board, Social Security Administration, the Special Inspector General for Pandemic Relief, Treasury, and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.OCDETF Fusion Center and OCDETF’s International Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center, the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and the National Unemployment Insurance Fraud Task Force provided key support.Anyone with information about allegations of attempted fraud involving COVID-19 can report it by calling the Justice Department’s National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF) Hotline at 866-720-5721 or via the NCDF Web Complaint Form at www.justice.gov/disaster-fraud/ncdf-disaster-complaint-form.________________________________________TopicsCORONAVIRUSFINANCIAL FRAUDComponentsOffice of the Attorney GeneralCivil DivisionCriminal DivisionCriminal - Criminal Fraud SectionFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)Office of the Deputy Attorney GeneralUSAO - Alabama, NorthernUSAO - Alabama, SouthernUSAO - ArizonaUSAO - California, CentralUSAO - California, EasternUSAO - California, NorthernUSAO - California, SouthernUSAO - ColoradoUSAO - DelawareUSAO - District of ColumbiaUSAO - Florida, MiddleUSAO - Florida, NorthernUSAO - Florida, SouthernUSAO - Georgia, MiddleUSAO - Georgia, NorthernUSAO - Georgia, SouthernUSAO - IdahoUSAO - Illinois, NorthernUSAO - Indiana, SouthernUSAO - Iowa, NorthernUSAO - Kentucky, EasternUSAO - Kentucky, WesternUSAO - Louisiana, WesternUSAO - MaineUSAO - MarylandUSAO - MassachusettsUSAO - Michigan, EasternUSAO - Michigan, WesternUSAO - Mississippi, NorthernUSAO - Missouri, EasternUSAO - Missouri, WesternUSAO - MontanaUSAO - NevadaUSAO - New HampshireUSAO - New JerseyUSAO - New York, NorthernUSAO - North Carolina, EasternUSAO - North Carolina, WesternUSAO - Ohio, NorthernUSAO - Ohio, SouthernUSAO - Oklahoma, NorthernUSAO - OregonUSAO - Pennsylvania, EasternUSAO - Pennsylvania, MiddleUSAO - Pennsylvania, WesternUSAO - Puerto RicoUSAO - Rhode IslandUSAO - Texas, EasternUSAO - Texas, NorthernUSAO - Texas, SouthernUSAO - Texas, WesternUSAO - Virginia, EasternUSAO - Virginia, WesternUSAO - Washington, EasternUSAO - Washington, WesternUSAO - West Virginia, NorthernUSAO - Wisconsin, EasternPress Release Number:23-906"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of ConnecticutFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, August 23, 2023Vanessa Roberts Avery, United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, today announced that a federal grand jury in New Haven has returned an indictment charging RYAN FIELDS, 49, and LISA MAHAN, 53, of Port Neches, Texas, formerly of Glastonbury, Connecticut, with offenses for illegally selling misbranded and unapproved prescription drugs.The indictment was returned on August 8, 2023, and unsealed after Fields and Mahan were arrested this morning in Port Neches, Texas. They are scheduled to appear this afternoon in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.As alleged in the indictment, from September 2021 to June 2023, Fields and Mahan operated two websites, pinnedaminos.com and projectaminos.com, as well as a private Facebook group called Pinned Aminos, through which they illegally sold and distributed to customers throughout the U.S. misbranded prescription drugs.  They did not require customers to provide a valid prescription, and some of the drugs they sold and distributed were unapproved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human consumption.  The drugs they sold also included drugs they illegally imported from foreign manufacturers.The indictment further alleges that, to avoid detection and mislead the FDA, the pinnedaminos.com website had a disclaimer that falsely stated that the products for sale were “intended for laboratory and research use only,” and “not intended for human ingestion.”  In addition, the labeling on the drugs sold and delivered to customers falsely stated that the drugs were “research compounds” and/or “not for human consumption.”  Contrary to these representations, Fields and Mahan knew and intended that the drugs they sold were for human use, and through emails and posts on the Pinned Aminos Facebook group, they provided customers with information on the health benefits of the drugs they sold and directions on dosage.The indictment alleges that Fields and Mahan unlawfully shipped over 10,000 parcels to customers throughout the country and collected more than $1.4 million from customers.  Fields and Mahan used the proceeds to pay themselves, purchase cars, and purchase a residence in Texas.The indictment charges Fields and Mahan with one count of conspiracy to introduce misbranded or unapproved drugs into interstate commerce and to smuggle goods into the United States, which carries a maximum term of imprisonment of five years, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years.U.S. Attorney Avery stressed that an indictment is not evidence of guilt.  Charges are only allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.This matter is being investigated by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations; the Drug Enforcement Administration; and Homeland Security Investigations.  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Neeraj N. Patel.U.S. Attorney Avery thanked the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Texas for their assistance in this matter.________________________________________TopicsCONSUMER PROTECTIONCYBERCRIMEDRUG TRAFFICKINGPRESCRIPTION DRUGSComponentsUSAO - ConnecticutUSAO - Texas, Eastern"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of New YorkFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, July 26, 2023Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced that defendant JASON SERVIS was sentenced to four years in prison today for his role in a years-long scheme in which horses trained by SERVIS were doped with approved and unapproved drugs designed to improve the performance of SERVIS’s racehorses, in connection with the charges filed in United States v. Navarro et al., 20 Cr. 160 (MKV).  SERVIS was one of over 30 defendants charged in four separate cases in March 2020, each arising from this Office’s multi-year investigation of the abuse of racehorses through the use of performance enhancing drugs (“PEDs”).U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Today’s sentence sends a clear signal to those in the racehorse industry that no one is above the law.  Endangering the welfare of animals for profit will not be tolerated.  Illegally doping racehorses is a serious crime that will be met with a serious sentence.”According to the allegations contained in the Superseding Indictment, the Superseding Information charging SERVIS, prior charging instruments, other filings in this case, and statements during court proceedings:The charges in the Navarro case arose from an investigation of widespread schemes by racehorse trainers, veterinarians, PED distributors, and others to manufacture, distribute, and receive adulterated and misbranded PEDs and to secretly administer those PEDs to racehorses competing at all levels of professional horseracing.  By evading PED prohibitions and deceiving regulators and horse racing officials, participants in these schemes sought to improve race performance and obtain prize money from racetracks throughout the United States and other countries, including in New York, New Jersey, Florida, Kentucky, and Saudi Arabia, all to the detriment and risk of the health and well-being of the racehorses.  Trainers who participated in the schemes, like SERVIS, stood to profit from the success of racehorses under their control by earning a share of their horses’ winnings and by improving their horses’ racing records, thereby yielding higher trainer fees and increasing the number of racehorses under their control.SERVIS obtained hundreds of bottles of the drug “SGF-1000,” which was compounded and manufactured in unregistered facilities and contained growth factors that the defendant believed to be undetectable through regular drug screens.  Virtually all the horses in SERVIS’s barn received that drug, including the thoroughbred racehorse “Maximum Security,” who crossed the finish line first at the 2019 Kentucky Derby.  SGF-1000 was an intravenous drug promoted as, among other things, a vasodilator capable of promoting stamina, endurance, and lower heart rates in horses through the purported action of “growth factors.”  SERVIS approved veterinary bills to racehorse owners that contained concealed charges for SGF-1000, which were falsely billed under the line item “Acupuncture & Chiropractic.”  In September 2019, the New York State Gaming Commission released an advisory stating that SGF-1000 was prohibited under the racing rules and had been prohibited since 2012.  SERVIS continued to allow the administration of that drug on the horses he trained up until his arrest in March 2020.SERVIS-trained horses were also regularly administered the prescription drug “Clenbuterol” with no valid prescription, which was part of a deliberate effort to conceal that conduct from racing regulators and avoid mandatory reporting requirements.SERVIS further obtained and transported a misbranded version of “Clenbuterol,” which he obtained from convicted co-defendant JORGE NAVARRO.*                *                *In addition to the prison term, SERVIS, 65, of Jupiter, Florida, was sentenced to one year of supervised release and ordered to pay $311,760 in forfeiture, $163,932 in restitution, and a $30,000 fine.Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation New York Field Office’s Eurasian Organized Crime Task Force and its support of the Bureau’s Integrity in Sports and Gaming Initiative.  Mr. Williams also thanked the Food and Drug Administration and Customs and Border Protection for their assistance and expertise.This case is being handled by the Office’s Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Sarah Mortazavi is in charge of the prosecution.ContactNicholas Biase(212) 637-2600________________________________________ComponentUSAO - New York, SouthernPress Release Number: 23-266"

In May, Vega pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to traffic misbranded and adulterated drugs in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 670.The prescription medication diversion fraud scheme involved a division of labor, in which street-level dealers obtained the medicines and supplied them to participants who inspected, cleaned, and packaged the drugs for shipment to others with established pharmaceutical wholesale companies.The wholesale company owners prepared fraudulent documentation, falsely representing that legitimate drug manufacturers had provided the medications to them. In fact, the suppliers had acquired the drugs through health care fraud, theft or burglary, or by buying the medications from patients who obtained prescriptions but chose to sell them rather than take their medicines. With the false documentation, the company owners then sold the newly misbranded medications to retail pharmacies. In turn, the retail pharmacies sold the medications to patients who did not know the real source of the drugs, which had been stored and transported with no regard to temperature, light, humidity, or other maintenance controls.To conceal the nature of their criminal enterprise and the identities of those profiting from it, conspirators routed money obtained from sales of the mislabeled and adulterated drugs through the bank accounts of multiple shell companies.To date, 17 defendants have been indicted in connection with this case, 15 of whom have pleaded guilty and been sentenced to prison, except for a corporation defendant, which was sentenced to a forfeiture of $78 million.U.S. Attorney Markenzy Lapointe for the Southern District of Florida; Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey B.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of FloridaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, July 21, 2023MIAMI – A federal jury in Miami has found Mark Grenon, 65, and his three sons, Jonathan Grenon, 38, Jordan Grenon, 29, and Joseph Grenon, 36, guilty of conspiracy to defraud the United States by distributing an unapproved and misbranded drug.  Jonathan and Jordan Grenon were also found guilty of contempt of court.The Grenons, all of Bradenton, Florida, manufactured, promoted, and sold a product they named Miracle Mineral Solution (“MMS”). MMS is a chemical solution containing sodium chlorite and water which, when ingested orally, became chlorine dioxide, a powerful bleach typically used for industrial water treatment or bleaching textiles, pulp, and paper. The Grenons claimed that ingesting MMS could treat, prevent, and cure COVID-19. The FDA, however, had not approved MMS for treatment of COVID-19, or for any other use. Rather, in prior official warning statements, the FDA had strongly urged consumers not to purchase or use MMS for any reason, explaining that drinking MMS was the same as drinking bleach and could cause dangerous side effects, including severe vomiting, diarrhea, and life-threatening low blood pressure. See https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/danger-dont-drink-miracle-mineral-solution-or-similar-products. In fact, FDA received reports of people requiring hospitalizations, developing life-threatening conditions, and even dying after drinking MMS.Before marketing MMS as a cure for COVID-19, the Grenons marketed MMS as a miracle cure-all for dozens of other serious diseases and disorders, such as cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and leukemia, even though the FDA had not approved MMS for any use. The Grenons sold tens of thousands of bottles of MMS nationwide, including to consumers throughout South Florida. They sold this dangerous product under the guise of Genesis II Church of Health and Healing (“Genesis”), an entity they created to avoid government regulation of MMS and shield themselves from prosecution. Genesis’ own websites describe Genesis as a “non-religious church,” and defendant Mark Grenon, the co-founder of Genesis, has repeatedly acknowledged that Genesis “has nothing to do with religion,” and that he founded Genesis to “legalize the use of MMS” and avoid “going [ ] to jail.” The Genesis websites further stated that MMS could be acquired only through a “donation” to Genesis, but the donation amounts for MMS orders were set at specific dollar amounts, and were mandatory, such that the donation amounts were effectively just sales prices. The Grenons received more than $1 million from selling MMS.The federal jury also found defendants Jonathan and Jordan Grenon guilty of criminal contempt of court. The United States previously filed a civil case against the defendants and Genesis II Church of Health and Healing. See United States v. Genesis II Church of Health and Healing, et al., Case No. 20-21601-CV-WILLIAMS. In that civil case, the United States obtained court orders halting the Grenons’ distribution of MMS. The Grenons willfully violated those court orders and continued to distribute MMS. The Grenons also threatened the federal judge presiding over the civil case, and threatened that, should the government attempt to enforce the court orders halting their distribution of MMS, the Grenons would “pick up guns” and instigate “a Waco.”During trial, the jury saw photos and video of a dirty rundown shed in Jonathan Grenon’s backyard in Bradenton, Florida, where the defendants were manufacturing their MMS. These photos showed dozens of blue chemical drums containing nearly 10,000 pounds of sodium chlorite powder, thousands of bottles of MMS, and other items used in the manufacture and distribution of MMS. The blue chemical drums of sodium chlorite powder—the primary active ingredient in MMS—had warning labels advising the product was toxic, flammable, and highly dangerous to consume.Sentencing has been scheduled for October 6. At sentencing, the defendants face up to 5 years in prison.U.S. Attorney Markenzy Lapointe for the Southern District of Florida and Assistant Commissioner Justine Green of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations announced the conviction.FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations investigated the case. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michael B. Homer and John Shipley of the Southern District of Florida are prosecuting it.U.S. Attorney Lapointe commends and thanks the government of Colombia for its assistance. U.S. Attorney Lapointe also extends his gratitude to the Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs (OIA) and the Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section (NDDS) Judicial Attachés in Bogota, Colombia for their substantial assistance in securing the arrest and extradition of Mark Grenon to the United States.Related court documents and information may be found on the website of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida at www.flsd.uscourts.gov or at http://pacer.flsd.uscourts.gov under case number 21-cr-20242.###ContactPublic Affairs UnitU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of FloridaTopicsCORONAVIRUSCONSUMER PROTECTIONFINANCIAL FRAUDComponentUSAO - Florida, Southern"

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, July 20, 2022A Philadelphia-area man pleaded guilty today for his role in distributing medical devices without U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance, the Department of Justice announced.Peter Stoll III, 34, pleaded guilty to one felony count of violating the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) by causing the introduction of misbranded and adulterated medical devices into interstate commerce, in violation of 21 United States Code, Section 331(a) and 331(a)(2).According to court documents, Stoll was a regulatory affairs specialist at a medical device manufacturer located in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and was responsible for making submissions to the FDA that were required before the company could sell its medical devices. In pleading guilty, Stoll admitted that in 2017 he created two false letters that purported to show that FDA had granted clearance to sell two different medical devices. As a result, the company illegally sold tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of medical devices throughout the United States.Stoll was responsible for shepherding two of the company’s devices through the FDA’s 510(k) clearance process: the ELAN-4 Air Drill, a high-speed surgical drill used for bone cutting, sawing, and drilling, and the JS Series SterilContainer S2, a reusable sterilization container for medical instruments. Stoll admitted that he never submitted any 510(k) documents to FDA regarding either device. Instead, Stoll created a fraudulent letter using FDA letterhead and bearing the forged digital signature of an FDA official that falsely stated that FDA had cleared the ELAN-4 Air to be marketed. Stoll later created another, similarly fraudulent letter on FDA letterhead for the SterilContainer JS Series medical device.“Subverting the FDA clearance process for medical devices can put patients’ lives at risk,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department of Justice will work with its law enforcement partners to prosecute anyone who ignores their obligations regarding consumer safety.”“FDA must be notified and given the opportunity to clear certain medical devices before they are distributed into interstate commerce,” said Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations Justin D. Green of the FDA. “Not obtaining this required clearance is bad enough, but impersonating FDA to cover up this failure is truly egregious and puts patients at risk. The FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI) protects the American public by aggressively investigating allegations involving FDA-regulated products and violations of the FDCA. In this case, OCI worked with the Justice Department to ensure a just resolution, and we applaud the exceptional work done by the team.”Stoll pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Edward G. Smith. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 7. He faces a maximum penalty of three years’ in prison, a one-year period of supervised release, a $250,000 fine and $100 special assessment.FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations investigated the case.Trial Attorney Max J. Goldman and Assistant Director Ross S. Goldstein of the Justice Department’s Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorney M.

On these markets, the co-conspirators advertised various controlled substances, including crystal methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl-laced counterfeit pills that the conspirators advertised as oxycodone. During the course of the conspiracy, the conspirators made over 1,300 sales of controlled substances over the darknet using these accounts, distributing at least 800 grams of counterfeit pills containing fentanyl, 500 grams of methamphetamine, 16 grams of heroin, and 7 grams of cocaine. The conspirators described the pressed pills containing fentanyl on one marketplace as “Not normal OxyCodone”, informing potential customers “These are MUCH stronger than pharmaceutical OxyCodone… These were NOT made by a pharmacy,” and warning customers to “BE CAREFUL.” Dittman worked primarily with Schiffner to process orders over the darknet and then package and ship them. Dittman also operated her own vendor accounts on the darknet using the monikers “VirtualPeddler” and “Darkette”. By the time of her arrest, she had made at least 74 sales of controlled substances through those accounts, the majority of which were fentanyl.The darknet, also called the darkweb, is a portion of the Internet that hosts darknet markets, or hidden commercial websites. A darknet market operates as a black market, selling or brokering transactions involving legal products, as well as drugs, weapons, counterfeit currency, stolen credit card details, forged documents, unlicensed pharmaceuticals, steroids, and other illicit goods.Co-conspirators Schiffner was sentenced on April 14, 2023, to 150 months imprisonment.

Smith III, 47, of Shawnee, Kansas, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Howard F. Sachs to two years in federal prison without parole. The court also ordered Smith to pay $18,296 in restitution to his victims.On July 27, 2022, Smith pleaded guilty to one count of receiving misbranded drugs (foreign and unapproved Botox) and delivering them for pay with the intent to defraud or mislead, and one count of receiving adulterated devices (Juvederm Ultra 3) and delivering them for pay with the intent to defraud or mislead.Smith owned and operated Tap and Blade, located at 7208 Wornall Road, Suite 206, in Kansas City, Mo. Tap and Blade offered medical services, such as injections of prescription drugs, including Botox, and prescription devices to enhance facial features, including Juvederm Ultra 3. Tap and Blade also offered cosmetic services, such as microblading, brow shading, and cool sculpting. Smith was the only employee of Tap and Blade and performed all the procedures offered at the clinic.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations began investigating Tap and Blade in December 2020 based on information that multiple patients suffered injuries after receiving treatment at Tap and Blade. Agents executed a search warrant at Tap and Blade on April 7, 2021, and found boxes of Juvederm Ultra 3 as well as three syringes filled with Botox.Smith admitted that he obtained Botox and Juvederm Ultra 3 over the internet and without a prescription from a website in China. Smith purchased the products from Alibaba.com because the foreign products were significantly cheaper, which allowed him to lower his cost compared to his competitors and led him to gain more customers. Smith knew the drugs and devices he was injecting into his patients were illegal.Smith admitted he never told his patients he was using foreign prescription drugs and devices that had not been approved by the FDA. Smith estimated he treated approximately 50 to 60 customers. Smith treated at least 10 patients who suffered a bodily injury after being treated with Juvederm Ultra 3.For example, according to court documents, one patient told investigators the treatment was very painful and bruised her lip immediately. She went to the emergency room due to severe pain and blistering on her upper lip and was treated by a plastic surgeon. Another patient told investigators she has a permanent scar as a result of Smith’s treatments.Even after Smith became aware of patients suffering adverse reactions to his procedures, he continued to perform injections in the same manner using the same types of illegal products.During the more than three years Tap and Blade operated, from Jan. 1, 2018, to April 30, 2021, there was never a medical doctor associated with the spa, nor was there a doctor overseeing procedures. Smith admitted that he knew his patients should have seen a doctor prior to receiving treatment, and that he told them there was a doctor on staff. Smith persistently misrepresented his qualifications to patients. He told patients he was a registered nurse or had a nursing degree, and that he was licensed to perform the procedures. These lies allowed him to gain the trust of his clients, which enabled him to commit these crimes that ultimately led to several individuals suffering an injury.Smith did not attend any training courses on how to properly administer the products. Prior to opening Tap and Blade, Smith practiced injections on honeydew fruit, fake heads, and fake skins.The FDA approval of Botox limits the drug to use under the supervision of a licensed practitioner, thus, it is a prescription drug. Smith admitted that the foreign and unapproved Botox he purchased for use at his spa was misbranded because it did not bear adequate directions for use.Upon being injected beneath the skin’s surface, Juvederm adds volume and lift to smooth wrinkles and folds. Juvederm products are regulated as devices because, when injected, they are intended to reside under the skin and do not achieve their primary intended purpose through chemical action or metabolization. The FDA’s approval for Juvederm products limits them to use under the supervision of a licensed practitioner, thus, they are prescription devices. Juvederm Ultra 3 is not legal for distribution in the United States because it lacks FDA approval.Smith was convicted in 2011 of one count of attempted possession of gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) with intent to manufacture gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and three counts of possession of GBL with intent to manufacture GHB. He was sentenced to five years in federal prison without parole. During the investigation of that case, it was determined that Smith, acting as a representative of Schindler Elevator, purchased four 30-gallon drums of GBL from Barton Solvents, Inc. in Kansas City, Kan., between Oct. 5, 2006, and Dec. 3, 2007. Smith falsely claimed the GBL would be used for cleaning and degreasing purposes, when in reality, Smith obtained the GBL with the intent of converting it to GHB. On Oct. 8, 2007, a woman who lived with and dated Smith died from a drug overdose. GHB was one drug found in her system. The amount of GHB in her system was considered a lethal level of GHB and likely led to her death.This case was prosecuted by Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Bradley Cooper. It was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigation.________________________________________ComponentUSAO - Missouri, Western"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeNorthern District of IllinoisFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, June 30, 2023CHICAGO — The owner of a suburban Chicago medical supply company has been convicted of price gouging customers who sought to purchase scarce N-95 masks amid the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.KRIKOR TOPOUZIAN, 62, of Winnetka, Ill., was convicted Thursday after a bench trial before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeffrey Cole of violating the Defense Production Act.  The conviction is punishable by up to one year in federal prison.  Sentencing is set for Oct. 10, 2023, at 10:00 a.m.Evidence at trial in federal court in Chicago showed that Topouzian was the owner and president of Concord Health Supply in Skokie, Ill.  Topouzian in March and April of 2020 accumulated approximately 79,160 respirator masks, including N-95 masks, for a mean price of approximately $5.08 per mask.  These types of masks had been designated by the President of the United States under the Defense Production Act as “scarce materials” due to the then-ongoing pandemic. Topouzian later sold the masks in excess of prevailing market prices for as high as $19.95 per mask – a markup of approximately 185% to 367% per mask.  Topouzian engaged in the price gouging despite repeated warnings, including from law enforcement, about the illegal nature of his conduct.As part of the guilty verdict, the Court issued written Findings of Fact.  The Court found that during the earliest days of the pandemic, Topouzian “was told by friends and customers on at least six separate occasions that the prices at which he was selling N-95 masks were too high.”  In response to one such warning, Topouzian responded, “Who is going to report me?. . .  I’ve already been threatened by so many people that they’re going to call the FBI.”  At one point, to offset negative online reviews about his company that included accusations of price gouging, Topouzian asked a relative to recruit friends to write fictitious online reviews complimentary of Topouzian’s company.The Court also found that, as Topouzian continued to sell the scarce masks in excess of prevailing market prices, he boasted about “how much he was making and how cheap the masks were to buy and that he was making massive profits.”  In a text message cited in the Court’s Findings of Fact, Topouzian stated, “You can’t imagine my business. $50-80,000 a day, I did $1 million in the last couple weeks.”The conviction was announced by Morris Pasqual, Acting United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, and Robert W. “Wes” Wheeler, Jr., Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Field Office of the FBI.  Valuable assistance was provided by the Illinois Attorney General’s Office, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations.  The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michelle Petersen and Peter M. Flanagan.During the Covid-19 pandemic, the Department of Justice created the COVID-19 Hoarding and Price Gouging Task Force to investigate and prosecute illegal activity involving protective personal equipment.  Anyone wishing to report Covid-19 fraud, hoarding, or price-gouging can do so by contacting the National Center for Disaster Fraud’s National Hotline via phone: (866) 720-5721, or e-mail: disaster@leo.gov.________________________________________TopicsCORONAVIRUSCONSUMER PROTECTIONCYBERCRIMEDISASTER FRAUDComponentsFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)USAO - Illinois, Northern"

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, June 28, 2023The Justice Department, together with federal and state law enforcement partners, announced today a strategically coordinated, two-week nationwide law enforcement action that resulted in criminal charges against 78 defendants for their alleged participation in health care fraud and opioid abuse schemes that included over $2.5 billion in alleged fraud.The defendants allegedly defrauded programs entrusted for the care of the elderly and disabled, and, in some cases, used the proceeds of the schemes to purchase luxury items, including exotic automobiles, jewelry, and yachts. In connection with the enforcement action, the Department seized or restrained millions of dollars in cash, automobiles, and real estate.“These enforcement actions, including against one of the largest health care fraud schemes ever prosecuted by the Justice Department, represent our intensified efforts to combat fraud and prosecute the individuals who profit from it,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “The Justice Department will find and bring to justice criminals who seek to defraud Americans and steal from taxpayer-funded programs.”“This nationwide enforcement action demonstrates that the Criminal Division is committed to fighting health care fraud and opioid abuse by prosecuting those who allegedly exploit patients and health care benefit programs for personal gain,” said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Today’s announcement includes some of the largest and most complex cases that the Department has prosecuted, and demonstrates the Department’s commitment to seeking justice for those at all levels of the healthcare industry who put profits above patient care, from professionals in doctors’ offices to executives in corporate boardrooms.”“Health care fraud is a complex and ever-evolving threat that negatively impacts the American people,” said Assistant Director Luis Quesada of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division. “Today’s nationwide coordinated law enforcement action is a testament to the tenacity of the FBI and our partners, as well as our combined efforts to pursue anyone who conspires to exploit our health care system for financial gain.”“Patients trust federal health care programs to provide high quality care. When bad actors steal from these programs, they hurt patients,” said Inspector General Christi A. Grimm of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “HHS-OIG is dedicated to protecting federal health care programs and putting patients first. Thank you to our law enforcement partners, especially the Medicaid Fraud Control Units, that participated in this effort.”“At the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), we are committed to protecting the safety and health of all Americans,” said DEA Administrator Anne Milgram. “When individuals divert addictive opioid medications for personal gain, they are knowingly putting Americans at risk, all too often causing harm and even death. DEA is committed to taking decisive action to hold accountable anyone who participates in these dangerous schemes.”“The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) provides community health care to family members of our nation’s disabled or deceased veterans, and the defendants’ alleged criminal actions resulted in a multibillion-dollar fraud scheme that puts those benefits at risk and pilfers significant taxpayer funds,” said Inspector General Michael J. Missal of the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General (VA-OIG). “The VA-OIG’s continued oversight of VA’s multiple healthcare programs, including CHAMPVA, is one of the agency’s highest priorities. We thank our outstanding law enforcement partners for their efforts in this investigation.”Telemedicine FraudThe enforcement action included charges against 11 defendants in connection with the submission of over $2 billion in fraudulent claims resulting from telemedicine schemes. In a case involving the alleged organizers of one of the largest health care fraud schemes ever prosecuted, an indictment in the Southern District of Florida alleges that the chief executive officer (CEO), former CEO, and Vice President of Business Development of purported software and services companies conspired to generate and sell templated doctors’ orders for orthotic braces and pain creams in exchange for kickbacks and bribes. The conspiracy allegedly resulted in the submission of $1.9 billion in false and fraudulent claims to Medicare and other government insurers for orthotic braces, prescription skin creams, and other items that were medically unnecessary and ineligible for Medicare reimbursement.As part of the alleged conspiracy, individuals in a massive telemarketing operation, located in the United States and abroad, targeted the elderly and disabled with direct mail, television advertisements, and other forms of advertising to induce them to contact offshore boiler-rooms staffed by individuals who “up-sold” the elderly and disabled on unnecessary medical equipment and prescriptions. According to the indictment, the software platform that the defendants allegedly operated was actually a conduit for these telemarketers to coordinate the payment of illegal kickbacks and bribes to telemedicine companies to obtain doctors’ orders for Medicare beneficiaries. The defendants allegedly programmed the software platform to generate false and fraudulent orders for telemedicine practitioners to sign and obstruct Medicare investigations by concealing that the interactions with beneficiaries had occurred remotely using telemedicine. The program-generated orders falsified certifications that the telemedicine doctors had examined the beneficiaries in person, and falsified diagnostic testing that Medicare required for brace orders. After the original CEO sold the company in a corporate acquisition, the new corporate leadership allegedly chose to continue the pre-existing fraud scheme.In another telemedicine fraud case, in the Eastern District of Washington, a licensed physician was charged for signing more than 2800 fraudulent orders for orthotic braces, including for patients whose limbs had already been amputated. As alleged, the physician took less than 40 seconds to review and sign each order.The cases announced today build on earlier telemedicine enforcement actions involving over $10.1 billion in fraud. The April 2019 Operation Brace Yourself Telemedicine and Durable Medical Equipment Takedown alone resulted in an estimated cost avoidance of more than $1.9 billion in the amount Medicare paid for orthotic braces in the 20 months following that enforcement action, preserving the Medicare trust fund for necessary medical care.Pharmaceutical FraudThe enforcement action also included charges against 10 defendants in connection with the submission of over $370 million in fraudulent claims submitted in connection with prescription drugs. In one case announced today, the owner and corporate officer of a pharmaceutical wholesale distribution company was charged for an alleged $150 million fraud scheme in which the company purchased illegally diverted prescription HIV medication, and then marketed and resold the medication by falsely representing that the company acquired it through legitimate channels. The defendant allegedly purchased the diverted medication at a substantial discount from individuals who obtained the drugs primarily through illegal “buyback” schemes in which they paid HIV patients cash for their expensive HIV medication and repackaged those pills for resale. To cover up their scheme, the defendant and others falsified labeling and product tracing documentation to make it appear legitimate. Pharmacies purchased the misbranded medications, dispensed them to patients, and billed them to health care benefit programs, all while the defendants reaped substantial illegal profits.In a related case, on June 15, an individual in the Southern District of Florida was sentenced to 15 years in prison for his role in this nationwide scheme. According to court documents, the defendant illegally acquired large quantities of prescription drugs from patients for whom the drugs had been prescribed but not yet consumed. The defendant and others then repackaged the drugs and sold them to wholesale companies. In some instances, the medication that the defendant sold contained the wrong medication, broken pills, and even pebbles, leading to complaints by pharmacies. The defendant used his share of the proceeds to purchase luxury goods, including a $280,000 Lamborghini, a $220,000 Mercedes, and three boats.Opioid Distribution and Other Types of Health Care FraudThe charges also targeted over $150 million in false billings submitted in connection with other types of health care fraud, including the illegal distribution of opioids and clinical laboratory testing fraud. Today’s enforcement action includes charges against 24 physicians and other licensed medical professionals who lined their own pockets, including doctors who allegedly put their patients at risk by illegally providing them with opioids they did not need. The charges also include cases where healthcare companies, physicians, and other providers paid cash kickbacks to patient recruiters and beneficiaries in return for patient information, so that the providers could submit fraudulent bills for Medicare reimbursement.The Center for Program Integrity of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CPI/CMS) separately announced today that it took adverse administrative actions in the last six months against 90 medical providers for their alleged involvement in health care fraud.Principal Assistant Deputy Chief Jacob Foster and Acting Assistant Chief Rebecca Yuan of the National Rapid Response Strike Force of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section led and coordinated today’s enforcement action. The Health Care Fraud Unit’s Strike Forces in Brooklyn, Dallas, Detroit, the Gulf Coast, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Newark, and Tampa; the Health Care Fraud Unit’s National Rapid Response Strike Force; the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices for the Middle District of Florida, Southern District of Florida, Southern District of Georgia, District of Idaho, Western District of Kentucky, Eastern District of Louisiana, Middle District of Louisiana, District of New Jersey, Eastern District of New York, Southern District of Ohio, District of South Carolina, Southern District of Texas, Eastern District of Washington, and Eastern District of Wisconsin; and the State Attorney Generals’ Offices for Indiana, New York, and Pennsylvania are prosecuting these cases, with assistance from the Health Care Fraud Unit’s Data Analytics Team. Descriptions of cases involved in today’s enforcement action are available on the Department’s website at www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/health-care-fraud-unit/2023-national-hcf-court-documents.In addition to the FBI, HHS-OIG, DEA, and CMS/CPI, State Medicaid Fraud Control Units, HSI, FDA, IRS-CI, VA-OIG, USPS-OIG, FDIC-OIG, OPM-OIG, Amtrak-OIG, and other federal and state law enforcement agencies participated in the operation.The Fraud Section leads the Criminal Division’s efforts to combat health care fraud through the Health Care Fraud Strike Force Program. Since March 2007, this program, comprised of 15 strike forces operating in 25 federal districts, has charged more than 5,000 defendants who collectively have billed federal health care programs and private insurers more than $24 billion. More information can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/health-care-fraud-unit.The Fraud Section uses the Victim Notification System to provide victims with case information and updates related to this case.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of FloridaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEMonday, June 26, 2023BOSTON – A former DePuy Synthes sales representative and team lead was arrested today for allegedly defrauding a Boston area hospital and lied to federal authorities investigating his interference with the hospital’s sterilization processes.Matthew Capobianco, 45, of Winchester, Mass., was indicted on eight counts of wire fraud and one count of making material false statements. Capobianco was arrested today and, following an initial appearance and arraignment in federal court in Boston this afternoon, was released on conditions.According to the indictment, from January 2016 through June 2017, Capobianco defrauded a Boston area hospital out of hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of spine products that he falsely represented were used in spine surgeries he covered. As a sales representative at DePuy, Capobianco was present in operating rooms at the hospital during spine surgeries dressed in scrubs and a surgical mask. In that role, Capobianco was responsible for tracking the type and quantity of DePuy products used in the spine surgeries on usage forms that he submitted to the hospital’s billing department, among other things. It is alleged that Capobianco’s compensation was tied to the volume of products that surgeons at the hospital and elsewhere used in their surgeries. To boost his sales numbers, increase his compensation, and attain higher rankings within DePuy’s sales organization, Capobianco falsely represented on usage forms that more—and more expensive—DePuy products were used during the spine surgeries than were actually used. Capobianco’s alleged fraudulent overbilling caused the hospital to pay DePuy for products that were not used in spine surgeries and caused DePuy, in turn, to pay Capobianco commissions that he was not entitled to.It is further alleged that, in late 2016, Capobianco instructed a subordinate DePuy sales representative to bring certain DePuy spinal implants into an operating room at the hospital for a surgery, without those implants first being sterilized. As Capobianco and his sales colleagues understood, using unsterile implants in a spine surgery could lead to serious infection or death. It is alleged that on May 30, 2017, after this 2016 incident, Capobianco himself brought DePuy spinal implants that were not in compliance with the hospital’s sterilization policies to an operating room at the Boston area hospital. Concerned about the dangers posed by unsterile implants, hospital employees confiscated the spinal implants to ensure they were not used in a scheduled surgery that day, and Capobianco was banned from the hospital that afternoon. During a subsequent interview with federal agents that day about the sterilization incident and his interference with the hospital’s sterilization processes in the months leading up to it, Capobianco allegedly made false statements, including about his actions earlier that day.The charges of wire fraud provide for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater. The charge of false statements provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and statutes which govern the determination of a sentence in a criminal case.Acting United States Attorney Joshua S. Levy; Christopher Algieri, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Inspector General, Northeast Field Office; Christopher DiMenna, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Division; Fernando McMillan, Special Agent in Charge of the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, New York Field Office; and Robert Coviello Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General, Office of Investigations made the announcement today. Patrick M. Callahan, Deputy Chief of Levy’s Health Care Fraud Unit and Assistant U.S. Attorney William B. Brady of Levy’s Health Care Fraud Unit are prosecuting the case.The details contained in the indictment are allegations. The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.________________________________________TopicHEALTH CARE FRAUDComponentUSAO - Massachusetts"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of ColumbiaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, June 23, 2023Defendant Facilitated $18 Million in Illegal Drug Transactions Using CryptocurrencyWASHINGTON –Milomir Desnica has been extradited from Austria to face charges of running a criminal darknet narcotics marketplace. The charges, unsealed on May 25, 2023, were announced today by United States Attorney Matthew M. Graves and Acting Special Agent in Charge Sarah Linden, of the FBI Washington Field Office’s Criminal and Cyber Division.Desnica, 33, of Smederevska Palanka, Serbia, was indicted on July 26, 2022, by a grand jury in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on charges of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine and one count of conspiracy to launder monetary instruments. The indictment also includes a forfeiture allegation seeking all proceeds of the alleged crimes. Desnica will be arraigned on the charges on a date to be determined by the Court.According to the indictment, in late 2019, Desnica launched and operated a darknet marketplace, known as Monopoly Market (“Monopoly”), for the purpose of selling illicit narcotics including opioids, stimulants, psychedelics, and prescription medications, among other drugs. Vendors had to complete an application to sell their products on Monopoly, which included providing descriptions of the drugs they wanted to sell, photographic proof of their inventory, and an agreement to pay a commission for sales completed through Monopoly. As the operator of Monopoly, Desnica reviewed and approved these applications and was aware that vendors were selling narcotics on his website.In 2021, law enforcement within the United States placed and received numerous orders for narcotics on Monopoly from various vendors. Authorities were able to order more than 100 grams of methamphetamine on Monopoly.In December 2021, in coordination with foreign law enforcement partners in Germany and Finland, the computer server hosting Monopoly was seized and taken offline. Through analysis of the seized server, law enforcement identified records of the narcotics sales facilitated by Monopoly, financial records documenting cryptocurrency payments on Monopoly, an online forum associated with Monopoly, communications from the Monopoly operator to vendors, commission payment invoices and more. Through extensive analysis of these records, Desnica was identified as the operator of Monopoly.It is further alleged that between at least April 2020 and July 2022, Desnica used at least two cryptocurrency exchange services to exchange his illicit cryptocurrency, moving between blockchains used to document all cryptocurrency transactions to “clean” his illicit proceeds. Desnica then sold the illicit cryptocurrency to Serbia-based peer-to-peer traders in exchange for fiat currency — all in an effort to launder the proceeds of the illicit narcotics sales.In November 2022, in coordination with the Austrian Fugitive Active Search Team (FAST) and the Public Prosecutors Office Vienna, Desnica was located and arrested in Austria. Law enforcement conducted a search of his residence and vehicle, seizing electronics and cash.The charge of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine carries a statutory maximum sentence of life in prison. The charge of conspiracy to launder monetary instruments carries a maximum term of 20 years in prison. The charges also carry potential financial penalties. The maximum statutory sentence for federal offenses is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes. The sentencing will be determined by the court based on the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.This case is being investigated by the FBI Washington Field Office’s Hi-Tech Opioid Task Force and Germany’s Zentrale Kriminalinspektion (ZKI) Oldenburg Cybercrime Unit. The Hi-Tech Opioid Task Force is composed of FBI agents, analysts, and task force partners, including special agents and officers of the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and detectives from local assisting police agencies. The task force is charged with identifying and investigating the most egregious darknet marketplaces and the vendors operating on the marketplaces who are engaged in the illegal acquisition and distribution of controlled substances, including fentanyl, methamphetamine, and other opioids.Valuable assistance was provided by the Department of Justice’s Office of International Affairs; Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation; Europol; Germany’s Bundeskriminalamt; Austria’s Bundeskriminalamt Cybercrime Competency Center, FAST team, and Public Prosecutors Office Vienna; and the Republic of Serbia High-Tech Crimes Prosecutor. It is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Andy Wang and Nihar Mohanty of the Violence Reduction and Trafficking Offenses (VRTO) Section of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia.An indictment is merely a formal charge that a defendant has committed a violation of criminal laws and every defendant is presumed innocent until, and unless, proven guilty.Topic(s):CybercrimeOpioidsDrug TraffickingComponent(s):USAO - District of ColumbiaPress Release Number:23-350"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeWestern District of MissouriFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, June 22, 2023Forfeits $2.7 Million in Money-Laundering ConspiracyKANSAS CITY, Mo. – A Las Vegas, Nevada, man who made millions of dollars by selling illegal steroids online was sentenced in federal court today for his role in a money-laundering conspiracy.Michael R. Breitel, 39, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Howard F. Sachs to three years and 10 months in federal prison without parole. The court also ordered Breitel to forfeit to the government $2,749,363, which represents the proceeds he obtained as a result of his criminal activity, and which will be offset by $403,735 seized from his bank account and the proceeds from the sale of four parcels of real estate in Nevada.On Oct. 11, 2022, Breitel pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering. Breitel admitted that he and co-defendant Mario Arreola-Soria, 37, of Las Vegas, operated a business known as STACKMEUP from October 2017 through October 2021. STACKMEUP offered various prescription drugs available for purchase without a prescription to customers throughout the United States. Many of the drugs offered for sale were anabolic steroids. Other products available on STACKMEUP are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in humans.Investigators executed a search warrant at two storage units in Nevada on Nov. 3, 2021, that contained STACKMEUP products. Federal agents seized 2,371,800 units of anabolic steroids with a street value of more than $1.7 million.Breitel also admitted that he conspired with others to conduct financial transactions that involved the proceeds of the conspiracy to distribute anabolic steroids. STACKMEUP customers, who paid for the anabolic steroids and associated drugs with cash or through a number of different peer-to-peer payment processors (such as Venmo, Zelle, Square, Paypal and Google Pay), were instructed to describe the transaction as “Gift” because the payment processors would cancel payments if the real reason for payment was used as the description.During the course of the illegal anabolic steroid conspiracy, Breitel purchased four real estate properties in Las Vegas, totaling more than $1.2 million, with proceeds from the money laundering conspiracy. All the properties were purchased with cash and without a mortgage.The federal investigation began when investigators intercepted a package shipped to a bodybuilder, who said he purchased the products from STACKMEUP over Wickr (an encrypted communication application that automatically deletes all messages). The bodybuilder learned of STACKMEUP while at a bodybuilding event in St. Louis, Mo. Agents made seven undercover purchases from STACKMEUP during the investigation. Some of the purchased drugs were tested and, in several instances, the product did not contain the active pharmaceutical ingredient that was claimed or contained different ingredients.Arreola-Soria was sentenced on May 3, 2023, to three years in federal prison without parole.This case was prosecuted by Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Bradley Cooper. It was investigated by Food and Drug Administration – Office of Criminal Investigations, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the Johnson County, Kan., Sheriff’s Department and the Henderson, Nevada, Police Department.________________________________________TopicPRESCRIPTION DRUGSComponentUSAO - Missouri, Western"

Handberg announces that Brandon Albanito (37, Cape Coral) has pleaded guilty to a six-count information charging him with possession of a controlled substance (fentanyl) with the intent to distribute it, two counts of possessing counterfeit drugs for sale, possessing parts used to manufacture counterfeit drugs, possessing a firearm as a convicted felon, and bank fraud. Albanito faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in federal prison for the bank fraud, up to 20 years’ imprisonment for the controlled substance offenses, up to 15 years on the firearms offense, and lesser penalties for the counterfeit drug charges.  Albanito has agreed to forfeit $97,146.95, traceable to the fraud offense, and the other items he possessed illegally, including a pill press and firearms. Albanito is also required to make full restitution to the financial institution which was the victim of his fraud scheme.According to court documents, in March 2021, Albanito defrauded his federally insured bank with a scheme involving falsely disputed cash transfers which he had authorized. Albanito illegally obtained $97,146.95 through the scheme. In furtherance of its investigation into his fraud, the U.S. Secret Service executed a search warrant at Albanito’s Cape Coral residence in January 2023. Upon entry into the residence, law enforcement observed a large, commercial-grade pill press in the garage and hundreds of counterfeit oxycodone pills on a nearby shelf. The counterfeit pills, which appeared identical to prescription oxycodone pills, were found to contain fentanyl.Law enforcement obtained a second warrant permitting them to search for and seize evidence related to drug manufacturing and distribution. During this search, they seized a five-gallon bucket containing approximately 30 pounds of counterfeit alprazolam pills (which actually contained the designer drug clonazolam), a five-gallon bucket containing approximately 20 pounds of pill binding agent, pill dies (i.e. tooling used by a pill press to create pills), and two firearms within the residence. DNA testing conducted on both firearms determined that Albanito had possessed them. Albanito was previously convicted in two federal cases (2011) involving money laundering, drug distribution, creating false identification documents, and possessing a firearm as a felon. As such, he is prohibited from possessing a firearm or ammunition under federal law.This case was investigated by the United States Secret Service, the United States Food and Drug Administration, the Cape Coral Police Department, with assistance from the Pasco Sheriff’s Office. It is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Michael V. Leeman.________________________________________TopicsOPIOIDSDRUG TRAFFICKINGPRESCRIPTION DRUGSFINANCIAL FRAUDFIREARMS OFFENSESComponentUSAO - Florida, Middle"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeEastern District of North CarolinaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, June 16, 2023RALEIGH, N.C. – Anita Louise Jackson, 62, was sentenced to 300 months in prison for adulterating surgical devices used in more than 1400 nasal surgeries performed on Medicare patients between 2011 and 2018. Jackson was also ordered to serve 3 years of supervised release and ordered to forfeit 4.7 million dollars.  In January of this year, Jackson was found guilty by a federal jury on 20 criminal counts, including device adulteration, fraud, conspiracy and identity theft.“This doctor put profit over patients by reusing single-use surgical devices hundreds of times, even though those devices came into contact with blood and other bodily fluids.  In doing so, she risked the contamination of one patient’s sinuses with the bodily fluids of other patients,” said U.S. Attorney Michael Easley.  “Medicare auditors also found that Jackson was the top-biller for balloon sinuplasty surgeries in the country, having billed the program over $46 million.  When auditors began to audit the defendant’s practice, she and her staff falsified medical records and forged patient signatures in an attempt to justify billing the surgeries.”Evidence presented at the trial demonstrated that Jackson was an Ear, Nose and Throat doctor who operated Greater Carolina Ear, Nose, and Throat (GCENT), with offices in Raleigh, Lumberton and Rockingham.  Jackson, through her employees, marketed balloon sinuplasty, an in-office procedure to treat chronic sinusitis, as a “sinus spa,” and encouraged patients to come to the office for a “free” sinus spa, which was a treatment that they may not have needed.  Jackson falsified medical records to justify the billing of balloon sinuplasty surgeries to Medicare auditors.“This case is a reminder that health care fraud is not a victimless crime. Jackson stole millions of dollars that are essential to the Medicare program and willfully endangered her patients’ health,” said Special Agent in Charge Tamala E. Miles of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General.  “Our agency, working with our law enforcement partners, will continue to ensure that those who defraud our federal health care programs and needlessly risk harm to patients are held accountable.”Between 2011 and the end of 2017, Jackson performed 1555 balloon sinuplasty surgeries on 919 Medicare beneficiary patients, using the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved Entellus XprESS device. However, instead of using the device only once and only on one patient, as required by FDA guidelines, Jackson reused the devices on multiple patients. Between 2012 and 2017, Jackson obtained, at most, 36 new Entellus devices, despite being, at times, the top-paid Medicare provider of balloon sinuplasty services in the country and providing more than 1500 surgeries.  In addition, Jackson failed to inform her patients that they were receiving a procedure with an adulterated device.  During the trial, Jackson admitted that she had sufficient money to buy every patient a new device but chose not to do so.“U.S. consumers rely on FDA oversight to ensure that medical devices are safe and effective. When healthcare providers disregard safety information, including single-use and single-user designations, resulting in the adulteration of medical devices, they put patients’ health at risk,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Patrick Whelan, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Miami Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice providers who jeopardize the public health.”Jackson billed Medicare more than $46 million dollars for the balloon sinuplasty procedures between 2014 and 2018.  In that time, she netted more than $4.79 million from Medicare for these surgeries.  That amount does not include any sinuplasty surgeries performed on patients with private health care insurance.  The jury ordered Jackson to forfeit these profits.The final judgment on restitution in this case will not be entered until after 90 days.  During this time period, patient victims will have an opportunity to present any specific claims of loss to the Court arising from the charges.Michael Easley, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina made the announcement after sentencing by United States Judge James C. Dever III.  The United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG), the United States Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI), and the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service lead the investigation.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys William M. Gilmore and Karen K. Haughton prosecuted the case.The U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Middle District has a pending civil action against Jackson, in case captioned:  United States of America and the State of North Carolina ex rel.

Kavanaugh said today. “When doctors add to this mounting problem by overprescribing these powerful drugs, they must be held accountable, and we will continue to do exactly that.”“Virginians have suffered at the hands of pharmaceutical corporations and greedy doctors by overprescribing opioids - treating our population  like a science experiment. Now, corrupt health care providers are manipulating the sale of drugs designed for opioids abuse recovery. Enough is enough. I'm proud of the role we’re playing in holding accountable bad actors who abuse the system and illegally prioritize profit over recovery,” Attorney General Jason Miyares said today“Buprenorphine, when properly prescribed, is an important tool in battling the opioid crisis.

At his clinics, Reach and other medical providers wrote prescriptions for buprenorphine (including Suboxone and Subutex), clonazepam, gabapentin, and other drugs.  The prescriptions at issue were not valid because they were dispensed without a legitimate medical purpose and beyond the bounds of professional practice.Senior United States District Judge James P.

Sessions III to two years of probation for conspiring to distribute Tramadol. Tramadol is an opioid used for pain relief and is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance under federal law.According to court records, beginning in or about January 2020 and continuing through 2021, Gentile became involved in receiving and redistributing controlled substances and misbranded pharmaceutical drugs shipped to him by a drug supplier in India. Typically, large quantities of the substances, including Tramadol and others, were shipped from outside the United States and received by Gentile in Colorado. Gentile then redistributed smaller quantities of the substances, including Tramadol, to customers via mail. Gentile also shipped a package to a Vermont coconspirator and received electronic payments from the Vermont coconspirator as reimbursement for shipping and packaging drugs. Gentile was arrested in March 2022. At the time of his arrest, investigators seized approximately 17,500 pills from his vehicle. The pills included Tramadol and other Schedule IV controlled substances like Alprazolam (Xanax) and Zolpidem (Ambien), among others.U.S. Attorney Nikolas P. Kerest commented, “At a time when counterfeit prescription drugs are being used to hide fentanyl from unsuspecting users, it is especially important for law enforcement to be on the look out for prescription drugs being distributed without signoff from a medical professional.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeCentral District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEMonday, June 5, 2023LOS ANGELES – A Pomona man and his food wholesale company have pleaded guilty in federal court to attempting to smuggle Chinese frozen roasted eel for human consumption which had been previously refused entry into the United States, federal authorities announced today.Kevin Sheng Hsiang Fang, 41, and Fang’s City of Industry-based food wholesale business, Yong Chang Trading Co., Ltd. (dba Heng Xing Foods, Inc.), each pleaded guilty May 31 to one count of smuggling and one count of introducing adulterated food into interstate commerce.Fang was a high-volume importer of Chinese frozen roasted eel, commonly known as unagi. The criminal case stems from a shipment of Fang’s imported Chinese frozen roasted eel that was sample tested by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and found to be unsafe for human consumption, which prompted the FDA to refuse its entry into the United States. Fang admitted that he knowingly re-imported the previously refused Chinese frozen roasted eel, using new entry information and comingled with other eel to evade detection.When he pleaded guilty, Fang admitted that the Chinese frozen roasted eel which he tried to import and distribute was adulterated with Gentian Violet, Leucogentian Violet and Malachite Green, unsafe new animal drugs. The use of these antibiotics or chemicals during various stages of aqua-cultured food can result in the presence of residues of the parent compound or its metabolites in the edible portion of the aqua-cultured seafood. The presence of antibiotic residues may contribute to an increase of antimicrobial resistance in human pathogens, according to an FDA alert. Moreover, prolonged exposure to Malachite Green and Gentian Violet has been shown to have a carcinogenic effect.The FDA, in partnership with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), serves as the first line of defense for America’s imported seafood supply chain and utilizes import alerts for aqua-cultured seafood from countries around the world. Seafood and fish products are temporarily detained with FDA detention holds to prevent the introduction of contaminated food product into commerce. The FDA contacts importers to advise of the hold with a detention hold notification and waits for the sample testing results to establish that a seafood or fish product is non-violative. The regulatory framework prevents the entry and distribution of potentially violative or unsafe seafood to customers in the United States, and it serves to protect the integrity and safety of the imported fish and seafood supply chain for human consumption.“Federal laws that prohibits the smuggling of certain food products are intended to protect consumers from hazards to their health,” said United States Attorney Martin Estrada. “We are committed to working with our law enforcement partners to protect the American people from such public health dangers and to ensure the safety of our food supply.”“Today’s announcement serves as a reminder that food importers have a critical responsibility to sell food that is safe for American consumers to eat,” said Special Agent in Charge Robert M. Iwanicki of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, Los Angeles Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who put the public health at risk by distributing adulterated foods in the U.S. marketplace.”“This individual showed complete disregard for the health and safety of the U.S. consumer by knowingly bringing tainted products into the market,” said Eddy Wang, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Los Angeles Acting Special Agent in Charge. “Thanks to the professionalism and dedication of multiple partner agencies, this criminal activity has been disrupted.”“The result of this investigation to detect and prevent the illegal trade of wildlife species was made possible through the diligent work, dedication, and collaboration among all law enforcement agencies involved,” said Special Agent in Charge Manisa Kung of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Office of Law Enforcement, Pacific Southwest Region.Fang is scheduled to be sentenced on August 14 by United States District Judge Percy Anderson. As a result of his guilty pleas, Fang will face a statutory maximum sentence of 21 years in federal prison.This case was investigated by the FDA, Office of Criminal Investigations; Homeland Security Investigations; and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.Assistant United States Attorney Amanda M.

Cosie faces a maximum penalty of six years in federal prison. His sentencing is set for September 21, 2023. As part of his plea, Cosie agreed to forfeit any unapproved or misbranded drugs.According to the plea agreement, in Jacksonville, Florida and elsewhere, Cosie operated a business called HCSGRX from approximately 2016 through 2020. HCGRX advertised itself as a distributor of weight loss and bodybuilding supplements. Among other supplements, Cosie sold a number of products containing HCG, which he falsely stated consumers could purchase as a weight loss supplement without having to obtain a valid prescription. Cosie falsely claimed on his website that his company was cooperating with international pharmacies to ship orders out. The investigation revealed that Cosie obtained unapproved prescription drugs containing HCG from foreign manufacturers and other sources, then applied to the vials his own counterfeit labels which contained false and misleading information. Cosie then knowingly and intentionally sold the drugs to consumers without a prescription or the supervision of a licensed medical practitioner. From October 28, 2017, through December 24, 2020, Cosie received approximately $626,202 in proceeds from the distribution of misbranded drugs, and $20,000 when he sold the HCGRX business.Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (“HCG”) is a hormone produced by the placenta during pregnancy. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several prescription drugs containing HCG for the treatment of female infertility and for other medical conditions. The FDA has not approved any HCG-containing products for weight loss, nor for any purpose without a prescription.This case was investigated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeEastern District of PennsylvaniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, June 1, 2023PHILADELPHIA – United States Attorney Jacqueline C. Romero announced that William Merlino, 85, of Mays Landing, NJ, was sentenced to thirty-three months in prison and one year of supervised release by United States District Court Judge Gerald A. McHugh for selling misbranded drugs online and obstruction of justice.The chemical 2,4-Dinitrophenol (“DNP”) has a variety of industrial and commercial uses, such as herbicides, dyes, and wood preservatives. In the 1930s, before federal law required drugs to be proven safe before they were marketed, DNP was used as a weight-loss drug despite significant adverse side effects, including dehydration, cataracts, liver damage, and death. Owing to DNP’s toxicity, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has never approved DNP for human consumption.A year-long investigation by the FDA revealed that Merlino, a retired physician, packaged and sold DNP for human consumption as a weight-loss drug, and that he used Twitter to advertise, eBay to sell, and email to communicate with customers in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Merlino operated his online business out of his home from at least November 2017 until March 2019, and earned approximately $54,000 from his sales of DNP to hundreds of customers. A search warrant executed at the defendant's residence recovered bulk DNP, packaging and encapsulating materials, and a pill press.In December 2019, Merlino was charged with one count of introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce in connection with operating his illegal business, and in August of 2021, while under indictment and awaiting trial on the misbranding charge, he faked a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in order to avoid trial. Based on forged medical records and doctor’s letters submitted to the court, Merlino’s trial was delayed several months. When the obstruction was discovered in January 2022, he was charged with obstructing justice and detained.In August 2022, Merlino was convicted at trial of the misbranding charge, and subsequently pleaded guilty to the obstruction charge in January 2023. During the trial, a witness from the shipping service the defendant used to ship the drug to customers testified that they referred to Merlino among their colleagues as “the yellow man,” owing to the fact that every time he would bring in a package to ship, they would see yellow dust from the chemical on his skin, nails, and clothes. At sentencing, the government presented evidence that a customer in the U.K. died of DNP toxicity after ingesting pills he purchased from Merlino, who knew that DNP was toxic to humans and illegal to market as a drug.“Misbranding and selling a toxic chemical not fit for human consumption as a diet drug places the public at grave and obvious risk,” said U.S. Attorney Romero. “The defendant’s deliberate, dangerous, and deceptive conduct in this case was egregious, and resulted in the tragic loss of a life. His faking having cancer to avoid accountability in our justice system only underscores his shocking contempt for the law.”“Distributing unapproved and potentially toxic drugs under false labeling and in a deliberate attempt to avoid regulatory scrutiny endangers consumers who are in many cases desperate for treatment,” said Special Agent in Charge George A. Scavdis, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office. “The fact a medical professional was involved makes the situation ever more troubling.  We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who jeopardize the public health.”The cases were investigated by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, U. S. Postal Inspection Service, and Homeland Security Investigations (“HSI”) Atlantic City under the HSI Newark office and are being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Joan Burnes.________________________________________TopicCONSUMER PROTECTIONComponentUSAO - Pennsylvania, Eastern"

Sellinger announced.Anise Kachadourian, 55, of Towaco, New Jersey, a board-certified oncologist, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Susan D. Wigenton in Newark federal court to an information charging her with, which had been previously purchased using her medical license and under the representation that such medication was to be used to treat her patients.According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:While working in her medical practice’s offices in various locations in unlawfully selling prescription cancer medication New Jersey, Kachadourian was recruited by an individual who owned a pharmacy and also owned and operated two businesses that were wholesale distributors of prescription drugs. At the request of this individual and others working with him, in return for payment of approximately $5,000 per month, Kachadourian used her medical license – and allowed others to use it – to purchase expensive prescription drugs, primarily, cold-chain biologic infusion medications that typically are used to treat cancers, macular degeneration, and autoimmune diseases. By recruiting and using Kachadourian and her medical license to purchase the drugs, these individuals were able to obtain prescription drugs from the pharmaceutical manufacturers’ authorized distributors that they would not otherwise have been permitted to purchase. They were then able to sell them at a profit through their two businesses.In purchasing the drugs, Kachadourian and the individuals made numerous false and misleading representations to the pharmaceutical manufacturers and authorized distributors, including that Kachadourian purchased the drugs to use to treat her patients, and that the drugs would not be resold or redistributed. In actuality, none of the drugs were administered to any of Kachadourian’s patients but were ultimately sold to customers of the two businesses. Kachadourian was paid more than $170,000 for purchasing and allowing others to purchase in her name millions of dollars in prescription drugs during the scheme, which ran from October 2016 through January 2019.Kachadourian is the third doctor who has pleaded guilty in connection with this fraudulent scheme.The sale of prescription drugs purchased by a healthcare entity is punishable by a maximum of three years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of West VirginiaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, May 25, 2023CHARLESTON, W.Va. – Brian Gullett, D.O., 46, of Clarksville, Pennsylvania, was sentenced today to six months in prison, to be followed by one year of supervised release, and fined $5,000 for aiding and abetting obtaining a controlled substance by fraud. Gullett admitted to unlawful prescription practices at HOPE (Hitech Opioid Pharmachovigilance Expertise) Clinic, a purported pain management clinic that operated in Beckley, Beaver and Charleston, West Virginia, and Wytheville, Virginia.Gullett also surrendered his medical license and his Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) certificate of registration and agreed not to apply for re-registration to dispense Schedule II controlled substances.“The criminal conduct in this case exploited and worsened an already devastating opioid crisis,” said United States Attorney Will Thompson. “This office and its law enforcement partners are resolved to bring to justice those who allow greed to outweigh their oaths and duties as health care professionals.”According to court documents and statements made in court, from November 2010 until June 11, 2015, practitioners associated with HOPE Clinic prescribed thousands of oxycodone- and morphine-based pills to individual customers. Some of these prescriptions provided customers with an average of four to seven pills per day. Several HOPE Clinic locations averaged 65 or more customers a day during a 10-hour workday with only one practitioner working.Gullett admitted to signing multiple oxycodone prescriptions for 120 pills of 30 milligrams each and 30 pills of 15 milligrams each for a HOPE Clinic customer at the Charleston location on March 13, 2013. Gullett further admitted that the customer’s medical chart did not support these prescriptions and that the prescriptions were not for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual course of professional medical practice.Evidence showed that the customer had multiple failed drug screenings, reported being addicted to pain medication, bought pills on the street, and sold pills from his HOPE Clinic prescriptions to others. Gullett admitted that he did not discuss the possibility of addiction or the need for addiction treatment with the customer.“Medical professionals who circumvent the rules for prescribing powerful and potentially addictive pain-killers contribute to the opioids crisis facing our nation,” said Special Agent in Charge George A. Scavdis, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office. “Our office will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who see addiction as an opportunity for profit.”Gullett was initially indicted in 2018 along with the owners, managers and other physicians associated with HOPE Clinic and PPPFD. Five other physicians have also pleaded guilty. The remaining defendants are awaiting trial. An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.Thompson made the announcement and commended the investigative work of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services-Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigations (IRS-CI), the Food and Drug Administration-Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the West Virginia State Police, the Metropolitan Drug Enforcement Network Team (MDENT), the Beckley Police Department, the Kentucky State Police, the Harrison County, Kentucky, Sheriff’s Department, and the Appalachia High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Task Force (AHIDTA).United States District Judge Frank W. Volk imposed the sentences. Assistant United States Attorneys Monica Coleman, Steve Loew and Owen Reynolds prosecuted the case.This prosecution was part of an Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) investigation. OCDETF identifies, disrupts, and dismantles the highest-level drug traffickers, money launderers, gangs, and transnational criminal organizations that threaten the United States by using a prosecutor-led, intelligence-driven, multi-agency approach that leverages the strengths of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies against criminal networks.This case is part of an ongoing effort led by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of West Virginia to combat the illicit sale and misuse of prescription drugs and heroin. The U.S. Attorney’s Office, joined by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, is committed to aggressively pursuing and shutting down pill trafficking, eliminating open air drug markets, and curtailing the spread of opiate painkillers and heroin in communities across the Southern District.A copy of this press release is located on the website of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of West Virginia.

Pinto, Special Agent in Chargeat the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “Protecting the safety of Medicare and Medicaid patients is crucial, and HHS-OIG is committed to ensuring that taxpayer dollars are not used for unapproved, potentially dangerous medical substances, that put patients at risk.”“The FDA requirements are designed to ensure the safety, efficacy, and quality of drugs distributed to American consumers,” saidSpecial Agent in Charge Ronne L. Malham, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI) Chicago Field Office. “We commend the efforts of the Department of Justice to protect the public health and hold accountable those who place profits over patient safety.”“We will continue to work with our partners to prioritize the safety of our Michigan residents,” saidDetroit Special Agent in Charge Angie M. Salazar, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). “Unregulated goods, more importantly those used in medical treatments, present a variety or dangers and risks that no patient should be subject to.”The resolution obtained in this matter was the result of a coordinated effort between the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Michigan, HHS-OIG, FDA-OCI, and HSI.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew J.

Ms. Chacona abused her position of trust to steal powerful prescription pain medications intended for surgical patients and replace them with saline,” said U.S. Attorney Michael Easley. “In delivering today’s sentence the judge noted that these patients were in the most vulnerable position. My office will continue to pursue healthcare providers whose crimes jeopardize public safety.”According to court documents and other information presented in court, Chacona, 45, worked as a nurse at a Raleigh-area surgical practice. In early 2019, she began extracting the medication from vials of fentanyl, morphine, and meperidine and replacing it with saline. She did this for several months, compromising at least seventy-eight vials, including those intended for surgical patients. Testing revealed that compromised vials contained less than 15% of the actual medication and that the tampering had rendered multiple vials unsterile.Chacona has also been convicted at the state level for diverting medication earlier in her nursing career. Her plea agreement requires permanent surrender of her nursing license.Michael Easley, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina made the announcement after sentencing by U.S. District Judge James C.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of Rhode IslandFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, May 17, 2023PROVIDENCE – The United States has resolved civil claims against a Massachusetts medical device manufacturer for selling Chinese-made products to the federal government that were required by law to have been made in America, announced United States Attorney Zachary A. Cunha.The civil settlement, reached with Zoll Medical Corporation, a supplier of medical devices and related technology that is headquartered in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, follows an investigation into allegations that, between January 2019 and November 2022, Zoll sold electrocardiogram cables (“ECG”), which are used with defibrillators and cardiac monitors, to federal government purchasers, including the U.S. Department of Defense, despite knowing that the cables were manufactured in China, rather than the United States.  Under the federal Trade Agreements Act, goods sold to the military or federal government purchasers must be made in America or certain designated foreign countries; China is not such a country.In addition, the government alleges that, in January of 2019, Zoll inaccurately represented to government officials that replacement ECG cables offered by Zoll to federal government purchasers had, in fact, been manufactured in the United States.This settlement marks the third civil resolution obtained by the District of Rhode Island since 2022 that involves allegedly false representations concerning foreign-manufactured goods that were passed off to government purchasers as American-made; it also follows two successful criminal prosecutions by this office, individuals who had various roles in a conspiracy that directed the development, manufacture, and importation of $20 million worth of Chinese-made counterfeit U.S. military uniforms and gear that were passed off as genuine American-made products and sold to the U.S. government.“When corporations choose to supply the American military and American government agencies with goods, the law is clear: we expect those goods to be American made,” said U.S. Attorney Cunha. “When companies fail in their legal duty by substituting foreign products for the U.S-origin goods that the law requires, we will hold them accountable.”Under the terms of a civil settlement agreement with the United States, Zoll will pay $400,000 to the federal government to resolve claims based on this conduct under the common law doctrines of payment by mistake and breach of contract.These allegations were brought to the government’s attention by Jing Zhang, a former Zoll employee, who filed a qui tam complaint on behalf of the United States in May of 2019, alleging that Zoll violated the False Claims Act. After an extensive investigation of the whistleblower’s allegations, the government has entered into its settlement of common law claims with Zoll as an alternate remedy under the False Claims Act.Assistant U.S. Attorneys Bethany Wong and Dulce Donovan litigated the matter.The case was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, Rhode Island Task Force; Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service; Naval Criminal Investigative Service, Northeast Field Office; Army Criminal Investigation Division, Major Procurement Fraud Field Office; Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Procurement Fraud Detachment 6; Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General, Criminal Investigations Division, Northeast Field Office; Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General; and U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, Boston Field Office.###zoll_settlement_agreement.pdf (344.75 KB)ContactJim Martin(401) 709-5357________________________________________ComponentUSAO - Rhode IslandPress Release Number:23-60"

O’Shea, United States Attorney for the Western District of Wisconsin, announced the filing of an information and plea agreement charging Dawn Drum, 54, Janesville, Wisconsin, with product tampering while employed as a Registered Nurse at SSM Health St. Mary’s Hospital in Janesville in November 2021.According to the information and plea agreement filed today, Drum tampered with vials of fentanyl by withdrawing the drug from the vials and replacing it with saline and then resealing the vial stopper with what appeared to be superglue. Drum then put the tampered vials back into a Pyxis machine, an automated medication dispensing system, so that the tampered fentanyl vials would be available for use with other patients at the hospital.  An audit of the Pyxis transactions in Drum’s name revealed that she had an excessive pattern of fentanyl overrides and wastes when compared to other employees in 2021. In November 2021, hospital management confronted Drum with this discrepancy and asked her to take a drug test. Drum refused and instead resigned from her position at the hospital.According to the plea agreement, the parties are recommending the Court impose a sentence of 18 months imprisonment and a fine of $30,000 due and payable immediately at sentencing.  A date for Drum’s plea hearing has not been scheduled.  The statutory maximum penalties for the product tampering charge are 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.The charges against Drum were the result of an investigation conducted by the Food and Drug Administration--Office of Criminal Investigations, and the Drug Enforcement Administration--Diversion Control Division.  The prosecution of the case is being handled by Assistant U.

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASETuesday, May 2, 2023Today, the Department of Justice, and its Joint Criminal Opioid and Darknet Enforcement (JCODE) team and international partners, announced the results of Operation SpecTor, which included 288 arrests – the most ever for any JCODE operation and nearly double that of the prior operation. Law enforcement also conducted more seizures than any prior operation, including 117 firearms, 850 kilograms of drugs that include 64 kilograms of fentanyl or fentanyl-laced narcotics, and $53.4 million in cash and virtual currencies.Operation SpecTor was a coordinated international effort spanning three continents to disrupt fentanyl and opioid trafficking on the darknet, or dark web. The operation was conducted across the United States, Europe, and South America, and was a result of the continued partnership between JCODE and foreign law enforcement against the illegal sale of drugs and other illicit goods and services on the darknet. Operation SpecTor builds on the successes of prior years’ operations and takedowns of marketplaces, which result in the seizure of darknet infrastructure providing investigators across the world with investigative leads and evidence. JCODE and Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) continue to compile intelligence packages to identify entities of interest. These leads allow U.S. and international law enforcement agencies to identify darknet drug vendors and buyers, resulting in a series of coordinated, but separate, law enforcement investigations, resulting in the statistics announced today.This year’s law enforcement operation was accompanied by a public awareness campaign called Operation ProtecTor aimed to promote public safety and spread awareness of resources for those struggling with substance abuse and who go through extreme lengths to obtain opioids. JCODE has worked with every FBI field office in the country to facilitate outreach to households that have purchased individual amounts of opioids from the darknet. The interagency efforts are aimed to both identify those who use anonymizing technologies to purchase illicit narcotics and direct them to available resources.“Operation SpecTor was a coordinated international law enforcement effort, spanning three continents, to disrupt drug trafficking on the dark web and represents the most funds seized and the highest number of arrests in any coordinated international action led by the Justice Department against drug traffickers on the dark web,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “Our message to criminals on the dark web is this: You can try to hide in the furthest reaches of the internet, but the Justice Department will find you and hold you accountable for your crimes.”“The availability of dangerous substances like fentanyl on dark net marketplaces is helping to fuel the crisis that has claimed far too many American lives,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray. “That's why we will continue to join forces with our law enforcement partners around the globe to attack this problem together. The FBI is proud to stand with our domestic and foreign partners as we continue to shine that light into the deepest corners of the dark net and hold those accountable who continue to peddle this poison around the world.”“The Sinaloa and Jalisco drug cartels, and the global networks they operate are killing Americans by sending fentanyl into the United States. Their associates distribute this fentanyl into communities across America by every means possible, including the dark web,” said DEA Administrator Anne Milgram. “The DEA is committed to shutting down the fentanyl supply chain from beginning to end, and we will relentlessly pursue the associates of these cartels wherever they hide, even in the dark corners of the internet.”“Our coalition of law enforcement authorities across three continents proves that we all do better when we work together,” said Executive Director Catherine De Bolle of Europol. “This operation sends a strong message to criminals on the dark web: international law enforcement has the means and the ability to identify and hold you accountable for your illegal activities, even on the dark web.”“Collaboration with our law enforcement partners is key to combatting fentanyl and opioid trafficking,” said Chief Jim Lee of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI). “Under the JCODE umbrella, law enforcement agencies across the globe have joined forces to take down criminals who use the darknet to buy and sell narcotics. Our team at IRS-CI plays an integral role in these investigations by following the money trail, whether it’s in fiat currency or digital assets on the blockchain.”“The illicit movement of opioids poses a significant threat to public health and safety – whether by known transnational criminal gang members across international borders or anonymously through darknet spaces,” said Senior Official Performing the Duties of Deputy Director P.J. Lechleitner of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). “Our HSI special agents, alongside federal and international partners, continue to aggressively investigate, disrupt, and dismantle networks responsible for trafficking dangerous, deadly narcotics and other contraband across global communities we are charged with protecting. We will continue to pursue bad actors engaged in these crimes to ensure they face justice, while protecting victims from these lethal substances.”“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service leverages our specialized knowledge of the postal system as part of sophisticated dark web investigations such as Operation SpecTor with great results,” said Chief Postal Inspector Gary R. Barksdale of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. “We are committed to taking all necessary actions to combat illicit drugs in the mail. And we thank our law enforcement partners for working with us to achieve this; removing dangerous illicit substances from the mail and American communities saves lives.”“Addressing our nation’s drug overdose crisis and epidemic of substance use disorders is an issue of great concern and remains a top public health priority for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA),” said Commissioner Robert M. Califf, M.D., of the FDA. “The FDA has undertaken strategic and impactful actions to prevent drug overdoses and reduce deaths and is committed to using all of our cyber-resources to shed light on the darkest corners of illicit medical supply chains for the health and safety of all Americans.”Operation SpecTor resulted in over 100 federal operations and prosecutions, including:•    On Dec. 1, 2022, Anton Peck, 29, of Boca Raton, Florida, was sentenced to 16 years in prison for conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute controlled substances, including fentanyl, methamphetamine, and heroin. According to court documents, between May 2021 and May 2022, Peck distributed narcotics from various darknet markets using the vendor profile “Syntropy.” After the transactions were carried out using cryptocurrency, Peck and co-conspirators Kevin Fusco and Vincent Banner mailed parcels containing fentanyl, heroin, and methamphetamine to cities around the country using the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). Fusco, 35, of West Palm Beach, Florida, was sentenced to 11 years in prison for conspiring to distribute fentanyl, heroin, and methamphetamine. Banner, 31, of Boynton Beach, Florida, is scheduled to be sentenced on June 8 after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute fentanyl, methamphetamine, and heroin. Law enforcement recovered kilogram quantities of fentanyl, cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin from business and storage locations in West Palm Beach, Boca Raton, and New York City. Peck possessed a list of more than 6,000 customers living across the United States. The DEA, FBI, USPS Office of Inspector General (USPS-OIG), U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office investigated the case. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida is prosecuting the case.•    On Nov. 18, 2022, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Christopher Hampton, 36, of Cerritos, California, with heading an organization that obtained bulk fentanyl, operated labs in California that used high-speed pill presses to create fake pills containing fentanyl and methamphetamine, and sold millions of pills to thousands of customers on the darknet. Hampton was named in an 11-count indictment that charges him with various narcotics and weapons offenses that could result in a sentence of life in prison. According to court documents, he was active on at least nine darknet marketplaces where he typically used the moniker “Narco710.” Hampton allegedly sold nearly $2 million worth of narcotics on two of these darknet marketplaces alone. He was arrested on Nov. 2, 2022, at which time federal law enforcement executed search warrants that led to the discovery and seizure of 450 pounds of suspected narcotics; six pill press machines, some of which were capable of producing thousands of pills per hour; and illegal firearms that included assault rifles and a machine gun. Agents later located a storage unit linked to the drug conspiracy and seized over 80 pounds of pressed fentanyl pills, eight guns, and precursor materials to press additional pills. The FBI JCODE and DEA HIDTA Tactical Diversion Squad investigated the case. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California is prosecuting the case.•    On May 12, 2022, a federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment charging Holly Adams, 31, and Devlin Hosner, 33, of Indio, California, with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute fentanyl and methamphetamine, and with conspiracy to launder money. According to court documents, Adams and Hosner operated the vendor accounts “igogrrawwr” and “its4real” on the darknet marketplaces ToRReZ and Darkode, respectively, through which they sold tens of thousands of counterfeit oxycodone pills containing fentanyl in exchange for cryptocurrency. Adams and Hosner shipped these fentanyl pills to buyers throughout the United States, using the USPS, UPS, and other means of delivery. In the course of their conspiracy, Adams and Hosner finalized over 1,100 transactions of narcotics and other contraband and received more than $800,000 in cryptocurrency. Federal law enforcement officers executed a search warrant at a hotel in Riverside county where Adams and Hosner were residing and recovered more than 10,000 counterfeit oxycodone pills as well as approximately 60 grams of methamphetamine. The IRS-CI, HSI, FBI, USPIS, and USPS-OIG investigated the case. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of California is prosecuting the case.Operation SpecTor was a collaborative initiative across JCODE members, including the Department of Justice, FBI, DEA, USPIS, HSI, IRS-CI, ATF, Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), and the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations. This operation was aided by non-operational supporting participation from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Local, state, and other federal agencies also contributed to Operation SpecTor investigations through task force participation and regional partnerships. The investigations leading to Operation SpecTor were significantly aided by support and coordination by the Justice Department’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF); multi-agency Special Operations Division; the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section’s Digital Currency Initiative, Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section, and Fraud Section; the Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs; Europol and its Dark Web team; and international partners. The international partners include Eurojust; Austria’s Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt); France’s Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes (Douane); Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt), Central Criminal Investigation Department of Oldenburg (Zentrale KriminaIinspektion Oldenburg), General Prosecutor’s Office in Frankfurt/Main - Cybercrime Center (Generalstaatsanwaltschaft Frankfurt/Main, Zentralstelle zur Bekämpfung der Internetkriminalität), Berlin Police (Polizei Berlin), various police departments (Dienststellen der Länderpolizeien), German Customs Investigation (Zollfahndungsämter); the Netherland’s National Police (Politie); Poland’s Central Cybercrime Bureau (Centralne Biuro Zwalczania Cyberprzestępczości); Brazil’s Civil Police of the State of Piauí (Polícia Civil do Estado do Piauí), Civil Police of the Federal District (Polícia Civil do Distrito Federal), National Secretariat of Public Security - Directorate of Integrated Operations and Intelligence - Cyber Operations Laboratory (Laboratório de Operações Cibernéticas da Diretoria de Operações Integradas e de Inteligência - Secretaria Nacional de Segurança Pública); Switzerland’s Zurich Cantonal Police (Kantonspolizei Zürich) and Public Prosecutor’s Office II of the Canton of Zurich (Staatsanwaltschaft II); and the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency (NCA) and National Police Chief’s Council (NPCC).Federal investigations and prosecutions are being conducted in more than 30 federal districts, including the District of Arizona, the Central District of California, the Eastern District of California, the Northern District of California, the Southern District of California, the District of Colorado, the District of Connecticut, the District of Columbia, the District of Delaware, the Southern District of Florida, the Northern District of Georgia, the Southern District of Indiana, the Eastern District of Kentucky, the District of Maryland, the District of Massachusetts, the Eastern District of Michigan, the Western District of Michigan, the Eastern District of Missouri, the Western District of Missouri, the District of Nebraska, the District of Nevada, the District of New Jersey, the Eastern District of New York, the Southern District of New York, the Western District of North Carolina, the Northern District of Ohio, the Southern District of Ohio, the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the Middle District of Pennsylvania, the District of South Dakota, the Eastern District of Tennessee, the Eastern District of Texas, the Northern District of Texas, the Southern District of Texas, the District of Vermont, the Eastern District of Virginia, and the Western District of Washington.The Justice Department established the FBI-led JCODE team to lead and coordinate government efforts to detect, disrupt, and dismantle major criminal enterprises reliant on the darknet for trafficking opioids and other illicit narcotics, along with identifying and dismantling their supply chains.An indictment is merely an allegation.

She removed the hydromorphone from the vials and syringes, replaced the hydromorphone with saline solution, and returned the adulterated containers knowing they could be administered to patients at the hospital. In total, Cheatham stole 116 vials and syringes of hydromorphone, which she then used on herself.“Patients in a hospital should be able to rely on receiving their needed medications,” said U.S. Attorney Ison.  “We will not hesitate to prosecute health care workers who steal drugs and put patients at serious risk of harm.”The investigation was conducted by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations.The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Regina R. McCullough.________________________________________TopicCONSUMER PROTECTIONComponentUSAO - Michigan, Eastern"

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEMonday, April 24, 2023A Georgia physician pleaded guilty today to charges related to the sale of a purported weight loss drug product that contained human chorionic gonadotropin, or HCG.Dr. Audrey Arona, 64, of Gainesville, Georgia, pleaded guilty to causing the introduction into interstate commerce of a misbranded drug product containing HCG and marketed under the name “Releana.” Pursuant to a plea agreement, Magistrate Judge J. Clay Fuller of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia ordered Dr. Arona to forfeit approximately $65,000.HCG is a hormone produced by the human placenta. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved certain injectable HCG drug products for the treatment of some cases of female infertility and for hormone treatment in males. But the FDA has never approved any oral or sublingual HCG drug products for any use, and the FDA has never approved any HCG drug product for weight loss. In fact, FDA has specifically warned consumers to avoid HCG weight-loss products, advising, “If you have HCG products for weight loss, quit using it, throw it out, and stop following the dieting instructions.”“Doctors who distribute drugs must comply with federal law designed to ensure these products are safe and effective,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department will continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners to stop the distribution of misbranded HCG drugs and other misbranded drugs, including through criminal enforcement where appropriate.”“Misbranded prescription drugs can present a serious health risk to those who buy and use them. The drugs may contain unknown ingredients and may be made under unknown conditions,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L. Grinstead of the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Kansas City Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who traffic in misbranded prescription drugs.”According to court documents, Dr. Arona admitted to selling a sublingually administered HCG-for-weight-loss drug product to patients around the country. Dr. Arona further admitted that she represented to patients that the HCG-for-weight-loss drug product was FDA-approved and that it could assist with weight loss.Dr. Arona was the third defendant to plead guilty in connection with the marketing and sale of Releana. In September 2022, Hoschton, Georgia, resident Maurice Bailey also pleaded guilty to causing the introduction into interstate commerce of a misbranded drug product containing HCG. According to court documents, Bailey admitted to preparing the Releana sold by Dr. Arona in a facility that was not properly registered with FDA, and to inaccurately labelling that Releana. In August 2021, Colorado resident Sarah Alberg pleaded guilty to causing the introduction into interstate commerce of a misbranded drug product containing HCG, with the intent to mislead or defraud. According to court documents, Alberg also distributed Releana, and she admitted to smuggling HCG into the United States from India and distributing HCG using bottles and supplies exposed to rodent droppings.The FDA Office of Criminal Investigations investigated the cases.Senior Litigation Counsel Patrick Runkle and Trial Attorney Michael Wadden of the Justice Department’s Consumer Protection Branch prosecuted the cases against Dr. Arona and Bailey, with assistance from Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Keen for the Northern District of Georgia.For more information about the enforcement efforts of the Consumer Protection Branch visit the Branch’s website at http://www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branchTopic(s):Consumer ProtectionComponent(s):Civil DivisionPress Release Number:23-467"

Grinstead, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Kansas City Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice health care professionals who tamper with patients’ medications.”“Trust is the cornerstone of a patient’s relationship with the medical community,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge David Olesky of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Rocky Mountain Field Division.  “Mr. Pattinson violated that trust, and as a result of his actions, the DEA, the FDA, and our partners at the U.S. Attorney’s Office have held him accountable.”United States District Court Judge Charlotte N. Sweeney sentenced the defendant on April 19, 2023.  After his period of incarceration, the defendant will also serve three years on supervised release.  The defendant was also ordered to pay restitution to the hospital.Substance abuse and mental health services are available to medical professionals experiencing addiction and other issues that may be detrimental to their ability to safely practice their profession.  Nurses, dentists, psychologists, pharmacists, and other medical professionals can reach out to nonprofit agency Peer Assistance Services, Inc. (peerassistanceservices.org), and emergency medical professionals can contact nonprofit agency Path4EMS (path4ems.org).  These programs promote earlier identification and intervention to prevent professionals from engaging in unsafe practices.This matter was investigated by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations and the Drug Enforcement Administration.Case No.  22-cr-0263-CNS________________________________________TopicsCONSUMER PROTECTIONOPIOIDSComponentUSAO - Colorado"

Rollins. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office is committed to protecting patients and the integrity of federal health care programs, and we will continue to use our criminal authority to ensure that health care providers play by the rules that protect the public and ensure quality of care.”“Administering misbranded prescription drugs to patients puts their health at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Fernando P. McMillan, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations New York Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who jeopardize the public’s health.”Pursuant to a criminal information filed in federal court in Boston, the United States charged Greater Boston Behavioral Health with violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. As part of the criminal resolution, Greater Boston Behavioral Health has agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor offense, to pay a criminal fine of $657,678 and to forfeit $1,929,464.According to the criminal information, Greater Boston Behavioral Health sought out sources from which it could purchase Botox® that was packaged and labeled only for sale in the United Kingdom and other foreign countries. The label of the foreign Botox purchased by Greater Boston Behavioral Health differed from the FDA-approved label for Botox and Botox Cosmetic and lacked the designation “Rx Only” as required by the FDCA for prescription drugs. The label also typically did not include the FDA-required “black-box warning” concerning potential side-effects of Botox. Greater Boston Behavioral Health purchased foreign Botox at prices significantly below the price that Allergan and its authorized distributors charged for Botox and Botox Cosmetic that was manufactured and labeled for sale in the United States.Doctors at Greater Boston Behavioral Health used the foreign Botox to treat patients suffering from migraine headaches and did not disclose to these patients that they purchased the drug from foreign sources or that it was not labeled for distribution in the United States.U.S. Attorney Rollins and FDA-OCI SAC McMillan made the announcement today.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeCentral District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASETuesday, April 18, 2023LOS ANGELES – A former doctor has been sentenced to 84 months in federal prison for scheming to defraud private insurance companies and the Tricare health care program for U.S. military service members by fraudulently submitting nearly $120 million in claims related to the 1-800-GET-THIN Lap-Band surgery business, the Justice Department announced today.Julian Omidi, 54, of West Hollywood, was sentenced Monday evening by United States District Judge Dolly M. Gee.Judge Gee also sentenced Surgery Center Management LLC (SCM), an Omidi-controlled Beverly Hills-based company, to five years’ probation. A separate hearing on restitution and forfeiture in this case, along with SCM’s fine, is expected in the coming weeks.At the conclusion of a three-month trial, a federal jury in December 2021 found Omidi and SCM guilty of 28 counts of wire fraud and three counts of mail fraud. Omidi also was found guilty of two counts of making false statements relating to health care matters, one count of aggravated identity theft and two counts of money laundering. Omidi and SCM also were found guilty of conspiracy to commit money laundering.“As found by the jury, the defendant Julian Omidi deliberately and repeatedly acted with an eye towards business and profits, rather than in the interest of GET THIN’s medical patients, by inducing patients to undergo medical treatment premised on fraud rather than medical necessity, including surgeries that carry significant risks and life-long health impacts,” said United States Attorney Martin Estrada. “Those who engage in fraud – to the detriment of vulnerable patients and the insurance companies – must always be held accountable.”“Patients rely on medical providers to give them information that is truthful and accurate, so that the patients do not make inappropriate decisions about medical devices, which FDA oversees,” said Special Agent in Charge Robert M. Iwanicki, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office. “When providers give inaccurate information, we will investigate and bring to justice those who place profits over public health.”“Mr. Omidi made millions at the expense of the multiple victim companies he defrauded, and he violated his oath to ‘do no harm’ by callously misleading patients about the need for a sleep study and subsequent weight loss surgery,” said Donald Alway, the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office. “This successful prosecution should send a clear warning to anyone in the medical profession who intends to falsify insurance claims for unnecessary procedures or provide faulty medical advice to patients seeking reliable care.”“Medical providers are in a position of great trust, and this former doctor broke that trust victimizing patients including military service members with medically unnecessary treatment to boost his own profits by hundreds of millions of dollars,” said Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara. “Medical provider fraud is a multi-billion-dollar problem that drives up health insurance premiums and creates a drain on our economy. My Department of Insurance and our law enforcement partners are committed to investigating fraud and protecting consumers and the health care system.”Omidi is a former dermatologist whose medical license was revoked in 2009 after state authorities found he had engaged in dishonesty and unprofessional conduct related to his application for his California medical license.He controlled, in part, the GET THIN network of entities, including SCM, that focused on the promotion and performance of Lap-Band weight-loss surgeries. Omidi established procedures requiring prospective Lap-Band patients – even those with insurance plans he knew would never cover Lap-Band surgery – to have at least one sleep study, and employees were incentivized with commissions to make sure the studies occurred.Omidi used the sleep studies to find a reason – the “co-morbidity” of obstructive sleep apnea – that GET THIN would use to convince the patient’s insurance company to pre-approve the Lap-Band procedure.After patients underwent sleep studies – irrespective of whether any doctor had ever determined the study was medically necessary – GET THIN employees, acting at Omidi’s direction, often falsified the results. Omidi then used the falsified sleep study results in support of GET THIN’s pre-authorization requests for Lap-Band surgery.Relying on the false sleep studies – as well as other false information, including patients’ weights – insurance companies authorized payment for some of the proposed Lap-Band surgeries. Moreover, even if the insurance company did not authorize the surgery, GET THIN still was able to submit bills for approximately $15,000 for each sleep study. Prosecutors estimate that Omidi’s conduct caused insurers and Tricare to pay at least approximately $41 million for Lap-Band procedures, sleep studies, and CPAP devices and accessories tainted by this fraud.The victim health care benefit programs include Tricare, Anthem Blue Cross, UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Health Net, Operating Engineers Health and Welfare Trust Fund, and others.“Today, marks the end of the appalling chapter of Julian Omidi and 1-800-GET-THIN. Omidi was well educated; he had every opportunity to be successful and make ethical decisions. However, driven by greed, he committed some of the most unconscionable and atrocious acts,” said Tyler Hatcher, Special Agent in Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation's Los Angeles Field Office. “There are no words strong enough to describe the actions taken by Omidi. We hope this sentencing brings some closure to all the victims affected by Omidi and 1-800-GET-THIN. IRS Criminal Investigations is committed to using our financial expertise to bring down people and organizations that take advantage of our community and cause irreparable harm.”In 2014, the government seized more than $110 million in funds and securities from accounts held by individuals and entities involved in the criminal scheme, including Omidi. The government is seeking a money judgment order of forfeiture against defendants Omidi and SCM in the amount of $98,280,221 and is pursuing civil forfeiture of the seized property totaling $107,539,422.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations; the FBI; the Defense Criminal Investigative Service; IRS Criminal Investigation; and the California Department of Insurance investigated this matter.Assistant United States Attorneys Kristen A. Williams, Ali Moghaddas, and David H. Chao of the Major Frauds Section, and Assistant United States Attorney David C. Lachman of the Terrorism and Export Crimes Section prosecuted this case. Assistant United States Attorney James E. Dochterman of the Asset Forfeiture and Recovery Section is handling the asset forfeiture portion of this case.ContactCiaran McEvoyPublic Information Officerciaran.mcevoy@usdoj.gov(213) 894-4465Updated April 18, 2023________________________________________TopicsHEALTH CARE FRAUDIDENTITY THEFTComponentUSAO - California, CentralPress Release Number: 23-081"

SARMs are synthetic chemicals designed to mimic the effects of testosterone and other anabolic steroids.  SARMs are “new drugs” under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and therefore not approved for sale.  Little knew the SARMs products were not FDA approved.Little manufactured his SARMs products at a business in Nampa.  There, he processed the bulk ingredients he imported from China—encapsulating, bottling, and preparing them for shipment.  To avoid government seizures of SARMs shipped to other countries, Little offered a stealth shipping option for an additional fee that intentionally mispackaged and falsely declared SARMs shipments as vitamins and supplements.  Law enforcement made multiple undercover purchases of SARMs products from SARMTECH, including products containing Ostarine (MK-2866), Ligandrol (LGD-4033), and other SARMs compounds.  Between March 2018 and January 2022, little sold at least $4,499,197.46 of SARMs products.Little is scheduled to be sentenced on July 11, 2023 and faces a maximum penalty of three years in federal prison.  A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.“I am grateful to the team of attorneys and law enforcement agents who unraveled this illegal and dangerous scheme,” said U.S. Attorney Hurwit.  “We are committed to protecting the public from those who sell unapproved drugs, especially when the ingredients used are imported from China without any way to verify their safety.”“Unapproved drugs that are sold online present serious risks to consumers,” said Special Agent in Charge Robert M. Iwanicki, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office.  “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those whose actions threaten the public health.”U.S. Attorney Hurwit credited the cooperative efforts of the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, Homeland Security Investigations, and the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security Office of Export Enforcement, which led to the charges.###ContactCASSIE FULGHUMPublic Information Officer(208) 334-1211TopicsDRUG TRAFFICKINGHEALTH CARE FRAUDComponentsU.S. Attorneys (USAO)USAO - Idaho"

Adams, 38, of Whitestown, has been sentenced to 3 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to tampering with consumer products.According to court documents, from October 1, 2018, to February 18, 2020, Jennifer Adams repeatedly tampered with vials of injectable pain medications, including fentanyl, morphine, hydromorphone, and ketamine, while employed as a registered nurse in the emergency department at Franciscan Health in Crawfordsville, Indiana.Using an automated medication dispensing machine, Adams gained access to the medications without authorization and used them herself. To conceal her scheme, she refilled the vials of medicine with saline solution and super glued the lids back on. Adams used the saline solution on thirty to forty unknowing patients who had been admitted to the emergency department and were in need of pain relief. The investigation found that Adams tampered with between two and seven vials of medicine during each shift that she worked.“Emergency room patients depend on healthcare providers to give them the medicines they need. This defendant abused her position of trust to steal powerful prescription pain medications and give patients saline instead,” said Zachary A. Myers, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana. “Substance use disorders are serious diseases impacting everyone, including nurses, and medically approved treatment is critical to saving lives and careers. That’s why my office worked with the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division to secure a settlement agreement to ensure that Hoosier nurses can have access to medication assisted treatment while participating in the Indiana State Nursing Assistance Program. I encourage all providers struggling with substance abuse to seek help, because stealing medications from patients is a serious crime that carries serious consequences.”“Health care professionals who take needed medications from patients not only harm patients but also put at risk the trust that U.S. consumers have in those who provide their medical care,” said Special Agent in Charge Ronne Malham, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Chicago Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice health care professionals who tamper with patients’ medications.”“Most health care workers are heroes and work very hard to save lives, but when one person decides to abuse this power, patients suffer tremendously,” Attorney General Rokita said. “This is unacceptable. We should be able to trust our doctors and nurses and not have to worry about tampered medication. I applaud the work of the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit for seeking justice for Hoosiers.”The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations and the Indiana Attorney General’s Office, Medicaid Fraud Control Unit investigated this case. The sentence was imposed by U.S. District Court Judge James P. Hanlon. Judge Hanlon also ordered that Adams be supervised by the U.S. Probation Office for 3 years following her release from federal prison and pay a $1,000 fine.U.S. Attorney Myers thanked Assistant United States Attorney Matthew B.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of Rhode IslandFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, April 5, 2023PROVIDENCE, R.I. – A registered nurse and nurse practitioner, who defrauded commercial health insurers and Medicare of nearly $12 million by devising and executing fraudulent billing schemes in three states seeking payment for patient services that were never performed, has been sentenced to seven years in federal prison, announced United States Attorney Zachary A. Cunha.Alexander A. Istomin, 57, pleaded guilty in October 2022 to an eleven-count Information charging him with health care fraud, mail fraud, aggravated identity theft, and causing the introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce. Istomin admitted that he routinely submitted fraudulent claims for in-person patient services that he did not perform, including supposed patient visits at a “ghost office” in Rhode Island and at offices in Florida and New York. Istomin used seven different tax identification numbers while defrauding eight insurers out of a total of $11,923,686.30.The “ghost office” was an address that Istomin maintained in East Greenwich, Rhode Island, that he claimed was part of his medical practice when, in fact, he used the location solely for the purpose of receiving mail, including fraudulently obtained insurance payments.“By billing for services that he never performed, including at a Rhode Island location that was little more than a mail drop, Alexander Istomin thought he could make off with millions in taxpayer and insurance dollars that were meant to fund real medical care, for real people, all without consequence,” remarked U.S. Attorney Zachary Cunha.  “He was very much mistaken. The sentence imposed reflects both this Office’s commitment to bring to justice individuals who perpetrate this kind of brazen fraud and abuse of our health care system and should serve notice of the consequences for those who seek to enrich themselves through schemes like these.”\"The Office of Inspector General will continue to fervently pursue those who defraud the Medicare system.  Greed, at the expense of our most vulnerable citizens, will not be tolerated,\" said Phillip M. Coyne, Special Agent in Charge for the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “Today’s sentencing is a strong reminder that we will spare no resource to bring to justice those that undermine the integrity of our federal health care system and those served by it.”“Alexander Istomin went to great lengths to conceal his multi-state, multi-million-dollar health care fraud scheme, billing for services he never provided and patients he never saw. With the proceeds of his illegally gotten gains, he bought a million-dollar home in Florida and expensive cars. This sentence is more than just, given that this is not the first time Mr. Istomin has been accused of health care fraud, nor is it his first brush with the law,” said Joseph R. Bonavolonta, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Boston Division. “The unscrupulous tactics he used to steal from taxpayers is what drives our investigators to combat healthcare fraud. After all, these taxpayer-funded programs are designed to provide essential medical services to the elderly and disadvantaged, not to enrich corrupt health care professionals and other fraudsters.”According to documents and information provided to the court, in many instances, patients that Istomin claimed he met with in person were, in fact, out of the country at the time of the supposed visits. On other occasions that Istomin claimed to have been seeing patients, he himself was either in a different state or another country, often visiting his native Russia.As part of his schemes, Istomin waived copayments for some Medicare patients, despite being aware that waiving copayments is prohibited. He did so to induce his patients not to report his fraudulent billing to Medicare. Additionally, Istomin used patient names and information to get prescriptions filled at various pharmacies and be returned to him. Istomin then distributed those drugs to individuals other than those in whose names the prescriptions were filled.On Tuesday, U.S. District Court Chief Judge John J. McConnell, Jr., sentenced Istomin to 84 months of incarceration to be followed by three years of federal supervised release; to pay a fine of $30,000; and to pay restitution to Medicare and private insurers totaling $11,923,686.30.The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Dulce Donovan, with the assistance of Assistant U.S. Attorneys Milind M. Shah and Mary Rogers.The matter was investigated the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General; Federal Bureau of Investigation; and the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations.###Topic(s):Health Care FraudComponent(s):Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)USAO - Rhode IslandContact:Jim Martin (401) 709-5357Press Release Number:23-37"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of MassachusettsFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, April 5, 2023CEO, COO, and Director of Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs ChargedBOSTON – The former CEO, COO, and Director of Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs for Magellan Diagnostics, Inc. (Magellan), a medical device company headquartered in Billerica, Mass., have been charged in connection with concealing a device malfunction that allegedly produced inaccurately low lead test results for tens of thousands of children and other patients.Amy Winslow, 51, of Needham Heights, Mass.; Hossein Maleknia, 64, of Bonita Springs, Fla.; and Reba Daoust, 66, of Amesbury, Mass., were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud; wire fraud; conspiracy to defraud an agency of the United States; and introduction of misbranded medical devices into interstate commerce with intent to defraud and mislead. Winslow and Daoust will make an initial appearance in federal court in Boston later today. Maleknia is expected to make an initial appearance in federal court in Tampa later today.Magellan’s devices – LeadCare Ultra, LeadCare II and LeadCare Plus – detected lead levels and lead poisoning in the blood of children and adults using either venous (i.e., blood draws through the arm) or fingerstick samples. LeadCare II, which was predominantly used to test fingerstick samples, accounted for more than half of all blood lead tests conducted in the United States from 2013 through 2017. LeadCare Plus and LeadCare Ultra were predominantly used to test venous samples.According to the indictment, Winslow, Maleknia and Daoust – Magellan’s former CEO, COO, and Director of Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs, respectively – repeatedly misled Magellan customers and the FDA about a serious malfunction that affected Magellan’s LeadCare devices when they were used to test venous blood samples. By allegedly hiding the malfunction and later deceiving customers and the FDA about when they discovered the malfunction, the nature, extent and frequency of the malfunction, and the risks associated with the malfunction, the defendants caused an estimated tens of thousands of children and other patients to receive inaccurately low lead test results.“According to the CDC, there is no safe level of lead in the blood. Additionally, young children and pregnant mothers from low-income households living in public housing are the most vulnerable to lead exposure. We allege that these defendants deceived customers and the FDA about the reliability of medical tests that detected lead levels. By doing so, we assert that they endangered the health and lives of incredibly vulnerable victims,” said United States Attorney Rachael S. Rollins. “This office, along with our other law enforcement partners, will vigorously investigate and prosecute those who put corporate profits before patient health. Here, we allege the personal gain is at the expense of poor people, children, and individuals who are pregnant. We pledge to advocate on these victims’ behalf and hold bad corporate actors accountable.”“Individuals and companies whose lead testing devices provide inaccurate results can put the health of all patients, and especially vulnerable children, at significant risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Fernando P. McMillan, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations New York Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who jeopardize the health of patients and the public.”“Today, we arrested three former senior executives at Magellan Diagnostics for hiding a serious flaw in the lead testing devices the company produced, resulting in inaccurate test results for tens of thousands of children and other patients. We believe these executives knew about this malfunction for years, but failed to come clean to their customers and the FDA about it in order to boost their company’s bottom line,” said Joseph R. Bonavolonta, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Division. “The last thing sick children and their parents should have to worry about is whether diagnostic tests and devices live up to their manufacturer’s claims. This case should make it crystal clear to all companies that do business in Massachusetts, healthcare or otherwise, that they will be brought to justice for misleading consumers with false promises about their products.”“Concealing the fact that a device is producing inaccurate lead test results to boost profits while knowing that there is no safe level of lead in the blood, as alleged in this case, is a brazen disregard to the health and safety of our program beneficiaries,” said Phillip M. Coyne, Special Agent in Charge for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General. “Today’s arrests should serve as strong reminder that we will never tolerate such behavior that puts patients at risk.”It is alleged that the defendants first learned that a malfunction in their LeadCare Ultra device could cause inaccurate lead test results –specifically, lead test results that were falsely low – during the FDA clearance process in or around June 2013. The defendants, however, allegedly released LeadCare Ultra to the market in December 2013 without informing customers or the FDA of the malfunction. Several months after the release, LeadCare Ultra customers independently discovered the malfunction and complained about inaccurate results. It is further alleged that the defendants drafted and caused Magellan to provide false and misleading statements to customers that they “recently identified cases” of the malfunction and they did not observe the malfunction “in our clinical trials prior to the product release.” According to court documents, the defendants, in fact, had known about the malfunction for over a year, including before the product release.Magellan’s testing in 2013 also indicated that the same malfunction affected the LeadCare II device, which was by far Magellan’s highest-revenue product. Winslow and Maleknia, however, were positioning Magellan for sale, which could have been put in jeopardy if there was a malfunction affecting LeadCare II. It is alleged that Winslow told a Magellan employee to stop studying the malfunction in LeadCare II devices because Magellan needed to maintain “plausible deniability.” Only after Magellan was acquired by Meridian Bioscience, Inc. for $66 million in March 2016, did the defendants notify customers and the FDA about the LeadCare II malfunction. Magellan’s report to the FDA about LeadCare II allegedly made materially false and misleading statements and concealed material facts about Magellan’s discovery of the malfunction in LeadCare II (after Meridian acquired Magellan, Winslow received a bonus of approximately $2 million and Maleknia received a bonus of approximately $448,000).According to court documents, the defendants delayed notifying the FDA and then misled the FDA about the malfunction. The defendants only filed an FDA report for LeadCare Ultra after an outside consultant told Magellan that if they did not notify the FDA about the malfunction, the consultant would. In 2017, the FDA contacted Magellan and asked when the company first discovered the malfunction. It is alleged that, at Daoust and Maleknia’s instruction, Magellan’s representative falsely told the FDA that Magellan first discovered the problem after receiving customer complaints in late 2014 and shortly before Magellan notified the FDA in 2015 – even though Magellan actually discovered the malfunction almost four years earlier, in 2013. Winslow also caused Magellan to send a false timeline to the FDA, which omitted the company’s internal 2013 studies about the malfunction.The FDA ultimately found that the LeadCare Devices could not accurately test venous samples, leading to a recall of all LeadCare Devices using venous samples and a warning to the public not to use LeadCare Ultra, LeadCare II and LeadCare Plus for venous blood samples because of the malfunction.According to court documents, as referenced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there is no safe level of lead in the blood. Lead exposure may cause irreversible lifelong physical and mental health problems. Young children and pregnant women are most vulnerable to lead exposure, especially those from low-income households and those who live in housing built before 1978 because those homes are more likely to contain lead-based paint and have fixtures containing lead.If you or a family member believe you received an inaccurate blood lead test result from a LeadCare device between 2013-2017, please complete the questionnaire located on the FBI’s website at www.fbi.gov/MagellanCaseInquiry. Information about the status of the case is located on the U.S. Attorney’s Office website https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/press-highlights.The charges of wire fraud and wire fraud conspiracy as alleged in the indictment provide for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, up to three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. The charge of conspiracy to defraud an agency of the United States provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, up to three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. The charges of introduction of misbranded medical devices provide for a sentence of up to three years in prison, up to one year of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeNorthern District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, March 30, 2023Latest Tranche of Sentencings Includes Lead Defendants in Drug Diversion ConspiracySAN FRANCISCO – On Thursday, March 23, 2023, and Friday, March 24, 2023, the federal court entered judgment against fourteen defendants, including cousins and ringleaders Mihran Stepanyan and Artur Stepanyan, who were sentenced for their respective roles in a variety of crimes stemming from a wide-ranging racketeering conspiracy involving diversion of prescription drugs, money laundering, mail and wire fraud, and additional crimes, announced United States Attorney Ismail J. Ramsey; Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge Robert K. Tripp; and Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation, Special Agent in Charge Darren Lian. The sentences were handed down by the Hon. Charles R. Breyer, Senior United States District Judge, and leaves nine defendants remaining to be sentenced for crimes committed in connection with the case.The fourteen defendants had been charged with various crimes as part of a Second Superseding Indictment filed on February 11, 2016. The Second Superseding indictment alleged that 38 defendants were involved with the activities of a nationwide conspiracy, referred to in court documents as the Karapedyan-Stepanyan Enterprise (Enterprise), that engaged in, among other crimes, a multi-million-dollar prescription drug diversion scheme, a tax fraud and Treasury check scheme, and several other criminal schemes. Information about charges brought earlier in the case can be found here and information about several defendants’ guilty pleas can be found here.The Prescription Drug Diversion SchemeLast week, seven defendants were sentenced for their respective roles in the prescription drug diversion scheme. Among them were four of the principal actors in the Enterprise: Mihran Stepanyan, 37, of Glendale, Calif., Artur Stepanyan, 45, both of Glendale, Calif., Yan German (a.k.a., Henrik Harutyunyan), 43, of Encino, and Arman Zargayan, 40, of Granada Hills, Calif. All four defendants pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d).The prescription drug diversion scheme had nationwide reach; indeed, a separate investigation resulted in another indictment filed on May 6, 2015, in the Southern District of Ohio. That indictment charged the Stepanyans and others with various crimes arising from their sale of illicitly procured drugs and was transferred to the Northern District of California and consolidated with the instant case.Court documents describe how the Enterprise took advantage of a “robust black market involving the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs.” According to the government’s filings, prescription drugs were procured illicitly at below market value and then were resold and re-introduced into the market as legitimate drugs at near-market prices. Illicit procurement can involve stealing drugs from manufacturers; buying drugs from patients with prescriptions at below-market prices (the patients’ costs are offset or reduced by insurance, including Medicare); buying drugs using false prescriptions and straw patients, usually with the aid of a corrupt doctor (again, with the costs offset or reduced by insurance); and purchasing drugs from a manufacturer at a discounted price through fraud, e.g., falsely claiming a charitable or similar discount. These “diverted” prescription drugs often are cleaned or repackaged to make them appear legitimate. Each of the defendants sentenced pleaded guilty to crimes in accordance with their participation in the crimes of the Enterprise. Each defendant’s plea agreement describes the role that the defendant played in the drug diversion scheme.According to their plea agreements, Artur and Mirhan Stepanyan obtained illicit prescription drugs from a network of unlicensed drug suppliers and supplied the drugs to co-conspirators at deep discounts. The Stepanyans were responsible for nearly $200 million in sales to their co-defendants who sold the drugs to customers throughout the United States. The defendants used fraudulent documents to establish the pedigree of the drugs they sold. In addition, the Stepanyans sold prescription drugs to their co-defendants in California, although they were not licensed to do so. Starting as early as 2009, the Stepanyans sold tens of millions of dollars in diverted prescription drugs per year to their codefendants. The Stepanyans incorporated multiple entities in Nevada, including Panda Capital Group, Trans Atlantic Capital Group, and Red Rock Capital Group and in 2012, the Stepanyans began doing business as GC National Wholesale. The Stepanyans were paid more than $160 million for diverted drugs—typically at prices ranging from 15% to 25% off the Wholesale Acquisition Cost (“WAC”) established by manufacturers of prescription drugs. For their respective parts in the conspiracy, Mihran Stepanyan was sentenced to 60 months in prison and Artur Stepanyan, was sentenced to 54 months in prison.German was sentenced to 23 months in prison for his role in the scheme. German admitted he was one of the suppliers of pharmaceutical drugs for the Stepanyans. According to his plea agreement, German admitted he engaged in a wire fraud and money laundering as part of the Enterprise and that he was involve in a separate prescription drug diversion and check cashing scheme with co-defendant Ara Karapedyan. German also acknowledged the loss amount for which he is responsible is between $9.5 and $25 million.Zargayan was sentenced to 35 months in prison for his role in the scheme. Zargayan operated a California-licensed drug wholesale company, Nuvo Pharmaceuticals, with an unindicted co-conspirator. Zargayan admitted that he used Nuvo Pharmaceuticals as a front for the drugs that a company called ME Wholesale sold to LLC Wholesale from May to August 2013. Nuvo Pharmaceuticals was licensed in California, but it did not actually supply the drugs that ME Wholesale sold. In addition, the pedigrees for ME Wholesale’s drugs falsely claimed that Nuvo Pharmaceuticals had received the drugs from McKesson.Fraudulent Check SchemeAlso sentenced last week were seven defendants, all California residents, in connection with attempts to negotiate over 500 fraudulent checks issued to a variety of payees and totaling more than $5 million. A substantial number of the fraudulent checks were tax refund checks sent by mail by the United States Treasury and many of these tax refund checks had been issued based on fraudulent tax returns filed with the Internal Revenue Service. The defendants acquired and possessed identifying information for dozens of individuals, which was used to file fraudulent tax returns online. Associates of the Enterprise negotiated numerous fraudulent checks through a business owned by one of the co-conspirators—a service that was offered in exchange for a percentage of the proceeds.In sum, of the 38 defendants charged in the February 2016 Superseding Indictment, 33 have been convicted and nine remain to be sentenced. The charges against five defendants have been dismissed. Judge Breyer scheduled two additional hearings for May 31, 2023, at which time co-defendants Asatour Magzanyan and Loui Artin are scheduled to be sentenced.Assistant United States Attorneys Claudia Quiroz, Andrew Dawson, and Chris Kaltsas are prosecuting the case with the assistance of Kevin Costello. The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the FBI, the IRS, the FDA, and USPIS.________________________________________ComponentUSAO - California, Northern"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASETuesday, March 28, 2023SAN DIEGO – Otilio Rodriguez Toledo and Alicia Aispuro Hernandez, husband and wife from Thermal, California, pleaded guilty in federal court today to conspiring to smuggle and distribute $2 million worth of Mexican pesticides and veterinary drugs that are not approved for use in the United States.In pleading guilty, the defendants acknowledged that since at least December of 2018, they had been engaged in smuggling pesticides and veterinary drugs from Mexico into the United States, and then distributing them within the United States. The pesticides involved were primarily Taktic and Bovitraz, which are not registered with the EPA for use in the United States. The smuggled veterinary drugs included Tetragent Aves, Metabolase, Terramicina, Cipio Vet, Baytril Max, Tylovet, Caterrol, Penicilina, and Tylosma, which are not approved by the FDA for use in the United States.In pleading guilty, the defendants admitted that the smuggled pesticides and veterinary drugs were brought in through the Calexico Port of Entry in Imperial County and placed in storage units near the border. The smugglers would send photographs of the products at the storage units as proof of delivery.The defendants admitted they later picked up the products from the storage units and distributed them to others within the United States. As part of their plea agreement, the defendants agreed that the value of the smuggled goods was more than $1 million but less than $2.2 million and further agreed that the government could seek the forfeiture of up to $2.2 million in proceeds obtained from the sale of the smuggled goods.According to experts at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and elsewhere, the active ingredient in the pesticides Taktic and Bovitraz is amitraz, which is toxic to bees and humans if it is released into hives and ultimately ends up in honey, honeycomb and beeswax.Misuse of amitraz-containing products in beehives can result in exposures that could cause neurological effects and possibly reproductive effects in humans from the consumption of contaminated honey. Signs of neurotoxicity from exposure to amitraz has been documented in multiple animal species, including central nervous system depression, decrease in pulse rate, and hypothermia.“These rules are in place to protect animals, people and the environment from harmful pesticides and drugs,” said U.S. Attorney Randy Grossman. “Public safety is our top priority and we intend to enforce those laws.” Grossman thanked the prosecution team and investigators on the case who relentlessly pursued the leaders of this smuggling organization.“The defendants in this case smuggled illegal and hazardous chemicals into the United States for profit knowing they were banned and posed a significant health and safety threat to humans, wildlife and the environment,” said Chad Plantz, Special Agent in Charge, HSI San Diego. “This guilty plea highlights HSI’s steadfast commitment to working with our partners to pursue, arrest, and bring to justice anyone who threatens the well-being of our communities.“The FDA regulates animal drugs as part of its mission to protect the public health, which includes ensuring that prescription animal drugs are lawfully distributed and dispensed pursuant to a valid prescription,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Brian G. McClune, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Kansas City Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who attempt to evade the law.”“The defendants’ conduct put consumers at risk,” said Scot Adair, Special Agent in Charge of the EPA’s criminal enforcement program in California. “The pesticides they attempted to distribute were smuggled into the United States from Mexico and are illegally used in beehives. The defendants in this case made millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains through the illegal sale of this unregistered pesticide.”The defendants are scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge John A. Houston on June 21,2023 at 10 a.m. This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Melanie K.

Kavanaugh of the Western District of Virginia said today. “In this case, millions of dollars were obtained from the illegal distribution of veterinary medicine and, just like pharmaceuticals intended for human-use, my Office will continue to hold accountable those companies and corporations that violate federal law.”“The FDA regulates animal drugs as part of its mission to protect the public health. Part of this responsibility includes ensuring that prescription animal drugs are lawfully distributed and dispensed pursuant to a valid prescription,” said Special Agent in Charge George A. Scavdis, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who attempt to evade the law.”According to court documents, from 2011-2021, Midwest shipped prescription drugs from their non-pharmacy locations throughout the United States to end-users that were not authorized to receive prescription drugs. Shipments from non-pharmacy locations to end-users and shipments to non-authorized locations are deemed misbranded. Midwest shipped at least $10,150,014 worth of misbranded drugs to end-users between 2011-2021. The law violated is designed, in part, to ensure that prescription drugs are kept within a controlled chain of distribution to prevent diversion and inappropriate use.As part of the plea agreement, Midwest will forfeit $10,150,014 and serve between one and three years’ probation. Midwest will also pay $1,000,000 to the Virginia Department of Health Professions, and a $500,000 fine.

The defendant injected himself with Fentanyl and Morphine from the vials and disguised his theft of the drugs by refilling the vials with saline solution. The defendant acted with reckless disregard by placing the tampered-with vials back into service, which put Baptist Ambulance patients in danger of bodily injury, and under the circumstances, manifested extreme indifference to this risk.“Our office is committed to protecting the health and safety our citizens,” said United States Attorney Clay Joyner. “Actions like the ones committed by the defendant place citizens in grave danger of harm and bodily injury and cannot be tolerated.”“Patients rely on the knowledge that they will receive FDA-approved medications to manage their conditions,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin Fielder, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Miami Field Office. “When health care professionals tamper with those needed medications, we will pursue and bring them to justice.”The FDA Office of Inspector General investigated the case, working with Priority Ambulance Diversion Task Force.Assistant U.S. Attorney Philip Levy prosecuted the case.________________________________________TopicsPRESCRIPTION DRUGSComponentUSAO - Mississippi, Northern"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of New YorkFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, March 9, 2023Medical Device Company Admitted Wrongdoing and Entered into Non-Prosecution Agreement Requiring $10 Million Monetary Penalty and Ongoing Compliance MeasuresDamian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Michael J. Driscoll, the Assistant Director in Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), and Fernando P. McMillan, the Special Agent in Charge of the New York Field Office of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration – Office of Criminal Investigations (“FDA-OCI”), announced today the filing of a two-count Indictment (the “Indictment”) charging Laura PERRYMAN, the former Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of STIMWAVE LLC, a Florida-based medical device company, in connection with a scheme to create and sell a non-functioning dummy medical device for implantation into patients suffering from chronic pain, resulting in millions of dollars in losses to federal healthcare programs.  PERRYMAN was arrested this morning in Delray Beach, Florida, and will be presented later today in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.In addition, Mr. Williams announced the unsealing of a non-prosecution agreement (the “Agreement”) with STIMWAVE LLC (\"STIMWAVE\"), which filed for bankruptcy on June 15, 2022.  The Agreement was entered into on October 29, 2022, and was sealed by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, pending the Government’s ongoing investigation.  Under the terms of the Agreement, STIMWAVE has accepted responsibility for its conduct by, among other things: (i) making admissions and stipulating to the accuracy of an extensive Statement of Facts; (ii) paying a $10,000,000 monetary penalty; and (iii) maintaining an adequate compliance program, to include employing a Chief Compliance Officer and holding regular compliance committee meetings.  STIMWAVE is also required to cooperate fully with the Government.  STIMWAVE’s obligations under the Agreement will continue for a period of three years from the date of execution of the Agreement.The U.S. Attorney’s Office also unsealed a civil fraud lawsuit filed against STIMWAVE under the False Claims Act (“FCA”), and the parties’ settlement of that suit (the “FCA Settlement”).  The settlement has been submitted to United States District Judge George B. Daniels for approval.  In connection with the FCA Settlement, STIMWAVE admitted and accepted responsibility for conduct alleged in the Government’s civil complaint and agreed to pay $8,600,000 to the United States.  This payment will be credited towards the $10,000,000 monetary penalty discussed above.  The civil complaint also brings claims against PERRYMAN under the FCA, which are pending.U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “As alleged, at the direction of its founder and CEO Laura Perryman, Stimwave created a dummy medical device component — made entirely of plastic — designed to be implanted in patients for the sole purpose of causing doctors to unwittingly bill Medicare and private insurance companies more than $16,000 for each implantation of the piece of plastic.  The defendant and Stimwave did this so that they could charge medical providers many thousands of dollars for purchasing their medical device.  Our Office will continue to do everything in its power to bring to justice anyone responsible for perpetuating health care fraud, which in this case led to patients being used as nothing more than tools for financial enrichment.”FBI Assistant Director Michael J. Driscoll said: “Ms. Perryman, as the Chief Executive Officer of Stimwave, allegedly led a scheme to sell medical devices that contained a non-functioning component that doctors unwittingly implanted into patients suffering from chronic pain.  As a result of her illegal actions, not only did patients undergo unnecessary implanting procedures, but Medicare was defrauded of millions of dollars.  Today’s action demonstrates the FBI’s continuing commitment to protect Medicare and other government programs from financial fraud and abuse.”FDA-OCI Special Agent in Charge Fernando P. McMillan said: “Individuals and companies that manufacture and distribute medical devices with non-functional components put the health of patients at significant risk.  We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who jeopardize the health of their patients and of the public.”According to the documents unsealed today in Manhattan federal court and the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware:[1]STIMWAVE was a medical device company that manufactured and distributed implantable neurostimulation devices designed to treat intractable, chronic pain.  Founded in 2010 by PERRYMAN and others, STIMWAVE was headquartered in Pompano Beach, Florida.STIMWAVE was founded on the premise that its products would provide non-opioid alternatives to chronic pain management.  As the founder and CEO of STIMWAVE, PERRYMAN oversaw the design of the StimQ PNS System (the “Device”), a neurostimulator medical device that treated chronic pain by producing electrical currents to target peripheral nerves outside the spinal cord.  From at least in or about 2017 up to and including her termination in or about 2019, PERRYMAN, as STIMWAVE’s CEO, engaged in a multi-year scheme (the “Scheme”) to design, create, manufacture, and market an inert, non-functioning component of the Device — called the “White Stylet” — that served no medical purpose but was included with the Device through in or about 2020 in order to make the product financially viable for doctors to purchase.When STIMWAVE originally brought the Device to market in or about 2017, it contained three primary components: (i) an implantable electrode array (the “Lead”) that stimulated the nerve; (ii) an externally worn battery that sat outside the body and wirelessly provided power to the Lead through the patient’s skin (the “Battery”); and (iii) a separate implantable receiver measuring approximately 23 centimeters in length with a distinctive pink handle — called the “Pink Stylet.”  The Pink Stylet contained copper and, unlike the White Stylet, functioned as a receiver to transmit energy from the Battery to the Lead.STIMWAVE sold the Device to doctors and medical providers for over approximately $16,000.  Medical insurance providers, including Medicare, would reimburse medical practitioners for implanting the Device into patients through two separate reimbursement codes, one for implantation of the Lead and a second for implantation of the Pink Stylet.  The billing code for implanting the Lead provided for reimbursement at a rate of between approximately $4,000 and $6,000, while the billing code for implanting a receiver, like the Pink Stylet, provided for reimbursement at a rate of between approximately $16,000 and $18,000.Soon after the Device was released, physicians informed STIMWAVE that they were having trouble implanting the Pink Stylet in certain patients because the Pink Stylet was too long.  STIMWAVE and PERRYMAN knew that the Pink Stylet could not be cut or trimmed to shorten it without interfering with the functionality of the Pink Stylet as a receiver, and without a receiver component for doctors to implant and seek reimbursement for, doctors would incur a substantial financial loss with every purchase of the Device, thereby making it more difficult for STIMWAVE to sell the Device to doctors and medical providers at the approximately $16,000 price.However, STIMWAVE — at the direction of PERRYMAN — did not lower the price of the Device so that its cost to doctors and medical providers could be covered by reimbursement for the implantation of only the Lead, nor did PERRYMAN recommend that doctors not implant the Device or its receiver component in cases where the Pink Stylet could not fit comfortably.  Instead, PERRYMAN directed that STIMWAVE create the White Stylet — a dummy component made entirely of plastic that served no medical purpose but which STIMWAVE misrepresented to doctors as a customizable receiver alternative to the Pink Stylet.  The White Stylet could be cut to size by the doctor for use in smaller anatomical spaces and was created solely so that doctors and medical providers would continue to purchase the Device for use in those scenarios and continue to bill for the implantation of a receiver component.  To perpetuate the lie that the White Stylet was functional, PERRYMAN oversaw training that suggested to doctors that the White Stylet was a “receiver,” when, in fact, it was made entirely of plastic, contained no copper, and therefore had no conductivity.  In addition, PERRYMAN directed other STIMWAVE employees to vouch for the efficacy of the White Stylet, when she knew that the White Stylet was actually non-functional.As a result of these misrepresentations regarding the functionality of the White Stylet, PERRYMAN caused doctors and medical providers to unwittingly implant the non-functional White Stylet into patients and submit fraudulent reimbursement claims for implantation of the White Stylet to Medicare, resulting in millions of dollars in losses to the federal government.On June 15, 2022, STIMWAVE filed for bankruptcy in Delaware under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, through which it sold substantially all of its assets to a third-party through an auction.*                *                *PERRYMAN, 54, of Delray Beach, Florida, has been charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud, which carries a maximum potential sentence of 20 years in prison, and one count of health care fraud, which carries a maximum potential sentence of 10 years in prison.The maximum potential sentences are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the judge.Mr. Williams praised the investigative work of the FBI and thanked the FDA for its assistance.The criminal case is being handled by the Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit of the Office’s Criminal Division.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Louis A. Pellegrino, Jacob M. Bergman, and Mónica P.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of New JerseyFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, February 23, 2023NEWARK, N.J. – A New Jersey doctor today admitted using his medical license – and allowing other to use his medical license – to purchase prescription oncology medications under false pretenses for the purpose of selling them for profit, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced.Joel Lerner, 62, of Warren, New Jersey, a board-certified podiatrist and operator of a medical supply group purchasing organization, pleaded guilty by videoconference before U.S. District Judge Susan D. Wigenton to an information charging him with unlawfully selling prescription cancer medication, which had been previously purchased using his medical license and under the representation that such medication was to be used to treat his patients.According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:While working in his medical practice’s offices in various locations in New Jersey, Lerner was recruited by an individual who owned a pharmacy and also owned and operated two businesses that were wholesale distributors of prescription drugs. At the request of this individual and others working with him, and in return for commissions and discounts on other medical supplies purchased by Lerner for his group purchasing organization, Lerner used his medical license – and allowed others to use it – to purchase expensive prescription drugs, primarily, cold-chain biologic infusion medications that typically are used to treat cancers, macular degeneration, and autoimmune diseases. By recruiting and using Lerner and his medical license to purchase the drugs, these individuals were able to obtain prescription drugs from the pharmaceutical manufacturers’ authorized distributors that they would not otherwise have been permitted to purchase. They were then able to sell them at a profit through their two businesses.In purchasing the drugs, Lerner and the two individuals made numerous false and misleading representations to the pharmaceutical manufacturers and authorized distributors, including that Lerner purchased the drugs to use to treat his patients, and that the drugs would not be resold or redistributed. In actuality, none of the drugs were administered to Lerner’s patients, but were ultimately sold to customers of the two businesses for a profit. In an effort to obscure the fact that he was illegally buying and selling prescription drugs purchased under his medical license, Lerner sold and transferred the prescription drugs in the name of his group purchasing organization. The scheme ran from December 2014 through November 2018, during which more than $1.2 million in prescription drugs were purchased in Lerner’s name and using his medical license.The sale of prescription drugs purchased by a healthcare entity is punishable by a maximum of three years in prison and a $10,000 fine. In his plea agreement, Lerner also agreed to make restitution for the full amount of any loss resulting from his offense. Sentencing is scheduled for July 18, 2023.U.S. Attorney Sellinger credited special agents of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations New York Field Office, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Fernando P. McMillan; and special agents of U.S. Attorney’s Office, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Thomas Mahoney, with the investigation leading to today’s guilty plea.The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Diana Vondra Carrig and Sara A.

        "content": "Illinois Attorney GeneralFor Immediate ReleaseFebruary 16, 2023Chicago– Attorney General Kwame Raoul today announced his office has charged a former Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital employee who allegedly stole and sold approximately 10 tanks of nitrous oxide, a medical gas used as an anesthetic in medical procedures and surgeries.The Attorney General’s office charged Mitchell R. Gunther, 39, of Burbank, Illinois today with one count of burglary, a Class 2 felony punishable by three to seven years in prison; two counts of theft over $500, Class 3 felonies each punishable by two to five years in prison; and two counts of possession of nitrous oxide with the intent to deliver, Class 3 felonies each punishable by two to five years in prison. Gunther’s bond was set at $10,000, and his next court date is scheduled for March 20.“The Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital uses its supply of nitrous oxide to safely perform critical and life-saving surgeries on sick children and teens. It is outrageous that someone would use their access at the hospital and jeopardize vulnerable patients in order to make a personal profit,” Raoul said. “My office is committed to working with federal law enforcement agencies to hold individuals accountable for abusing their positions and endangering others.”According to Raoul, Gunther worked as an assistant in charge of Lurie Children’s Hospital’s medical tank gas supply from June 2020 until March 2022. In October of 2021, another hospital employee observed abnormalities in the medical gas storage room and the gas delivery systems, including tanks missing from storage supply racks and an increase in nitrous oxide deliveries. In March of 2022, Lurie staff deemed the hospital’s supply of nitrous oxide gas as being critical when only one tank remained attached to the hospital’s gas supply. According to Raoul, an investigation revealed video of Gunther on three occasions using his personal vehicle to transport tanks of nitrous oxide outside work hours. Gunther’s employment with Lurie’s was subsequently terminated.Raoul alleges that after being fired by Lurie Children’s Hospital, Gunther traveled to St. Mary’s Hospital on Chicago’s West Side and posed as a nitrous oxide delivery driver for Medox, a gas delivery company Gunther previously was employed by. Raoul alleges Gunther stole two tanks of nitrous oxide from St. Mary’s and replaced them with empty tanks.The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations.“As alleged, this injustice endangered our community’s children and the medical personnel that cared for them,” said Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Field Office of the FBI. “These charges are the first step in ensuring that justice is served, and I am proud of the work done here alongside our partners.”“Diverting medical supplies from the patients who need them causes harm to the patients and to the health care system,” said Special Agent in Charge Ronne G. Malham, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Chicago Field Office. “We commend the efforts of the Illinois Attorney General’s Office for vigorously pursuing the prosecution of this matter.”The public is reminded the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.Deputy Bureau Chief John Brassil is prosecuting the case for Raoul’s Special Prosecutions Bureau.-30-"

LOUIS – A doctor admitted on Friday that he diluted methadone that was dispensed in a St. Francois County, Missouri methadone clinic in 2021.Dr. Sunil G. Chand, 59, pleaded guilty in front of U.S. District Judge Sarah E. Pitlyk to one count of adulterating a drug with the intent to defraud or mislead. He admitted that while the owner of Best Medical LLC, a family medicine clinic in Leadington, Missouri, he added saline and water to bottles of methadone to conceal a shortage of the drug from the Drug Enforcement Administration.Dr. Chand decided in 2020 to open a methadone clinic to treat patients with narcotic use disorders, his plea agreement says. Dr. Chand caused Best Medical to obtain a DEA registration authorizing it to operate as a narcotic treatment program and to store and dispense Schedule II controlled substances, including methadone, to treat patients with narcotic use disorders.On April 6, 2021, the clinic received twelve 1,000 milliliter bottles of methadone oral concentrate. Best Medical's methadone clinic opened the next day, treating patients who came in to receive an oral, liquid dose of methadone.By April 22, Dr. Chand became aware that methadone was missing. Instead of reporting the methadone loss to the DEA within one business day of its discovery, as required, he instructed Best Medical's clinical director several days later to complete and submit a DEA Form 106 to report the loss.Dr. Chand admitted that the form, submitted April 28, inaccurately reported that 1,075 milliliters of methadone had been lost. Dr. Chand then came in on a Sunday, when the clinic was closed, to dilute the methadone, his plea agreement says.As part of the plea agreement, Dr. Chand has also agreed to surrender his DEA registration, which authorized him to prescribe certain controlled substances.Dr. Chand is scheduled to be sentenced May 30. The charge carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison, a $250,000 fine or both.\"As part of our mission, DEA is dedicated to patient safety and oversight of all medical professionals registered with DEA,” said Diversion Program Manager Inez Davis, DEA’s lead for the Diversion program in Missouri, Kansas and southern Illinois. “Dr. Chand abused his authority and public trust by altering controlled substance medications intended for those seeking treatment for substance use disorders. With this acknowledgement of wrongdoing, his patients will no longer be subjected to substandard care.\"“The Food and Drug Administration oversees the U.S. drug supply to ensure that they are safe and effective; those who distribute adulterated drugs may place American consumers at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L.

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, February 3, 2023Food and ingredient manufacturing company Kerry Inc. pleaded guilty today to a charge that it manufactured breakfast cereal under insanitary conditions at a facility in Gridley, Illinois, that was linked to a 2018 salmonellosis outbreak.Pursuant to a plea agreement filed with a criminal information in federal court in Peoria, Illinois, Kerry pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of distributing adulterated cereal marketed as Kellogg’s Honey Smacks. The company also agreed to pay a criminal fine and forfeiture amount totaling $19.228 million. If the guilty plea is accepted by the court, the $19.228 million fine and forfeiture will constitute the largest-ever criminal penalty following a criminal conviction in a food safety case.“Consumers depend on food manufacturers to take appropriate steps to ensure food safety,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department is committed to holding accountable those who fail to meet this obligation.”“Today’s announcement should serve as a reminder that food manufacturers have a critical responsibility to produce and sell food that is safe for American consumers to eat,” said Assistant Commissioner Justin D. Green for the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who put the public health at risk by allowing contaminated foods to enter the U.S. marketplace.”The criminal information unsealed today alleges that Kerry manufactured Kellogg’s Honey Smacks cereal under insanitary conditions and distributed it in violation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. According to the plea agreement, tests performed as part of Kerry’s environmental monitoring program found numerous instances of Salmonella in the environment at the Gridley facility. During the time period June 2016 to June 2018, routine environmental tests detected Salmonella in the plant approximately 81 times, including at least one positive Salmonella sample each month. According to the plea agreement, employees at the Gridley facility routinely failed to implement corrective and preventative actions (CAPAs) to address positive Salmonella tests.In June 2018, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that an ongoing outbreak of salmonellosis cases in the United States could be traced to Kellogg’s Honey Smacks cereal produced at Kerry’s Gridley facility. In response, Kellogg’s voluntarily recalled all Honey Smacks manufactured at the plant since June 2017. The CDC eventually identified more than 130 cases of salmonellosis linked to the outbreak, with illness onset dates beginning in March 2018. The CDC did not identify any deaths related to the outbreak.Salmonellosis can cause symptoms such as diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps that last several days in healthy adults. Absent prompt treatment, salmonellosis can cause severe dehydration and even death in infants, young children, the elderly, transplant recipients, pregnant women, and individuals with weakened immune systems.In a related case, Ravi K. Chermala, Kerry’s Director of Quality Assurance until September 2018, previously pleaded guilty to three misdemeanor counts of causing the introduction of adulterated food into interstate commerce. Chermala oversaw the sanitation programs at various Kerry manufacturing plants, including the Gridley facility. In pleading guilty, Chermala admitted that between June 2016 and June 2018, he directed subordinates not to report certain information to Kellogg’s about conditions at the Gridley facility. In addition, Chermala admitted that he directed subordinates at the Gridley facility to alter the plant’s program for monitoring for the presence of pathogens in the plant, limiting the facility’s ability to accurately detect insanitary conditions. Chermala is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 16.The court set a March 14 sentencing date for Kerry. Further information about the Kerry and Chermala cases will be posted to the Department’s Information for Victims in Large Cases website at https://www.justice.gov/largecases.FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations is investigating the matter.Senior Trial Attorney James T.

Carballo-Cabrera, María Santos-Carballo, and Magnetic Healer of PR Inc. with conspiracy and introduction of adulterated and misbranded devices with intent to defraud and mislead, conspiracy to commit mail fraud, and alteration of a device after shipment in interstate commerce.According to court documents, the defendants unlawfully enriched themselves and operated the company Magnetic Healer of PR Inc. to sell devices containing magnets (“healing magnets”) which were advertised as being effective in the cure, mitigation, treatment, and prevention of diseases in humans, which included COVID-19, migraines, depression, insomnia, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, autism, and cancer, among others. The indictment alleges that the defendants generated proceeds from the unlawful sale of the devices, which were adulterated and misbranded for purposes of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA) and seeks the forfeiture of a money judgment totaling $327,047.56.One purpose of the FDCA is to ensure that devices and drugs sold to prevent, cure, or treat diseases are safe and effective for their intended uses and bear labeling that contain true and accurate information and have adequate directions for use. The FDCA prohibits, among other things, the knowing introduction and delivery in interstate commerce of a device that is misbranded or adulterated.The devices that the defendants sold were misbranded under the FDCA because the defendants marketed and sold devices without notifying and obtaining the necessary approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The lack of approval from the FDA also made the devices adulterated for purposes of the FDCA. Furthermore, the devices were misbranded because their the labeling was false and misleading; the labeling failed to bear adequate directions for use; and the labeling lacked adequate warnings.The defendants obtained parts for the devices via the mail from vendors outside of Puerto Rico and assembled the devices in Puerto Rico. They promoted the devices on social media and websites, including www.elbertoberdut.com and www.magneticbiotherapy.com. The defendants falsely claimed that the devices did not require FDA approval, had been submitted for FDA approval, and were FDA Authorized, using an official “FDA authorized” logo. The defendants sold the devices via the same websites and at the company’s physical address in San Juan, Puerto Rico.Elberto Berdut-Teruel was the president, secretary, treasurer, and resident agent of Magnetic Healer of PR Inc.

McHugh on one count of obstruction of justice, arising from his creation and submission of false and fictitious medical records and doctor’s letters, and causing them to be submitted to the District Court, in an effort to keep him from having to stand trial on separate felony charges.In August 2021, Merlino was under indictment and awaiting trial on a felony misbranding charge for selling a toxic chemical as a weight-loss drug online.  Merlino and caused fraudulent submissions to the trial court, by altering a doctor’s letters and altering legitimate medical records.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeNorthern District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, January 27, 2023After two-week trial, federal jury found Miller and his company both guilty of conspiracies involving racketeering, mail and wire fraud, and money laundering, in addition to substantive mail fraud and conspiracy against the United States.SAN FRANCISCO – A federal jury convicted David Jess Miller and his company, Minnesota Independent Cooperative (“MIC”), of a wide array of charges relating to the unlicensed and fraudulent distribution of prescription drugs, announced United States Attorney Stephanie M. Hinds; Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge Robert K. Tripp; Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), Special Agent in Charge of the Oakland Field Office Darren Lian; U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) Pittsburgh Division Inspector in Charge Lesley Allison; and U.S. Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI) Special Agent in Charge of the Metro Washington Field Office George A. Scavdis. The verdicts were handed down after a two-week trial before the Hon. Charles R. Breyer, Senior U.S. District Judge.“The health and safety of American patients are critical, and Americans are entitled to trust that the prescription drugs they take are safe,” said U.S. Attorney Hinds. “Those who undermine the safety of the prescription drug supply chain for their own gain by laundering diverted drugs put those patients at risk, and they will be prosecuted.”“FDA is responsible for oversight of the prescription drug supply chain; when criminals breach the security around that chain, patients can no longer be assured of the safety or effectiveness of the stolen drugs that are returned illegally to the legitimate supply pipeline,” said Special Agent in Charge Scavdis. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who would put the public health at risk through their criminal actions.”“When medical practitioners prescribe and patients receive medication, their focus should be on the effectiveness of the medication for the intended treatment and not the authenticity or legitimacy of the pills they get from pharmacies. The speedy guilty verdict shows the community’s intolerance of those who betray this basic trust in our healthcare system for greed and personal enrichment. IRS Criminal Investigation is committed to work with our law enforcement partners to dismantle and disrupt these criminal schemes and to instill trust and confidence in the system,” said Special Agent in Charge Lian. “I truly commend the case agents and the trial team who worked tirelessly on this case to bring justice to light.”\"The illegal conduct of David Miller was reprehensible,\" said FBI Special Agent In Charge Robert Tripp. \"He and his co-conspirators undermined safeguards designed to protect the public, reintroduced diverted prescription drugs into the supply chain, and compromised patient safety for personal gain.”The trial was the result of indictments filed in two separate districts—the Northern District of California and the Southern District of Ohio. The convictions included charges handed down in a second superseding indictment by a grand jury in the Northern District of California on February 11, 2016, and by a separate indictment handed down on May 6, 2015, in the Southern District of Ohio. Both indictments involved additional defendants and charges that were not presented at the trial.The evidence at trial established that Miller, 58, of Santa Ana, Calif., was at the center of a vast racketeering enterprise responsible for the fraudulent distribution of hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of diverted prescription drugs, including instances in which Miller and his co-conspirators distributed tampered medication that posed a health risk to consumers. The scheme targeted brand-name prescription drugs designed to treat HIV, hepatitis C, mental disorders, and various other serious conditions. Miller and MIC lied to their customers about the nature and sources of the prescription drugs being sold, falsely claiming that the drugs had been maintained in the safe, federally and state-regulated supply chain. The evidence at trial established that Miller and his company agreed with many others, including Mihran Stepanyan, 37, and Artur Stepanyan, 45, to conduct the affairs of their wide-ranging and long-lasting criminal enterprise. The evidence established that the enterprise, operating primarily out of Southern California and Minnesota, was responsible for distributing diverted prescription drugs to unsuspecting pharmacies throughout the county. In finding Miller guilty, the jury concluded that he played a role in promoting the racketeering conspiracy. For example, as the owner and operator of MIC between 2007 and 2015, Miller bought approximately $157 million of diverted prescription drugs from codefendants Mihran Stepanyan and Artur Stepanayan. Miller and MIC also knew that the Stepanyans were not licensed to sell prescription drugs and that the Stepanyans procured their drugs from street suppliers. Miller and MIC nevertheless purchased the diverted drugs from the Stepanyans and lied to their customers about the sources and nature of those drugs.Further, the jury concluded Miller engaged in a money laundering conspiracy. The evidence established that Miller and others laundered hundreds of millions of dollars between approximately 2007 and 2015 to promote their criminal activities and to conceal the nature of their scheme. For example, to hide the fact Miller was paying the Stepanyans for the illegally sourced drugs they were distributing, Miller made payments to the Stepanyans’ company GC National Wholesale through companies in Puerto Rico he controlled. As to another supplier, Miller authorized payments to accounts held in the names of various front companies at banks in multiple countries. In this way, Miller and his co-conspirators sought to obscure the illicit sources of MIC drugs and to conceal the true identities of the suppliers.In sum, at the conclusion of the trial, Miller was convicted of one count of racketeering conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d); one count of conspiracy to commit mail, wire, and bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349; one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h); ten counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341; and one count of conspiracy to engage in the unlicensed wholesale distribution of drugs and making false statement to the FDA, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 331(t), 333(b)(1)(D), 353(e)(2)(A), and 18 U.S.C. § 371.Miller remains out of custody pending sentencing. Miller faces a maximum statutory term of life in prison; however, any sentence will be imposed by the court only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. § 3553.The Stepanyans and 38 other defendants have pleaded guilty to their respective roles in the conspiracies.Assistant United States Attorneys Claudia Quiroz, Andrew Dawson, and Chris Kaltsas are prosecuting the case with the assistance of Kevin Costello. The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the FBI, the IRS, the FDA, and USPIS. The United States Attorney’s Office notes the extraordinary contributions and commitment of IRS-CI Special Agent Bryan Wong in this case.Updated January 27, 2023________________________________________ComponentUSAO - California, Northern"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeEastern District of North CarolinaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, January 27, 2023RALEIGH, N.C. – After a three-week federal jury trial, and 5 hours of jury deliberation, Anita Louise Jackson, 59, was found guilty on charges of adulterating medical devices for use on patients with intent to defraud and mislead, fabricating medical and healthcare records, paying illegal renumerations, mail fraud, and conspiracy.  Jackson was convicted of using re-used devices to perform more than 1400 surgeries for Medicare patients between 2011 and the end of 2017.  After the verdict, Jackson was taken into custody pending sentencing.“This doctor put profit ahead of patients, luring in Medicare patients with free “sinus spas” and risking infection to those patients by reusing the same single-use surgical devices on them again and again,” stated Michael Easley, U.S. Attorney.  “If we allow doctors to bilk Medicare to pad their profits by performing unsupported medical procedures— each and every American taxpayer eats the cost.  But the harm is most felt by the victim-patients who deserved better, and the elderly Americans on Medicare who are entitled to quality care.  Jackson’s blatant disregard for her patients’ health has led to her conviction on multiple federal charges.  My office is proud to work with the investigative agencies that helped bring this woman to justice.”Jackson was an Ear Nose and Throat doctor who operated Greater Carolina Ear, Nose, and Throat (GCENT), with offices in Raleigh, Lumberton and Rockingham.  Between 2011 and the end of 2017, Jackson preformed 1,555 balloon sinuplasty surgeries on 919 Medicare beneficiary patients.  Balloon sinuplasty is an in-office surgery to treat chronic sinusitis.  The FDA has cleared the Entellus XprESS device to be used in the performance of balloon sinuplasty procedures, but only on one patient, during one surgery.  After that, the device must to be discarded.    But, between 2012 and 2017, Jackson obtained, at most, 36 new Entellus devices, despite being, at times, the top-paid Medicare provider of balloon sinuplasty services in the United States.  The evidence showed that Jackson misled and did not inform her patients that they were receiving a procedure with an adulterated device.  The evidence also showed, and the defendant admitted on cross-examination, that she had sufficient money to buy every patient a new device -- but chose not to do so.Jackson billed Medicare more than $46 million dollars for the balloon sinuplasty procedures between 2014 and 2018.  She netted more than $4.79 Million from Medicare for these surgeries alone.  That amount does not include any sinuplasty surgeries performed on patients with private health care insurance, other than Medicare, and monies received from Medicare prior to that time.  The jury ordered forfeiture in the amount of $4,794,039.31 Million.“The FDA continues in its commitment to aggressively pursue those who deviate from required standards of use for medical devices,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin C. Fielder, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Miami Field Office. “We will remain vigilant in our efforts to protect consumers from potentially dangerous products.”Jackson was also convicted on 10 counts of illegally inducing her patients to receive the sinuplasty surgery, by failing to collect the portion of the surgery that the patient was required to pay – the co-pay.  Jackson, through her employees, marketed the sinuplasty surgery as a “sinus spa.”  In doing so, Jackson induced her patients to come to the office for a “free” sinus spa, induced her patients to receive a treatment they may not need, or may not have agreed to, had the full out-of-pocket cost to the patient been disclosed.  In an effort to continue obtaining patients for the procedure, Jackson wrote-off, or otherwise hid, the full cost of the procedure on any bills sent to the patient after their visit to GCENT.  The patient portion of the sinuplasty surgery could be as high as $1,500 for Medicare beneficiaries, which the jury found was not disclosed to patients.Jackson was also convicted of three counts of making false statements relating to health care benefits, two counts aggravated identity theft, and three counts of mail fraud.  Between 2017 and 2018, Jackson became the subject of three audits by Medicare contractors.  The evidence showed, and the jury found, that the defendant fabricated medical records supplied to auditors in an effort to keep more than $1.7 million that had already been paid to her by Medicare.  The jury convicted Jackson of fabricating and modifying medical records to justify the billing of balloon sinuplasty surgeries to Medicare auditors.  Two aggravated identity theft counts related to the defendant’s knowing use of forged patient signatures on documents in which patients allegedly declared that they received surgeries from the defendant, and that they needed them.  The defendant’s Mail Fraud convictions pertained to her fraudulent use of fake medical records to deceive auditors, and to deceive a fellow physician.  The defendant was also convicted for tricking a fellow ENT physician into signing a sworn statement that her medical documentation supported her prior balloon sinuplasty surgeries.The defendant was convicted of conspiring with her staff to commit device adulteration, to pay illegal remunerations, to make false records, and to commit mail fraud.\"It is disturbing when fraudsters exploit vulnerable Medicare enrollees and defraud federal health care programs for personal gain,” said Special Agent in Charge Tamala E. Miles of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General.  “Today’s verdict in this case shows that our agency, working with our law enforcement partners, will continue to hold bad actors accountable and protect both Medicare and those served by this program.”“Dr. Jackson corrupted her integrity and violated patient trust by putting profits ahead of quality care,” said Christopher Dillard, the Special Agent in Charge of the DoD Office of the Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) Mid-Atlantic Field Office. “DCIS will continue to work with its partners to root out fraud within the Department of Defense's TRICARE program.”The federal jury convicted Jackson on all 20 counts in the indictment, which included:  Count 1 – Device Adulteration 21 U.S.C. § 331(k),  21 U.S.C. § 333(a)(2) and 21 U.S.C. § 35l(a)(2)(A);  Counts 2-11 – Illegal Renumerations 42 U. S. C. § 1320a-7b(b)(2)(B) and 18 U. S. C. § 2; Counts 12-14 – Making False Statements Relating to Health Care Benefits 18 U.S.C. § 1035(a)(2); Counts 15-16 – Aggravated Identity Theft 18 U.S.C. § 102A(a)(1); Counts 17-19 – Mail Fraud 18 U.S.C. § 1341; and Count 20 – Conspiracy  18 U.S.C. § 371.Jackson faces a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years for Mail Fraud, 10 years for Paying Illegal Remunerations, and 5 years for Conspiracy and Making False Statements, and three years for Adulteration with the intent to defraud or mislead.  Aggravated Identity Theft carries a 2-year mandatory prison sentence, consecutive to any other punishment.  Jackson also faces fines exceeding $250,000.Michael Easley, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina made the announcement after United States Judge James C. Dever III published the verdict.  The United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG), the United States Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI), and the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service lead the investigation.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys William Gilmore and Karen K.

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, January 25, 2023Multiple dental practice owners and co-conspirators were charged in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for allegedly engaging in a multifaceted racketeering conspiracy through a multi-state network of dental practices and related dental businesses.On Jan. 18, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging 12 individuals with operating and participating in a series of dental practices and related companies (the Savani Group) that engaged in visa fraud, health care fraud, wire fraud involving federal tax evasion, and money laundering. Six of the defendants were charged with being part of a racketeer influenced corrupt organization (RICO) conspiracy based on their roles in the Savani Group, and three defendants were also charged with obstruction of justice.According to court documents, the defendants were allegedly part of a wide-ranging scheme to defraud Medicaid, U.S. Immigration authorities, the IRS, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to launder the fraud proceeds. Bhaskar Savani, 57, and Niranjan Savani, 51, both of Maple Glenn, Pennsylvania and both licensed dentists, owned and controlled the Savani Group dental practices. Arun Savani, 55, of Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, owned and managed the Savani Group companies and was responsible for the Savani Group’s financial affairs. The three brothers – Bhaskar, Niranjan, and Arun – allegedly conspired to recruit foreign workers for U.S. work visas while concealing the workers’ true job titles and responsibilities.Sunil Philip, 57, of Newton, Pennsylvania, was an outside accountant for the Savani Group and personal accountant of Bhaskar, Arun, and Niranjan Savani.

Along with Bhaskar and Niranjan Savani, Julian allegedly conspired to place adulterated and misbranded dental devices in U.S. commerce.Vivek Savani, 35, Bharatkumar Parasana, 55, and Hiteshkumar Goyani, 39, all of North Wales, Pennsylvania; and Piyusha Patel, 41, of Ankenny, Iowa, were employed under the H1B visa program under the pretense of serving in specialty occupations for the Savani Group but actually performed office support roles for the Savani Group’s dental practices.Susan Malpartida, 27, of Passaic, New Jersey, served in an office support function and allegedly obstructed the investigation when she made false statements about a Savani Group employee’s job function.The defendants and their charges:Name    Charges    If convicted, each defendant faces maximum imprisonment of:Bhaskar Savani    Conspiracy to commit racketeering, conspiracy to commit visa fraud, visa fraud, conspiracy to obstruct justice, conspiracy to commit health care fraud, health care fraud, money laundering conspiracy, money laundering, conspiracy to defraud the United States Treasury, wire fraud, and conspiracy to distribute an adulterated and misbranded medical device in interstate commerce.    Racketeering Conspiracy: (20 years)Conspiracy to Commit Visa Fraud: (5 years)Visa Fraud: (10 years)Conspiracy to Obstruct Justice: (5 years)Conspiracy to Commit Health Care Fraud: (10 years)Health Care Fraud: (120 years)Money Laundering Conspiracy: (20 years)Money Laundering: (210 years)Conspiracy to Defraud the United States Treasury: (5 years)Wire Fraud: (20 years)Conspiracy To Distribute an Adulterated and Misbranded Medical Device in Interstate Commerce: (5 years)Arun Savani    Conspiracy to commit racketeering, conspiracy to commit visa fraud, visa fraud, conspiracy to obstruct justice, conspiracy to commit health care fraud, health care fraud, money laundering conspiracy, money laundering, conspiracy to defraud the United States Treasury, and wire fraud.    Racketeering Conspiracy: (20 years)Conspiracy to Commit Visa Fraud: (5 years)Visa Fraud: (20 years)Conspiracy to Obstruct Justice: (5 years)Conspiracy to Commit Health Care Fraud: (10 years)Health Care Fraud: (120 years)Money Laundering Conspiracy: (20 years)Money Laundering: (210 years)Conspiracy to Defraud the United States Treasury: (5 years)Wire Fraud: (20 years)Niranjan Savani    Conspiracy to commit racketeering, conspiracy to commit visa fraud, visa fraud, conspiracy to commit health care fraud, health care fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States Treasury, wire fraud, and conspiracy to distribute an adulterated and misbranded medical device in interstate commerce.    Racketeering Conspiracy: (20 years)Conspiracy to Commit Visa Fraud: (5 years)Visa Fraud: (20 years)Conspiracy to Commit Health Care Fraud: (10 years)Health Care Fraud: (30 years)Conspiracy to Defraud the United States Treasury: (5 years)Wire Fraud: (20 years)Conspiracy To Distribute an Adulterated and Misbranded Medical Device in Interstate Commerce: (5 years)Sunil Philip    Conspiracy to commit racketeering, money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to defraud the United States Treasury, and wire fraud.    Racketeering Conspiracy: (20 years)Money Laundering Conspiracy: (20 years)Conspiracy to Defraud the United States Treasury: (5 years)Wire Fraud: (60 years)Amen Dhyllon    Conspiracy to commit racketeering, conspiracy to commit health care fraud, health care fraud, and money laundering conspiracy.    Racketeering Conspiracy: (20 years)Conspiracy to Commit Health Care Fraud: (10 years)Health Care Fraud: (80 years)Money Laundering Conspiracy: (20 years)Aleksandra Radomiak    Conspiracy to commit racketeering, conspiracy to commit health care fraud, and health care fraud.    Racketeering Conspiracy: (20 years)Conspiracy to Commit Health Care Fraud: (10 years)Health Care Fraud: (20 years)Jon Julian    Conspiracy to place adulterated and misbranded dental devices in commerce.    Conspiracy To Distribute an Adulterated and Misbranded Medical Device in Interstate Commerce: (5 years)Vivek Savani    Conspiracy to commit visa fraud.    Conspiracy to Commit Visa Fraud: (5 years)Bharatkumar Parasana    Conspiracy to commit visa fraud.    Conspiracy to Commit Visa Fraud: (5 years)Hiteshkumar Goyani    Conspiracy to commit visa fraud.    Conspiracy to Commit Visa Fraud: (5 years)Piyusha Patel    Conspiracy to commit visa fraud and visa fraud.    Conspiracy to Commit Visa Fraud: (5 years)Visa Fraud: (10 years)Susan Malpartida    Conspiracy to obstruct justice.    Conspiracy to Obstruct Justice: (5 years)Bhaskar, Arun, and Niranjan Savani, Sunil Phillip, and Aleksandra Radiomak made their initial court appearances on Jan. 20 in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A.

Chung announced today.Larry J. Goisse, Jr., 38, of the City’s Mt. Washington neighborhood, was sentenced to 24 months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release by Senior United States District Judge Nora Barry Fischer. On October 4, 2022, Goisse pled guilty to one count of an Indictment charging him with drug diversion, and five counts of an Information charging him with health care fraud.In connection with the guilty plea, the court was advised that in September 2018 through January 2019, Goisse, a former certified nurse practitioner, illegally prescribed the scheduled drug Aderall after his state medical license was revoked and he lost his DEA registration. In order to continue to receive payments from Medicare, Goisse submitted claims to Medicare for office visits under a co-worker’s license after suspension.Judge Fischer stated that Aderall, the drug diverted by Goisse, is a highly addictive drug and could cause harm if incorrectly prescribed.

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, January 13, 2023A federal judge sentenced a Florida woman to prison for making a false statement to a government investigator related to a clinical trial that studied the effectiveness of asthma drugs in children.Jessica Palacio, 37, of Miami, was convicted by a jury on Sept. 13, 2022, for lying to a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigator during a 2017 regulatory inspection of the firm conducting the drug trial. On January 12, U.S. District Judge Darrin P. Gayles sentenced Palacio to 36 months in prison and three years of supervised release.According to evidence presented at trial, Palacio worked from 2013 to 2015 as a clinical research coordinator at a clinical trial firm in Miami called Unlimited Medical Research (UMR). UMR was one of many companies hired to conduct a clinical trial designed to investigate the safety of an asthma medication in children. The drug manufacturer identified issues in the trial performed by the company based on a review of data and notified the FDA.In May 2021, a grand jury in Miami returned a two-count indictment against Palacio alleging a scheme to falsify medical records to make it appear as though pediatric subjects made scheduled visits to UMR, received physical exams from a clinical investigator, and took study drugs as required, when in fact these events had not occurred. The indictment alleged that when Palacio was confronted by an FDA regulatory investigator about her role in the clinical trial conducted by UMR, she submitted a false affidavit claiming that she had performed a screening visit of a child subject when she had not.Following trial, the jury found Palacio guilty of both conspiring to commit wire fraud and with making a false statement. The court subsequently granted a defense motion for a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy charge but denied a motion for judgment of acquittal as to the false statement charge.“Clinical trials play a critical role in establishing drug safety and efficacy,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head  of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Justice Department will work closely with its law enforcement partners to protect the integrity of this important process.”“Reliable and accurate data from clinical trials is the cornerstone of FDA’s evaluation of a new drug,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin C. Fielder in the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Miami Field Office. “Compromised clinical trial data could impact the agency’s decisions about the safety and effectiveness of the drug under review. Today’s sentencing demonstrates that those who attempt to subvert the regulatory functions of the FDA by making false statements to the agency to cover up falsified data will be held accountable for their actions.”Four co-conspirators previously pleaded guilty and were sentenced for their roles in the scheme at UMR. Yvelice Villaman Bencosme, M.D., 66, of Miami, was sentenced to 36 months’ imprisonment, and Lisett Raventos, 48, also of Miami, was sentenced to 30 months’ imprisonment. In addition, Maytee Lledo, 52, of Hialeah, Florida, was sentenced to 14 months’ imprisonment, which the court later modified to time served, and Olga Torres, 50, of Miami, was sentenced to 3 years’ probation.The FDA Office of Criminal Investigations investigated the case.The case was prosecuted by Senior Litigation Counsel David A. Frank and Trial Attorney Marilee L. Miller from the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch, with the assistance of Associate Chief Kyrsten Melander for Enforcement at FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel.Topic(s):Consumer ProtectionComponent(s):Civil DivisionPress Release Number:23-43"

Anderson faces federal charges for related crimes and is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty in a court of law.“My office takes government theft very seriously,” said U.S. Attorney Mark Totten, for the Western District of Michigan. “Thefts from VA medical centers deprive other veterans of needed medical care and resources. My office is dedicated to serving and protecting our nation’s veterans.”According to their plea agreements, Robertson spent over 20 years in procurement for the Battle Creek VA Pharmacy, where she was responsible for ordering supplies for veterans in need of medical care. In June 2017, Robertson stole 10 boxes of diabetic test strips from the pharmacy’s inventory and arranged online to meet McAllister and sell them for cash. After completing that transaction and several similar ones, McAllister realized that Robertson’s test strips were stolen, but decided to keep buying from her. She confided in Anderson that her “matra [sic] is not to ask too many questions.” Anderson replied: “Lol.” For over two years, Robertson and McAllister conducted hundreds of such transactions. Throughout the scheme, Robertson admitted stealing over 7,500 boxes of diabetic test strips, costing the Battle Creek VA Pharmacy over $400,000.“The theft of medical supplies intended for our nation’s veterans is a grave offense. Such schemes erode public trust, steal from the taxpayer, and divert valuable resources away from those who have rightfully earned them,” said Special Agent in Charge Gregory Billingsley of the VA Office of Inspector General’s Central Field Office. “My office is resolved to investigate and root out anyone who would attempt to benefit from these fraudulent activities.”“Medical products, such as diabetic test strips, that are not in the legitimate supply chain can present a health risk to those who buy and use these diverted products,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Ronne G. Malham, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Chicago Field Office. “FDA will continue to protect consumers by investigating and bringing to justice those who attempt to traffic in diverted medical products.”This investigation was led by the Food and Drug Administration and the VA Office of Inspector General, with assistance from the United States Postal Inspection Service. Finally, as noted above, the charges in the indictment against Steven Anderson are merely accusations, and he is presumed innocent until and unless he is proven guilty in a court of law.###Topic(s):Financial FraudComponent(s):USAO - Michigan, Western"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeCentral District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEMonday, January 9, 2023LOS ANGELES – A Tarzana man pleaded guilty today to federal criminal charges for running a nearly $6 million scheme in which he knowingly sold used skin-tightening medical devices that were deliberately misbranded as new, as well as counterfeit devices that he claimed were to be used with fat-reducing laser machines.Kambiz Youabian, 49, pleaded guilty to a two-count information charging him with mail fraud and introducing a misbranded medical device into interstate commerce.According to his plea agreement, Youabian owned and operated MSY Technologies Inc., a West Los Angeles-based company that did business under the names “Thermagen” and “Global Electronic Supplies” (GES).From March 2016 to June 2022, Youabian purchased used transducers, which are medical devices used to tighten the skin of dermatology patients by delivering ultrasound energy to a patient’s skin. Used properly, transducers are designed to provide no more than 2,400 treatments. After this number is reached, the devices are considered depleted and should be disposed of in accordance with health code regulations.Through GES, Youabian purchased depleted transducers for nominal sums, typically $50. Youabian then remanufactured the depleted transducers and added fabricated serial numbers to make the transducers appear to be new.Then, through his Thermagen company, Youabian fraudulently marketed and sold – for many times more than he paid for them – the remanufactured transducers to health care providers and customers as “new” transducers with 2,400 remaining treatments. To conceal his connection to Thermagen, Youabian used names of fabricated Thermagen employees on correspondences with victim providers and used out-of-state commercial mailboxes for Thermagen’s return of address on shipments, which he sent through the U.S mail.For example, in February 2020, Youabian, through Thermagen’s website, sold a device falsely advertised as “new” and “containing 2,400 lines” – and with a retail price of $1,695 – to a buyer. Youabian then shipped the device – which contained a fake serial number – from Los Angeles to Florida via the United States Postal Service.Youabian also shipped counterfeit PAC keys, medical devices used to operate laser machines designed to reduce fat on patients, through the mail.He then transferred his ill-gotten gains to bank account his controlled, including accounts he opened in the names of MSY Technologies, himself, and his au pair.In June 2022, law enforcement executed search warrants at Youabian’s home and the GES-Thermagen office in West Los Angeles.In the GES-Thermagen office, law enforcement seized 75 transducers in various states of refurbishment, a manufacturing workstation containing tools and transducer parts, and detailed records of GES and Thermagen’s expenses.Youabian admitted in his plea agreement to unlawfully selling thousands of medical devices, including transducers and PAC keys, and receiving at least $5,821,474 in fraudulent proceeds that should have been paid to the companies that are the sole U.S. distributors for these devices. Youabian also admitted to causing reputational harm to the device manufacturers and distributors of these medical devices.United States District Judge Dale S. Fischer scheduled a June 26 sentencing hearing, at which time Youabian will face a statutory maximum sentence of 23 years in federal prison.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations and the United States Postal Inspection Service investigated this matter.Assistant United States Attorney Gregory D.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeNorthern District of IowaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, January 6, 2023Replaced Pain Medication with Saline in the Hospitals’ Drug Dispensing MachinesA Cedar Rapids nurse who diverted narcotics to her own use at four major Eastern Iowa health care providers, including three hospitals, in less than two years, was sentenced today to five years in federal prison.  Sarah Jean Moses, age 43, received the prison term after pleading guilty in 2021 and 2022 in three separate federal criminal cases to five felonies, namely, one count of tampering with a consumer product, one count of false statements relating to health care matters, one count of violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), one count of obtaining a controlled substance by misrepresentation, fraud, forgery, deception, or subterfuge, and one count of theft of government funds.In a plea agreement, and at other hearings in the three cases, the evidence showed that, in 2006, the State of Iowa issued a registered nursing license to Moses.  Between 2017 and 2019, Moses acquired various controlled substances from her employers, including opioids such as hydromorphone (also known by the trade name “Dilaudid”), morphine, and oxycodone.  To do so, Moses secretly tampered with the vials of the controlled substances, replacing the pain medication with saline and restocking the tampered-with vials into a secure drug dispensing machine that the hospital’s doctors and nurses used.  To find out which of her employers’ patients were supposed to receive the pain medication, Moses engaged in an illegal practice known as “patient combing,” in which Moses used her access to her employers’ computers to examine private patient records.  Moses also made false and fictitious statements to her employers and in patient records to cover up her scheme.Specifically, in September 2017, during her first month working in the emergency room of a Cedar Rapids hospital, Moses accessed a secure drug dispensing machine that contained hydromorphone vials.  The hydromorphone was intended for emergency room patients who were suffering pain.  Moses also viewed 7 patient records without lawful authority at the Cedar Rapids hospital.  After the hospital discovered six tampered-with vials in the machine, the hospital terminated Moses’s employment and reported her conduct to the Iowa Board of Nursing (IBON).In March 2018, during her first month working for a major local home health care company, Moses was assigned to care for an elderly resident of a Marion assisted living facility.  A doctor had prescribed the resident oxycodone for leg pain.  Without the knowledge of her employer, and against the employer’s policies, Moses offered to pick up the resident’s oxycodone from a nearby major grocery store pharmacy chain.  Moses picked up the pain medication from the pharmacy but, instead of delivering the oxycodone to the patient, Moses diverted 56 oxycodone pills to herself and made a false entry in the patient’s medical record.  The home health care company immediately suspended Moses’s employment and reported her conduct to IBON.  Moses never returned to work at the home health care company.  As a result of Moses’s conduct, the pharmacy changed its policy regarding verifying the identity of persons who pick up prescription medications for others.Between September 2018 and November 2018, Moses worked at an Iowa City hospital.  Moses continued her scheme to tamper and divert controlled substances at the Iowa City hospital and, in doing so, illegally accessed 64 patient files.  Just as she had done at the Cedar Rapids hospital in September 2017, Moses removed the caps from vials of hydromorphone and then carefully punctured the vials with the needles and drew out the hydromorphone. Moses then refilled the vials with saline to make the vials appear as if they still contained hydromorphone. Moses also carefully replaced the caps of the vials to make it appear as if the vials were undisturbed, when, in truth, these consumer products no longer contained their declared values of hydromorphone. In this way, Moses made it appear as if the vials remained new, unopened, and filled with the controlled substance on their respective labels, that is, hydromorphone, when, in, truth, Moses had diverted some or all of the hydromorphone in the vials to herself. Moses then placed the tampered vials back in the dispensing machine.  Moses admitted that she acted with reckless disregard for the risk that another person would be placed in danger of bodily injury and under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to such risk.  In November 2018, the Iowa City hospital terminated Moses’s employment and reported her to IBON.Between January and March 2019, Moses worked as a nurse for another hospital in Iowa City.  Moses continued her scheme to tamper and divert at this hospital and, during the entire term of her employment there, stole hydromorphone, morphine, and oxycodone.  Moses illegally accessed 17 patient files at this hospital, which determined Moses was “patient combing.”  In March 2019, this third hospital terminated Moses’s employment.Moses later found a job working as a paraprofessional for a child.  Between April and August 2020, Moses stole over $6,000 in fraudulent unemployment benefits from the State of Iowa by underreporting her wages from the employment.  The federal government had appropriated the unemployment funds under the CARES Act of 2020 on account of the COVID-19 pandemic.Moses was detained before her sentencing after a U.S. Magistrate Judge found that she repeatedly violated the terms of her pretrial release conditions.  While on pretrial release, Moses used methamphetamine, failed to participate in drug testing and treatment, and possessed an assault rifle.  Between August and October 2021, while on pretrial release, Moses was caught shoplifting at the same Cedar Rapids big-box department store chain on six separate occasions.  Moses fled from the courthouse in a car after her probation officer informed her there was a warrant outstanding for her arrest for her pretrial release violations.  A deputy U.S. Marshal ultimately gave chase and apprehended Moses not far from the federal courthouse in Cedar Rapids.  Moses has prior convictions in state court for shoplifting and drunk driving.Moses was sentenced in Cedar Rapids by United States District Court Judge C.J. Williams.  Moses was sentenced to 60 months’ imprisonment.  She was ordered to make over $6,000 in restitution to the State of Iowa. She must also serve a three-year term of supervised release after the prison term.  There is no parole in the federal system.  At the sentencing hearing, Judge Williams observed that Moses’s case was one of the worst cases of narcotics theft by a health care professional he had seen and characterized Moses’s conduct on pretrial release as “abysmal.”United States Attorney Timothy T. Duax stated, “Sarah Moses’s conduct was egregious.  She placed the patients of three of Eastern Iowa’s major hospitals and a home health care provider at serious risk of harm when she replaced needed pain medications with saline.  Her sentence is well-deserved and hopefully will deter others who would be tempted to steal narcotics from their employers and patients.”“Patients rely on the knowledge that they will receive FDA-approved medications to manage their conditions,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L. Grinstead, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Kansas City Field Office. “When health care professionals tamper with those needed medications, we will pursue and bring them to justice.”On May 17, 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud.  The Task Force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.  For more information on the Department's response to the pandemic, please visit https://www.justice.gov/coronavirus.Anyone with information about allegations of attempted fraud involving COVID-19 can report it by calling the Department of Justice's National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF) Hotline at 866-720-5721 or via the NCDF Web Complaint Form at: https://www.justice.gov/disaster-fraud/ncdf-disaster-complaint-form.Moses is being held in the United States Marshal’s custody until she can be transported to a federal prison.  The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Timothy L. Vavricek and Jason Norwood, Assistant United States Attorney Clifford Cronk of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Iowa, and investigated by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, the Iowa Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, and the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector GeneralCourt file information at https://ecf.iand.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/login.pl.The case file numbers are 21-CR-19, 21-CR-47, and 22-CR-56.Updated January 9, 2023________________________________________TopicsOPIOIDSPRESCRIPTION DRUGSComponentUSAO - Iowa, Northern"

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, January 4, 2022Pennsylvania-based medical device distributor Jet Medical Inc. (Jet) agreed to pay $200,000 to resolve criminal allegations relating to a migraine headache treatment, and Jet and two related companies agreed to pay another $545,000 in a civil settlement involving the same device.In a criminal information filed today in the Southern District of Illinois, the government alleged that between April 2014 and April 2019, Jet introduced into interstate commerce devices that were misbranded under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) because Jet did not obtain approval or clearance from the FDA prior to distributing the devices. Jet’s device, the Allevio SPG Nerve Block Catheter (Allevio), was intended to treat migraine headaches by administering nerve blocks to the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG), a collection of nerves located deep in the midface of the skull. The information alleges that Jet never sought approval or clearance from FDA to distribute the Allevio for this intended use, nor did Jet conduct an investigational study regarding the Allevio’s safety and effectiveness when used as intended.The resolution announced today includes a deferred prosecution agreement and criminal penalties totaling $200,000. As part of the deferred prosecution agreement, which must be approved by the court, Jet admitted that it distributed misbranded devices in violation of the FDCA and agreed to implement enhanced compliance measures. The resolution also includes a civil settlement with the federal government under the False Claims Act (FCA) totaling $545,133. Along with Jet, related companies Medical Components Inc. (MedComp) and Martech Medical Products Inc. (Martech) are parties to the civil settlement.“The FDA approval and clearance process serves an important role in ensuring that devices used to treat patients are safe, effective, and medically appropriate,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “We will not permit companies to circumvent that process and put profits over patient safety.”“Medical device companies put vulnerable patients at risk when they fail to follow FDA’s standards and requirements,” said U.S. Attorney Rachelle Aud Crowe for the Southern District of Illinois. “This resolution reflects our commitment to holding companies accountable for violating the integrity of the FDA approval process and placing profits over people.”“Doctors and their patients rely on FDA oversight to ensure that the medical devices they depend upon are safe and effective for their intended uses. Device manufacturers who circumvent the proper regulatory path in bringing their products to market endanger patients and put the public health at risk,” said Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations Catherine A. Hermsen of the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice companies that ignore the law and jeopardize the public health.”“This medical device distributor undermined the integrity of the FDA approval process and disregarded patient safety for personal profit,” said Special Agent in Charge Curt L. Muller of the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “Working closely with our law enforcement partners, we will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who put the health and safety of patients at risk and waste valuable taxpayer dollars.”The civil settlement resolves a lawsuit filed under the qui tam or whistleblower provision of the False Claims Act in the Southern District of Illinois. That lawsuit alleged that Jet, MedComp, and Martech violated the FCA by causing medical providers to submit false claims to the Medicare Program for procedures using the Allevio. The lawsuit alleged the Allevio was not approved or authorized by the FDA for use in SPG nerve blocks for the treatment of headaches, and that the procedure was not covered by Medicare. The suit alleged that Jet, MedComp, and Martech instructed, coached, and encouraged medical providers to submit improper billing codes to Medicare for reimbursement of services using the Allevio device.The resolution of this matter illustrates the government’s emphasis on combating health care fraud. The FCA is one of the most powerful tools in this effort. Tips and complaints from all sources about potential fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement can be reported to the Department of Health and Human Services at 900-HHS-TIPS (800-447-8477).The FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations conducted the investigation.Assistant U.S. Attorney Luke Weissler for the Southern District of Illinois and Trial Attorney David Hixson of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch, with assistance from the FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel, represented the government in the criminal case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Laura Barke for the Southern District of Illinois represented the government in the civil case.Except as to conduct admitted in connection with the deferred prosecution agreement, the claims settled by the civil agreement are allegations only and there has been no determination of civil liability.For more information about the Consumer Protection Branch and its enforcement efforts, visit its website at http://www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch.

Romero announced that Jonathan Nyce, 73, of Collegeville, PA, was convicted by a federal jury of wire fraud and the interstate shipment of misbranded animal drugs. The charges arise from a years-long scheme to defraud pet owners of money by falsely claiming to sell canine cancer-curing drugs.In February 2020, the defendant was charged by Indictment for this scheme, which he operated by creating several companies, including “Canine Care,” “ACGT,” and “CAGT,” through which he purported to develop drugs intended to treat cancer in dogs. Using various websites for these companies beginning in 2012, the defendant marketed these “cancer-curing” medications to desperate pet owners, using the drug names “Tumexal” and “Naturasone.” The websites made numerous false and fraudulent claims regarding the safety and efficacy of these supposed drugs, including that “Tumexal is effective against a wide variety of cancers,” and, “[i]n fact, Tumexal will almost always restore a cancer-stricken dog’s appetite, spirit and energy!” As alleged, these drugs were nothing more than a collection of bulk ingredients from various sources, which the defendant blended together himself at a facility on Arcola Road in Collegeville.Further, through email and telephone conversations, Nyce induced the owners of terminally ill dogs to pay him hundreds or thousands of dollars for these drugs by touting the effectiveness of his products in treating a host of canine cancers. He also told prospective customers that their pets could become part of clinical trials, but in order to do so, they had to pay him large sums of money. Evidence presented at trial showed the defendant sold nearly $1,000,000 worth of drugs to approximately 900 different victims. The defendant’s marketing, sale, and shipment of these drugs violated the Food and Drug Administration’s Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act because the drugs were not approved by the FDA. The defendant even falsely claimed in promotional materials that his company’s research was “funded in part by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.”“When beloved pets become sick, caring owners look for treatments that can offer hope to keep their pet alive and comfortable,” said U.S. Attorney Romero. “Jonathan Nyce took advantage of that bond between pet and owner by defrauding customers and giving them false hope that they might be able to save their dying pet. That is both cruel and illegal, and we hope this verdict brings his victims a small measure of justice for their suffering.”“The FDA’s animal drug approval process ensures that our pets receive safe and effective products. Ignoring the FDA’s requirements and selling unapproved drugs to vulnerable U.S. consumers will not be tolerated,” said Special Agent in Charge George A. Scavdis, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office. “We will aggressively pursue and bring to justice those criminals who place profits above the health and safety of animal patients.\"The case was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigation with assistance from the Consumer Protection Branch of the Department of Justice, and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Christopher E.

Pourhassan and Kazempour allegedly deceived investors about the timeline and status of CytoDyn’s regulatory submissions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to artificially inflate and maintain the price of CytoDyn’s stock and attract new investors, and for their personal benefit, including by selling their personal shares of CytoDyn stock.Pourhassan was CytoDyn’s president and CEO at the time of the alleged fraud. Kazempour is the co-founder, president, and CEO of Amarex Clinical Research LLC (Amarex), a private company with offices in Germantown, Maryland, that managed CytoDyn’s clinical trials, and was CytoDyn’s regulatory agent in interactions with the FDA. Kazempour also served on CytoDyn’s Disclosure Committee, which was responsible for reviewing and approving CytoDyn’s periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.“The Department of Justice is committed to protecting the investing public from criminals who would exploit public health crises for personal profit,” said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “These charges also confirm the department’s commitment, together with our law enforcement partners, to hold corrupt C-Suite executives who abuse their positions and engage in securities fraud accountable for their actions.”“The indictment alleges that these defendants conspired to defraud investors in order to line their own pockets,” said U.S. Attorney Erek L. Barron for the District of Maryland. “Investors must be able to rely on the statements of biotech companies about their products. Executives who knowingly mislead investors must be held accountable.”The indictment alleges that Pourhassan and Kazempour made and caused CytoDyn to make materially false and misleading representations about the timelines by which CytoDyn and Amarex would complete and submit CytoDyn’s biologics license application (BLA) for leronlimab’s treatment of HIV to the FDA. In April 2020, after CytoDyn and Amarex repeatedly missed publicized timelines, Pourhassan allegedly directed Kazempour and Amarex to submit the BLA – even if it was incomplete – so that Pourhassan and CytoDyn could announce to investors that the BLA had been submitted. Pourhassan and Kazempour allegedly knew that the FDA would refuse to review an incomplete BLA.After Kazempour and Amarex allegedly submitted the incomplete BLA at Pourhassan’s direction, Pourhassan and CytoDyn misrepresented in a press release that a “complete” BLA had been submitted to the FDA when, in truth and in fact, it had not. Pourhassan then allegedly sold millions of dollars’ worth of CytoDyn stock based on material non-public information, including information about the fact that the BLA was, in truth and in fact, incomplete when submitted.“Financial crimes like securities fraud may not be violent, but they certainly are not victimless. The two individuals charged today capitalized on the hopes of investors and the public in supporting new treatments for ailments that affect people and their families,” said Special Agent in Charge Thomas J. Sobocinski of the FBI Baltimore Field Office. “This indictment sends a message to all sophisticated white-collar criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the FBI and our law enforcement partners and we do not tolerate the greedy intentions of those in such trusted positions.”“The conduct alleged in these charges erodes public trust in the safety and effectiveness of medical products, including drugs,” said Assistant Commissioner Catherine A. Hermsen of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI). “The FDA would like to extend our thanks to our federal law enforcement partners for sending a strong message to biotechnology executives and others that these types of actions will not be tolerated.”The indictment also alleges that Pourhassan made, and caused CytoDyn to make, materially false and misleading representations about CytoDyn’s investigation and development of leronlimab as a potential treatment for COVID-19, including the results and significance of clinical trials and the status of CytoDyn’s regulatory submissions to the FDA. Pourhassan allegedly knew that, in truth and in fact, leronlimab’s clinical studies failed to achieve the results necessary to obtain any form of FDA approval for use as a treatment for COVID-19 and the results CytoDyn publicly touted were neither statistically significant nor scientifically sound.“Throughout history, Postal Inspectors have investigated many investment schemes and the one thing that always rings true, where there are large sums of money to be made, scammers are always lurking,” said Inspector in Charge Eric Shen of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) Criminal Investigations Group. “In this case, these individuals took advantage of the dream of a possible new treatment for HIV and exploited investors, while dashing the hopes of many waiting for a cure. Postal Inspectors and their law enforcement partners will work tirelessly to bring to justice those who break regulatory and investment standards, keeping the investing landscape safe and free of crime for the American public.”Pourhassan and Kazempour are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud, three counts of securities fraud, and two counts of wire fraud related to the HIV BLA scheme. Pourhassan is separately charged with an additional count of securities fraud, an additional count of wire fraud related to the COVID-19 scheme, and three counts of insider trading. Kazempour is separately charged with one count of making false statements to federal law enforcement agents. Pourhassan will make his initial court appearance later today in the District of Oregon. Kazempour will make his initial court appearance later today in the District of Columbia. If convicted, Pourhassan and Kazempour each face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on each securities fraud and wire fraud count, and five years in prison on the conspiracy count. Kazempour also faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison on the false statements count. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.The FBI Baltimore Field Office, FDA-OCI, and USPIS are investigating the case.Trial Attorneys Christopher Fenton and Joshua DeBold and Assistant Chief Michael O’Neill of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Aaron S.J.

        "content": "Department of JusticeCentral District of CaliforniaFORIMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, December 15, 2022SAN DIEGO – Dr. David J. Smith, a pain management physician, and his office manager, Julia Ann Oertle, are charged in a federal grand-jury indictment with perpetuating a long-running scheme to commit healthcare fraud and to manufacture and distribute adulterated fentanyl.Smith made his initial appearance today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Bernard G. Skomal. Smith’s bond was set at $1 million, secured by real property, with a limitation on his ability to practice medicine. Oertle was still at large.According to allegations in the indictment, Smith purports to specialize in the installation and maintenance of intrathecal pain pumps which are surgically placed in a patient’s stomach with two catheters implanted on the spine; pain medicine is then infused into a reservoir in the pump periodically and meted out directly into the spine.Beginning in December 2017, Smith and Oertle began compounding fentanyl citrate into vials, in a room at Smith’s principal medical practice, San Diego Comprehensive Pain Management Center. According to the indictment, this compounding practice was grossly improper and resulted in the production of adulterated fentanyl. Smith nevertheless directed administration of this fentanyl to patients repeatedly.The indictment alleges that beyond providing patients with adulterated fentanyl, Smith violated the applicable standards of care by, among other things, prescribing materially excessive quantities of fentanyl, prescribing unnecessary oral opioid medications in conjunction with pain-pump medication, and installing pain pumps in patients without proper assessments for patient need. Smith then had false and fraudulent reimbursement claims submitted to Medicare for these administrations. Among other things, the claims were inflated by nearly 60 percent; they sought reimbursement for large volumes of unnecessarily manufactured fentanyl; they falsely represented that excess fentanyl had been discarded, when in fact it was used; and they did not disclose that the fentanyl was adulterated.According to the indictment, Oertle illegally ordered fentanyl citrate for compounding; compounded fentanyl with Smith; and helped direct the illegal billing practices.“We are supposed to be able to trust our doctors with our lives,” said U.S. Attorney Randy Grossman. “This office will use all its resources to protect vulnerable patients from doctors who use them to make money, with no regard for their safety.” Grossman thanked the prosecution team, the FBI, the DEA, the FDA, and the other members of the investigative team for their excellent work on the case.“Criminal misconduct within the healthcare system is not only deceitful, but also destructive,” said Special Agent in Charge Stacey Moy of the FBI’s San Diego Field Office. “David Smith and Julia Oertle allegedly abused their positions of trust by manufacturing and propagating this toxic poison to patients over an extended period of time, further unraveling the fentanyl crisis our country is experiencing. This investigation clearly demonstrates that the threat of the opioid crisis extends far beyond street level dealing. The FBI will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to protect our communities and ensure justice is served.”“The DEA is committed to bringing to justice doctors that take the public’s trust and abuse it for their own purposes,” said DEA Special Agent in Charge Shelly S. Howe.  “We are grateful for our relationships with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the FBI and the other agencies who worked to bring these defendants to justice.”“U.S. consumers must be able to trust that their medicines meet FDA’s required standards of safety and effectiveness,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Christopher M. Alston, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office. “Our office will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who jeopardize the public’s health and the public’s trust.”“According to allegations in the indictment, these defendants were trusted with the medical care of their patients but instead used treatments that were not medically necessary in order to gain financially,” stated Special Agent in Charge Tyler Hatcher of the IRS Criminal Investigation’s Los Angeles Field Office.  “We will continue to serve the public and help put a stop to schemes like this that take advantage of our medical system and put patients’ care at risk.”In California, patients receiving treatment at this practice who feel they want to change providers may contact their primary care provider for continued care.

        "content": "Department of JusticeDistrict of MassachusettsFORIMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, December 14, 2022Final defendant sentenced in NECC caseBOSTON – The former Director of Operations of the now-defunct New England Compounding Center (NECC) was sentenced yesterday in federal court in Boston for conspiring to defraud the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In 2012, 753 patients in 20 states were diagnosed with a fungal infection after receiving injections manufactured by NECC that were contaminated with preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (MPA), and more than 100 patients died as a result. The outbreak was the largest public health crisis ever caused by a contaminated pharmaceutical drug.Sharon Carter, 58, of Hopkinton, was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Richard G. Stearns to five months in prison and one year of supervised release. Carter was also ordered to pay a fine of $4,000. In December 2018, Carter was convicted following an eight-week jury trial of conspiracy to defraud the United States.“One may think that making misrepresentations or lying to federal regulators is a victimless crime. This case proves otherwise. In her role as Director of Operations, Ms. Carter conspired to deceive regulators into treating NECC as a lawfully operating pharmacy,” said United States Attorney Rachael S. Rollins. “The victims in this case – all trusting, innocent people – were simply seeking pain relief. Instead, those who survived were sentenced to a lifetime of anguish and trauma. This sentence speaks to my office’s ongoing commitment to the safety and protection of our residents in all areas of life and ensuring those who seek to do harm are held accountable.”“As NECC’s director of operations, Sharon Carter conspired with her colleagues to lie to federal regulators to perpetrate a massive fraud scheme that harmed hundreds of people across the country whose lives will never be the same. Our thoughts are with them as Ms. Carter is finally held responsible for her role in one of the worst public health crises in U.S. history,” said Joseph R. Bonavolonta, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Division. “While she now heads to prison, rest assured the FBI, and our law enforcement partners will continue to work to bring others who like her, violate the law and put patients at risk to justice.”“FDA depends upon truthful representations from regulated firms, especially in the area of high-risk drug compounding, in order to help protect consumers from potentially unsafe products,” said Fernando McMillan, Special Agent in Charge of the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, New York Field Office. “We are grateful that those at NECC who violated this essential principle, including Ms. Carter, have been brought to justice.”“Our nation’s veterans deserve the highest quality healthcare services, and this sentence demonstrates the VA OIG’s commitment to diligently investigating any potential criminal activity that could threaten the safety of VA’s patients,” said Special Agent in Charge Christopher Algieri with the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General’s Northeast Field Office. “The VA OIG appreciates the support of the United States Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their efforts to achieve justice in this case.”“This case demonstrates the commitment of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service to the safety and health of the American public,” said Ketty Larco-Ward, Inspector in Charge of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Boston Division. “The U.S. Postal Inspection Service, along with our federal law enforcement partners, will continue to investigate and take action against those who take part in this type of atrocious behavior.”The criminal investigation revealed that NECC pharmacists knowingly made and sold numerous drugs in an unsafe manner and in insanitary conditions. The investigation also revealed that NECC repeatedly misrepresented to the FDA and the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Pharmacy that NECC was operating as a pharmacy dispensing drugs only pursuant to patient-specific prescriptions, when, in reality, NECC was shipping drugs in bulk across the nation for over a decade, evading regulatory oversight through fraud and misrepresentation.As Director of Operations, Carter oversaw the processing and confirmation of drug orders received by NECC. Carter conspired with others to shield NECC’s operations from regulatory oversight by the FDA by claiming to be a pharmacy dispensing drugs pursuant to valid, patient-specific prescriptions. In fact, NECC routinely dispensed drugs in bulk without valid prescriptions. Carter directed employees to engage in numerous fraudulent prescription schemes to deceive regulators by creating the appearance that NECC had prescriptions for the drugs it was selling.Barry Cadden, former co-owner of NECC and head pharmacist, and Glenn Chin, NECC’s supervisory pharmacist, were both resentenced following the government’s successful appeals of their original sentences. On July 7, 2021, Cadden was resentenced to 174 months in prison and ordered to pay forfeiture of $1.4 million and restitution of $82 million. On July 21, 2021, Chin, NECC’s supervisory pharmacist, was resentenced to 126 months in prison and three years of supervised release. Chin was also ordered to pay forfeiture of approximately $473,584 and restitution in the amount of $82 million.U.S. Attorney Rollins; FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf, M.D.; FBI SAC Bonavolonta; FDA SAC McMillan; VA OIG SAC Algieri; DCI SAC Hegarty; and USPIS INC Larco-Ward made the announcement. Assistant U.S. Attorney Amanda P.M.

Mulvey, 30, of Grand Island, NY, who was convicted of tampering with a consumer product, was sentenced to serve 37 months in prison by Chief U.S. District Judge Elizabeth A. Wolford.Assistant U.S. Attorney Misha A. Coulson, who handled the case, stated that between February and June 2018, Mulvey, who worked as a registered nurse at Roswell Park Comprehensive Center, tampered with and stole controlled medications, including Dilaudid, from various medication dispensing machines located throughout the hospital, which tracked and held controlled substances meant for Rowell Park patients. She did so to satisfy her addiction. Mulvey utilized the patient medical record database to search for patients specifically prescribed hydromorphone, because to access the dispensing machine, she had to first access patient profiles. At times, Mulvey would divert vials of controlled medications from the dispensing machine and not administer the medication to any patient.On June 27, 2018, a scheduled vacation day, Mulvey was observed accessing a dispensing machine, carrying a backpack and exiting a medication room in which she was not assigned. It was later determined that Mulvey had accessed the drawer for hydromorphone. She was subsequently placed on administrative leave and resigned in lieu of termination.From June to July 2018, there was a spate of waterborne infections at Roswell Park, during which six patients became ill. An investigation by the hospital concluded that tampering of compounded hydromorphone vials was the cause.The sentencing is the culmination of an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Fernando McMillan, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, under the direction of Acting Special Agent-in-Charge Michael Stansbury, the New York State Department of Education, Office of Professional Discipline, and the New York State Attorney General’s Office, under the direction of Attorney General Letitia James.# # # #Component(s):USAO - New York, Western"

Handberg announces the return of an indictment charging Marina Sievert (57, Dunedin) with mail fraud, introduction into interstate commerce of an unapproved new drug, and monetary transactions in criminally derived property. If convicted, Sievert faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison for each mail fraud count (2 counts), three years in federal prison for each count of introduction into interstate commerce of an unapproved new drug (2 counts), and 10 years in federal prison for each money laundering count (2 counts). The indictment also notifies Sievert that the United States is seeking an order of forfeiture in the amount of at least $1.5 million, the proceeds of the charged criminal conduct.According to the indictment, beginning in July 2019, and continuing through April 2022, Sievert owned and operated Beauty Forever Florida Inc. (“BFF”), a Florida corporation that she used to order, purchase, import, receive, and distribute unapproved and misbranded drugs and medical devices. For instance, Sievert distributed Innotox, Medytox, and Meditoxin, which contained botulinum toxin type A, a highly potent toxin that could cause the disease botulism. Sievert acquired these products from a Korean pharmaceutical company that did not have the required approvals of the Food and Drug Administration for distribution in the United States. Sievert made fraudulent representations on her BFF website to her customers, such as false and misleading claims that BFF’s products were “FDA approved,” had “cleared customs,” and had “guaranteed authenticity.” Sievert collected online orders from the BFF website and used the United States Postal Service and private and commercial interstate carriers to acquire the unapproved new drugs from foreign pharmaceutical retailers. She then distributed the unapproved new drugs across the United States via the mail. Sievert used the proceeds of her illegal scheme, in part, to make two monetary transactions, each in amounts greater than $10,000, for the purchase of a vehicle and for her own personal enrichment.An indictment is merely a formal charge that a defendant has committed one or more violations of federal criminal law, and every defendant is presumed innocent unless, and until, proven guilty.This case was investigated by the United States Food and Drug Administration — Office of Criminal Investigations and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).

Navarro et al., 20 Cr. 160 (MKV).  SERVIS pled guilty before U.S. District Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil.  SERVIS will be sentenced by Judge Vyskocil on May 18, 2023.U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Servis’ conduct represents corruption at the highest levels of the racehorse industry. As a licensed racehorse trainer, Servis was bound to protect the horses under his care and to comply with racing rules designed to ensure the safety and well-being of horses and protect the integrity of the sport. Servis abdicated his responsibilities to the animals, to regulators, and to the public.  This latest conviction demonstrates the commitment of this Office and of our partners at the FBI to the prosecution and investigation of corruption, fraud, deceit, and endangerment in the racehorse industry.”According to the allegations contained in the Superseding Indictment, the Superseding Information charging SERVIS, prior charging instruments and other filings in this case, and statements during court proceedings:The charges in the Navarro case arise from an investigation of widespread schemes by racehorse trainers, veterinarians, performance enhancing drug (“PED”) distributors, and others to manufacture, distribute, and receive adulterated and misbranded PEDs and to secretly administer those PEDs to racehorses competing at all levels of professional horseracing. By evading PED prohibitions and deceiving regulators and horse racing officials, participants in these schemes sought to improve race performance and obtain prize money from racetracks throughout the United States and other countries, including in New York, New Jersey, Florida, Kentucky, and Saudi Arabia, all to the detriment and risk of the health and well-being of the racehorses. Trainers, like SERVIS, who participated in the schemes stood to profit from the success of racehorses under their control by earning a share of their horses’ winnings and by improving their horses’ racing records, thereby yielding higher trainer fees and increasing the number of racehorses under their control.SERVIS ordered hundreds of bottles of the drug “SGF-1000,” which was compounded and manufactured in unregistered facilities and contained growth factors that the defendant believed to be undetectable through regular drug screens.  Virtually all the horses in SERVIS’ barn received that drug, including the thoroughbred racehorse “Maximum Security,” who crossed the finish line first at the 2019 Kentucky Derby.  SGF-1000 was an intravenous drug promoted as, among other things, a vasodilator capable of promoting stamina, endurance, and lower heart rates in horses through the purported action of “growth factors.”  SERVIS approved veterinary bills to racehorse owners that contained concealed charges for SGF-1000, which were falsely billed under the line item “Acupuncture & Chiropractic.”  In September 2019, the New York State Gaming Commission released an advisory stating that SGF-1000 was prohibited under the racing rules and had been prohibited since 2012.  SERVIS continued to allow the administration of that drug on the horses he trained up until his arrest in March 2020.Horses trained by SERVIS were regularly administered the prescription drug “Clenbuterol” with no valid prescription, which was part of a deliberate effort to conceal that conduct from racing regulators and avoid mandatory reporting requirements.SERVIS further obtained and transported a misbranded version of “Clenbuterol,” which he obtained from convicted co-defendant JORGE NAVARRO.*                *                *Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation New York Office’s Eurasian Organized Crime Task Force and its support of the Bureau’s Integrity in Sports and Gaming Initiative.  Mr. Williams also thanked the Food and Drug Administration for their assistance.This case is being handled by the Office’s Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Sarah Mortazavi is in charge of the prosecution.Topic(s):Financial FraudComponent(s):USAO - New York, SouthernContact:Nicholas Biase (212) 637-2600Press Release Number:22-381"

        "content": "Department of JusticeNorthern District of CaliforniaFORIMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, December 7, 2022SAN JOSE – Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani was sentenced today to 155 months (12 years, 11 months) in federal prison for fraud that risked patient health by misrepresenting the accuracy of Theranos blood analysis technology and that defrauded Theranos investors of millions of dollars, announced United States Attorney Stephanie M. Hinds, Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge Robert K. Tripp, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations Catherine A. Hermsen, and U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) San Francisco Division Acting Inspector in Charge Kevin Rho. United States District Judge Edward J. Davila presided over his jury trial and imposed today’s sentence.“Patient health is the highest priority of our healthcare system, and Silicon Valley has long been home to healthcare start-ups that enhance the care of patients through technological developments,” said U.S. Attorney Stephanie M. Hinds. “Ramesh Balwani, in a desire to become a Silicon Valley titan, valued business success and personal wealth far more than patient safety. He chose deceit over candor with patients in need of medical care, and he treated his investors no better. Today’s sentence should serve as a lesson to anyone considering fraud in their own push for success.” A link to a video statement by U.S. Attorney Hinds is available here: https://youtu.be/GmA6GqCng_8.“Balwani not only deliberately concealed defects in Theranos' blood-testing technology to mislead investors, he knowingly put patients’ health at risk,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert Tripp. “Today's sentence reflects years of dedication by the FBI and our partners to investigate fraud within Theranos and bring the company's leadership to justice.”“Patients and their doctors rely on accurate, reliable test results to ensure a proper diagnosis of their condition. When individuals jeopardize patient health and put profits above the public health, the FDA will continue to investigate and bring them to justice,” said FDA Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations Catherine A. Hermsen.“Postal Inspectors and our law enforcement partners will continue to bring criminals to justice for schemes to defraud investors looking for innovation or concerned patients seeking health care,” said USPIS San Francisco Division Acting Inspector-In-Charge Kevin Rho. “Today’s sentence should be considered a serious message to anyone else who would engages in high tech medical quackery.”Balwani, 57, of Fremont, Calif., was employed from September 2009 through July 2016 at Theranos, Inc. Over time he held the positions of board member, chief operating officer and president. Theranos, now defunct, was a blood testing company based in Palo Alto and Newark, Calif., that was founded in 2003 by Balwani’s former romantic partner Elizabeth Holmes, 38, of Woodside, Calif. Trial evidence showed that Balwani and Holmes, who was chairperson and CEO, claimed Theranos developed a revolutionary blood analyzer, variously referred to as the Theranos Sample Processing Unit (TSPU), the Edison, and the minilab. They described the Theranos blood analyzer device as a single device that could run any blood test run by conventional labs using only a small blood sample drawn via a fingerstick, rather than the traditional draw from a vein. Balwani and Holmes asserted that the Theranos proprietary analyzer produced results that were cheaper, more reliable and less variable than existing methods, and obtained results at a speed faster than ever before possible.Among many other representations, Balwani reviewed and approved a 2013 Wall Street Journal article suggesting that Theranos had “devices that automate and miniaturize more than 1,000 laboratory tests” and stating that “Theranos’ processes are faster, cheaper, and more accurate than the conventional methods” and that “Theranos’ technology eliminates multiple lab trips because it can ‘run any combination of tests, including sets of follow-on tests,’ at once, very quickly, all from a single microsample.”The descriptions approved by Balwani were false and misleading. Trial evidence demonstrated that both Balwani and Holmes knew that the analyzer performed only a few basic tests and was slower than existing devices. They repeatedly resorted to using conventional machines to obtain the blood test results that the Theranos analyzer was supposed to perform. However, they led investors and the public to believe that Theranos was conducting essentially all of its tests using only its Theranos analyzer. Evidence demonstrated that Balwani and Holmes were aware that the Theranos analyzer’s limited capabilities meant it could not compete in the market, but they nevertheless trumpeted false claims and representations about the analyzer’s capabilities and conspired to convince patients and investors that the claims were true.Evidence at trial and examples in a sentencing memorandum filed by the government demonstrate the dark reality these misrepresentations created for patients. To portray Theranos as a legitimate enterprise, Theranos eventually offered the blood analyzer to the public to perform a “full range” of tests, despite internal protests from Theranos employees and even resignations by staff. Numerous misdiagnoses followed. A physician who testified at trial had sought Theranos testing and repeatedly received extremely elevated PSA results in comparison to earlier conventional tests. Elevated PSA is an indicator of prostate cancer. The Theranos results were later proved inaccurate when traditional, FDA-approved methods tests were run. In another example, a pregnant woman who had suffered multiple miscarriages obtained HCG values from Theranos testing that strongly indicated she was miscarrying again. However, confirmatory tests by conventional methods indicated a viable pregnancy, and the woman went on to deliver a healthy baby. This scenario played out with multiple pregnant women who received erroneous HCG results from Theranos tests. Even Theranos employees were not immune from inaccurate tests. One Theranos employee took blood-thinning medicine due to a history of blood clots and, when tested at Theranos, received a series of results that showed markedly different levels from previous conventional tests. As a result, a doctor adjusted employee’s medication. Confirmatory testing at a traditional lab showed the employee’s levels were normal; the medication adjustment had been unnecessary.These types of test results occurred many times. Theranos itself eventually concluded a patient impact existed for every test run on a patient and voided all tests with its analyzer.Amidst their repeated technology failures, trial evidence showed that Balwani and Holmes chose to continue deceiving their investor-victims and to proceed with the elaborate investor fraud conspiracy. They induced dozens of investors, many of whom were prominent public figures, to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in Theranos by using consistently glowing but false representations to investors and potential investors about the analyzer’s progress and its capabilities. Balwani and Holmes asserted to investors that the Theranos technology had been comprehensively validated by multiple major pharmaceutical companies and was being used by the Department of Defense to treat wounded soldiers where, it was represented, it “actually saved lives in the battlefield.” In truth, pharmaceutical companies did little work with Theranos and did not validate its technology, and the Department of Defense never used Theranos’ analyzer to clinically treat soldiers. False representations were also made that Theranos would dramatically increase its number of Wellness Centers within stores operated by its partner Walgreens from a few dozen to 900, despite Balwani and Holmes knowing at the time that the relationship with Walgreens was stagnating.Trial evidence demonstrated that Balwani and Holmes continued to tout Theranos’ analyzer as a revolution in healthcare while misrepresenting the dire financial status of Theranos. Despite Theranos having zero revenue in 2012 and 2013, they represented to investors in late 2013 and 2014 that Theranos had hundreds of millions in revenue from a combination of pharmaceutical companies and the military. Balwani conspired to induce Walgreens and Safeway to invest in Theranos based on false pharmaceutical company endorsements and fantastical revenue projections. By March 2015, Theranos raised more than $730 million dollars from “Series C-1” and “Series C-2” investors who invested subsequent to Theranos’ public relations push in 2013.Trial evidence showed the fraud brought spectacular personal wealth to Balwani. Balwani owned nearly 30 million shares of Theranos – over 6% of the company – which were worth hundreds of millions of dollars at the peak of the fraud. The government’s sentencing memo points out that, like Holmes, Balwani enjoyed the perks of serving as a Silicon Valley titan. Balwani’s yearned to “build the true American empire. A monopoly. Our obligation to USA.”Federal criminal charges were initially filed against Balwani and Holmes on June 14, 2018. On July 28, 2020, a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging both with two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349, and ten counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343. Of the two conspiracy counts, one alleged Balwani and Holmes conspired to defraud investors and the second alleged Balwani and Holmes conspired to defraud patients who used Theranos services. Some of the ten counts of wire fraud alleged Balwani and Holmes committed fraud on individual investors while others alleged Balwani and Holmes defrauded patients who were induced to purchase Theranos services.On July 7, 2022, after a four month trial, a federal jury convicted Balwani of all counts.Balwani was tried separately from Holmes, and in her trial Holmes was not convicted of all counts. On January 3, 2022, a different federal jury convicted Holmes of one count of conspiracy to commit fraud on investors and three counts of committing fraud on individual investors, which involved wire transfers totaling more than $140 million. The jury acquitted Holmes of the patient-related fraud conspiracy count and the three counts of fraud against individual patients. The jury could not reach a unanimous verdict with respect to three individual investor fraud counts against Holmes. An additional count of wire fraud relating to a Theranos patient had been dismissed during trial. On November 18, 2022, U.S. District Judge Davila sentenced Holmes to 135 months (11 years, 3 months) in federal prison. She was ordered to surrender to begin serving her sentence on April 27, 2023.In addition to the 155 month prison term, U.S. District Judge Davila sentenced Balwani to three years of supervision following release from prison. A hearing to determine the amount of restitution to be paid by Balwani is to be scheduled in the future. Balwani was ordered to surrender on March 15, 2023, to begin serving his prison sentence.Assistant U.S. Attorneys Robert S. Leach, Jeff Schenk, John C. Bostic, and Kelly Volkar prosecuted the case with the assistance of Madeline Wachs, Lakisha Holliman, Sara Slattery, Elise Etter, Susan Kreider, and Leeya Kekona. The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the FBI, USPIS, and the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations.Updated December 7, 2022________________________________________ComponentUSAO - California, Northern"

        "content": "Department of JusticeDistrict of MassachusettsFORIMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, December 1, 2022BOSTON – A former co-owner of the now-defunct New England Compounding Center (NECC) was sentenced today in federal court in Boston in connection with conspiring to defraud the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Gregory Conigliaro, 57, of Southborough, Mass. was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Richard G. Stearns to one year in prison and one year of supervised release. In December 2018, Conigliaro was convicted following a 41-day jury trial of one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States.Conigliaro was the Vice President and General Manager of NECC and served as NECC’s primary point of contact with federal and state regulators. Conigliaro conspired with the former co-owner of NECC and head pharmacist, Barry Cadden, and others at NECC to misrepresent to the FDA and the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Pharmacy that NECC was operating as a pharmacy dispensing drugs only pursuant to patient-specific prescriptions, when, in reality, NECC was shipping drugs in bulk across the nation for over a decade, evading regulatory oversight through fraud and misrepresentation.Though he was well aware that NECC was routinely shipping drugs to customers throughout the country without patient-specific prescriptions, from 2002 through 2012, Conigliaro (and his co-conspirators) always represented to the FDA and the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Pharmacy that NECC was only dispensing drugs pursuant to valid, patient-specific prescriptions—even going so far as to create fraudulent prescriptions and present them to regulators to conceal NECC’s true activities.Through this deceit, Conigliaro and NECC were able to avoid the FDA’s oversight authority—and the FDA’s requirement that drug-manufacturers follow cGMPs—and operate in a slipshod, unsafe manner, ultimately leading to a tragic outbreak of fungal meningitis that killed more than one hundred individuals and injured many hundreds more.“Mr. Conigliaro and his co-conspirators repeatedly made the choice to put their greed over patient safety,” said United States Attorney Rachael S. Rollins. “In turn, nearly 800 patients suffered terribly and over 100 died. Today's sentence sends a clear message to healthcare executives – if you lie to regulators, the outcomes can be deadly and we will hold you accountable.”The criminal case in this matter arose from the nationwide outbreak of fungal meningitis that was traced back to contaminated vials of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) manufactured by NECC. In 2012, nearly 800 patients in 20 states were diagnosed with a fungal infection after receiving injections of MPA manufactured by NECC, and more than 100 patients died as a result. The outbreak was the largest public health crisis ever caused by a contaminated pharmaceutical drug.In December 2014, following a two-year investigation, Conigliaro and 13 other owners, employees and associates of NECC were charged in a 131-count indictment. The indictment did not charge Conigliaro with having any role in the drug manufacturing operations of NECC.On July 7, 2021, Cadden was resentenced, following the government’s successful appeal of his original sentence, to 174 months in prison and ordered to pay forfeiture of $1.4 million and restitution of $82 million. On July 21, 2021, Glenn Chin was resentenced, following the government’s successful appeal of his original sentence, to 126 months in prison and three years of supervised release. Chin was also ordered to pay forfeiture of approximately $473,584 and restitution in the amount of $82 million.U.S. Attorney Rollins; FDA Commissioner Robert M.

        "content": "Department of JusticeEastern District of VirginiaFORIMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, November 18, 2022ALEXANDRIA, Va. – A doctor licensed in Virginia, Maryland, and elsewhere was sentenced today to 3 years for writing and referring compounded drug prescriptions in return for illegal kickback payments. The doctor previously entered into a civil settlement with the Government that requires him and the company he owned to pay $3.1 million.According to court documents, Dr. Thomas Raley, Jr., 53, of Baltimore, Maryland, was a physician specializing in orthopedic surgery, spine surgery, and comprehensive pain management services, who has practiced in Virginia, Maryland, and elsewhere since 1998. Raley was also the owner of a medical practice, which had offices in both Virginia and Maryland. In 2013, Raley and Seth Michael Myers, 53, of Crystal Lake, Illinois, began soliciting pharmacists to pay them kickbacks in return for Raley referring expensive compounded medications to the pharmacies.Raley’s first illegal kickback arrangement was with Michael Beatty, 53, of Finksburg, Maryland, who worked as a licensed pharmacist at Fallston Pharmacy in Fallston, Maryland. From in and around the spring or summer of 2013 to the summer of 2014, Raley and Myers conspired with Beatty to receive kickbacks for Raley’s referral of expensive compounded medications, which were billed to federal health care benefit programs, such as TRICARE, Medicare, and Medicaid. Ultimately, Raley was unhappy with his arrangement with Beatty because he did not find it lucrative enough.Raley chose to pursue other more lucrative illegal kickback arrangements. In and around late 2013, he met with Mohamed Abdalla, 48, of Allendale, New Jersey, who owned multiple pharmacies in northern Virginia, including Medex Health Pharmacy in Falls Church and Royal Care Pharmacy in Fairfax. Then, in and around May 2014, Raley, Myers, and Abdalla cemented their illegal kickback arrangement. As part of this arrangement, Raley agreed to refer expensive compounded medications to Abdalla’s pharmacies and in return Abdalla agreed to pay Raley 80% of the resulting profit. Over the course of 18 months, Abdalla paid Raley approximately $2.5 million in illegal kickback payments.Further, Raley used his illegal proceeds to fund his and his family’s lifestyle. For instance, he directed Myers to make his wife a salaried employee of the company that was setup to collect the illegal kickback payments. Raley’s wife was provided a salary of $200,000 and the company also used the illegal proceeds to pay for his wife’s lease of a Mercedes. Raley also directed Myers to have the company write him a $280,000 check, which purported to be a loan—but was never repaid— so that Raley could purchase a building in Baltimore. Finally, illegal kickback proceeds were also used to pay tuition at the private school attended by Raley’s children.In a parallel civil resolution, Raley and Advanced Spine and Pain, PLLC, owned by Raley at the time, jointly paid $3,159,378.51 to settle civil claims under the False Claims Act, the Virginia Fraud Against Taxpayers Act, and common law remedies.For their role in conspiring with Raley, Myers was sentenced to two years in prison and Beatty was sentenced to one year and one day in prison. For his role in conspiring with Raley and others, Abdalla was sentenced to four years in prison.Jessica D. Aber, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia; Wayne A.

Holmes was sentenced today to 135 months (11 years, 3 months) in federal prison for defrauding investors in Theranos, Inc. of hundreds of millions of dollars, announced United States Attorney Stephanie M. Hinds, Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge Robert K. Tripp, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations Catherine A. Hermsen, and U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) San Francisco Division Acting Inspector in Charge Kevin Rho. The sentence was handed down by United States District Judge Edward J. Davila.“Silicon Valley has seen the rise of companies whose inventions have changed the world and, through intellectual prowess, hard work, and sheer determination, this region continues to innovate,” said U.S. Attorney Stephanie M. Hinds. “Capital investment is critical to that innovation. When fraud is perpetrated on those providing the necessary capital, it staunches investment and can cripple an industry. For almost a decade, Elizabeth Holmes fabricated and spread elaborate falsehoods to draw in a legion of capital investors, both big and small, and her deceit caused the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars. Her sentence reflects the audacity of her massive fraud and the staggering damage she caused.”“Frauds such as the one perpetrated by Holmes can erode investor confidence which impacts our capital markets. Today's sentence should serve as a warning that deceiving investors will not be tolerated. The FBI is committed to investigating corporate fraud and working with our partners to help keep our capital markets working effectively,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert K. Tripp. “The FBI and our partners worked tirelessly on this multi-year case and are proud justice has been served as a result.”“Today’s announcement should serve as a reminder that fraud related to medical products will not be tolerated,” said FDA Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations Catherine A. Hermsen. “The FDA will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to bring to justice those who place profits above public health.”“Postal Inspectors worked closely with our partners at the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, and the FBI to bring this case to court,” said USPIS San Francisco Division Acting Inspector in Charge Kevin Rho. “USPIS remains committed to protecting consumers and investors from fraud.”Holmes, 38, of Woodside, Calif., founded Theranos in 2003 and held the positions of Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer. Theranos, now defunct, was a blood testing company based in Palo Alto and Newark, Calif. Evidence at her jury trial showed that for more than a decade, Holmes claimed that Theranos had developed a revolutionary blood analyzer, variously referred to as the Theranos Sample Processing Unit (TSPU), Edison, and minilab. She asserted that the Theranos proprietary blood analyzer device could run any blood test that was run by conventional labs, all from a blood sample drawn via a fingerstick rather than the traditional draw from a vein. She asserted the Theranos analyzer produced results that were better, cheaper, and more accurate than existing methods and at a speed faster than ever before possible.Trial evidence demonstrated that Holmes knew the analyzer was not producing accurate and reliable results. Holmes understood that at best it could only perform a few basic tests and was slower than existing devices. She knew that it could not successfully compete with the established conventional machines. Evidence showed that Holmes repeatedly had to resort to using conventional machines to obtain the blood test results that the Theranos analyzer was supposed to perform, though she led investors and the public to believe that Theranos was conducting most or all of its tests using its own analyzer.Evidence showed that Holmes, despite being aware of the Theranos analyzer’s failure to perform, was able to induce dozens of investors, many of whom were prominent public figures, to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in Theranos. She used direct communications, marketing materials, statements to the media, financial statements, models, and other information to reach potential investors and induce investments. Holmes consistently provided glowing but false representations to investors and potential investors about the analyzer’s progress and capabilities. She falsely represented to investors that multiple major pharmaceutical companies had comprehensively evaluated Theranos and had validated its technology, and she provided investors with reports bearing logos from pharmaceutical companies, falsely suggesting the pharmaceutical companies endorsed Theranos. Holmes misrepresented to investors that Theranos had a profitable, revenue-generating business relationship with the U.S. Department of Defense and that the Theranos technology had been deployed to the battlefield to treat wounded soldiers. In truth, Holmes knew the technology was never deployed in the battlefield and that Theranos had acquired little revenue from military contracts for trial-runs of the analyzer. Holmes also falsely represented to investors that Theranos would dramatically increase its number of Wellness Centers within stores operated by its partner Walgreens from a few dozen to 900, despite knowing that the relationship with Walgreens was stagnating.Trial evidence demonstrated that Holmes also misrepresented the dire financial status of Theranos to investors and its prospects for future earnings. In examples at trial, Holmes represented to one investor in 2010 that the projected revenue for Theranos in 2011 was $223 million, when she knew that Theranos’ revenue was dropping precipitously, from $2.8 million in 2009 to less than $600,000 in 2011. Holmes misrepresented to other investors that Theranos, which had zero revenue in 2012 and 2013, was projected to generate over $100 million in revenue in 2014 and to reach nearly $1 billion in 2015. She knew when she made these representations that Theranos would at best generate only modest revenue in 2014 and 2015.In its memorandum filed for the sentencing hearing, the government pointed to evidence that Holmes’ fraud was immensely successful. Projecting altruistic motives, Holmes raised hundreds of millions of dollars by duping investors of all experience levels to invest in Theranos. She fooled investors new to the healthcare and bio-tech sector as well those with deep sophistication and experience in that arena. By the end of 2014, her stock in Theranos was valued at more than $4 billion. She enjoyed a lavish life while carrying out her fraudulent scheme, living in a $15 million mansion and traveling in a Theranos-paid private jet. She gained a national profile, adorning the cover of Fortune, Forbes, Inc., Glamour, and T: The New York Times Style Magazine. Holmes dined at the White House, joined the Board of Fellows of Harvard Medical School, and was named by Time as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World. But as the government describes, her scheme not only deprived investors of vast sums of money, it also placed numerous others at risk of great physical harm. Wanting to paint Theranos as a legitimate enterprise, Holmes offered Theranos blood tests to the public, and Theranos’ flawed technology was used on patients with serious medical conditions. As a result, Theranos sent out inaccurate results to patients being screened for cancer, to women monitoring their pregnancies, and to one victim who was led to believe she had the precursor virus to AIDS, among many other examples. Theranos itself eventually concluded a patient impact existed for every test run on patients and voided all tests with its analyzer. The government points out that Holmes was undeterred and again choose deceit over candor by downplaying the extent of the patient impact to investor-victims and continuing forward with her elaborate fraud.Federal criminal charges were initially filed against Holmes on June 14, 2018. On July 28, 2020, a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging her with two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349, and ten counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343. Of the two conspiracy counts, one alleged Holmes conspired to defraud investors and the second alleged Holmes conspired to defraud patients who used Theranos services. Some of the ten counts of wire fraud alleged Holmes committed fraud on individual investors while others alleged Holmes defrauded patients who were induced to purchase Theranos services.On January 3, 2022, after a nearly four-month trial, a federal jury convicted Holmes of one count of conspiracy to commit fraud on investors and three counts of committing fraud on individual investors which involved wire transfers totaling more than $140 million. The jury acquitted Holmes of the patient-related fraud conspiracy count and on three counts of fraud against individual patients. The jury could not reach a unanimous verdict with respect to three individual investor fraud counts. An additional count of wire fraud relating to a Theranos patient had been dismissed during trial.In addition to the 135 month prison term, U.S. District Judge Davila sentenced Holmes to three years of supervision following release from prison. The parties were instructed to meet and agree on a future date for a hearing to determine the restitution amount to be paid by Holmes. No fine was assessed. Holmes was ordered to surrender on April 27, 2023, to begin serving her prison sentence.Assistant U.S. Attorneys Robert S. Leach, Jeff Schenk, John C. Bostic, and Kelly Volkar are prosecuting the case with the assistance of Madeline Wachs, Lakisha Holliman, Sara Slattery, Elise Etter, Susan Kreider, and Leeya Kekona. The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the FBI, USPIS, and the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations.________________________________________ComponentUSAO - California, Northern"

Kevin Castel imposed the sentences in Manhattan federal court.U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Illegally doping racehorses is animal abuse in the service of greed.  Such corruption threatens the health of racehorses and undermines the integrity of the sport.  Today, three defendants have been sentenced for their roles in perpetuating, and profiting from, the mistreatment of animals.  The sentences each defendant received appropriately reflects the seriousness of these offenses in the eyes of the law.”According to the statements in the Superseding Indictment, charging instruments, other filings in this case, and statements during court proceedings:The charges in the Grasso case arise from an investigation of widespread schemes by racehorse trainers, veterinarians, distributors of performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), and others to manufacture, distribute, and receive adulterated and misbranded PEDs and to secretly administer those PEDs to racehorses competing at all levels of professional horseracing.  By evading PED prohibitions and deceiving regulators and horse racing officials, participants in these schemes sought to improve race performance and obtain prize money from racetracks throughout the United States, all to the detriment and risk of the health and well-being of the racehorses.  GRASSO, a veterinarian, not only accepted payment in exchange for prescriptions for powerful and medically unnecessary PEDs, but he also created, distributed, and administered custom-made PEDs that were all misbranded and adulterated substances designed solely to improve racehorse performance.  Through this fraudulent scheme, GRASSO helped corrupt trainers collect over $47 million in ill-gotten purse winnings.  As standardbred racehorse trainers, BANCA and ALLARD purchased and administered adulterated and misbranded drugs to racehorses under their control, and as a result of their crimes, their horses earned approximately $16 million and $25 million in purse winnings, respectively.  BANCA and ALLARD stood to profit from the success of racehorses under their control by earning a share of their horses’ winnings and by improving their horses’ racing records, thereby yielding higher trainer fees and increasing the number of racehorses under their control.*                *                *In addition to their prison terms, LOUIS GRASSO, 65, of Pine Bush, New York, was sentenced to two years’ supervised release.  RICHARD BANCA, 47, of Middletown, New York, and RENE ALLARD, 35, of Canada, were each sentenced to one year of supervised release. LOUIS GRASSO was further ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $47,656,576.Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation New York Office’s Eurasian Organized Crime Task Force and its support of the Bureau’s Integrity in Sports and Gaming Initiative.  Mr. Williams also thanked the Food and Drug Administration for their assistance.This case is being handled by the Office’s Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit.  Assistant United States Attorneys Sarah Mortazavi and Anden Chow are in charge of the prosecution.Component(s):USAO - New York, SouthernContact:Nicholas Biase (212) 637-2600Press Release Number:22-356"

Burdelik, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Chicago Field Office.Zaman Alshafey, 35, of Dearborn, Michigan, was the owner and operator of Med Pro Pharmacy in Livonia, Michigan. Alshafey is charged with distributing misbranded drugs as the promethazine cough syrup was not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer the drug. Dispensing of promethazine cough syrup without valid prescriptions caused the drugs to become misbranded.According to the Indictment, from January 2018 to March 2021, Alshafey ordered more than 300,000 pint-sized bottles of promethazine cough syrup from various wholesale distributors who operate outside the State of Michigan. Alshafey then sold the cough syrup to drug dealers without a valid prescription from a licensed practitioner, and he failed to disclose this to the wholesalers. Alshafey paid the wholesalers via wire transfers from funds derived from the unlawful dispensing of the cough syrup.“A pharmacist violates the public’s trust by unlawfully dispensing any drug. We will continue to work with our federal, state, and local partners, to identify and target those in the medical community who illegally dispense prescription drugs onto the street.” Ison said.“Selling misbranded prescription drugs puts all consumers’ health at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Lynda M.

He was assigned to care for a critically ill patient admitted to the Sick and Intensive Care Unit following emergency surgery for a head injury. The patient was comatose and intubated when Mr. Gort was assigned to care for him. The defendant initiated a fentanyl drip to treat the patient’s pain but stole the majority of the bag of fentanyl for his own use, concealing his crime by lowering the drip rate on the IV pump and failing to accurately document the flow rate in the patient’s medical record. He then used this fentanyl at the hospital during his shift. Later during the same shift, the defendant drained a second bag of fentanyl hung for the patient into a cup, then filled the bag with saline to facilitate and conceal the theft. The defendant intended to take the cup of fentanyl for his personal use, but hospital staff interrupted him and escorted him out of the building. According to other staff members, the defendant’s drug use affected his behavior and clinical judgments. There is no evidence that the patient was harmed by the defendant’s act of illegally obtaining the fentanyl. The defendant participated in a voluntary interview with law enforcement agents on March 11, 2021. During that interview, the defendant admitted that he diverted drugs from the hospital between late 2020 and the date the hospital confronted him. He stated he usually obtained fentanyl by falsely identifying the drug as “waste” that was to be discarded, but he kept the drugs for his personal use. He also admitted to using saline to waste fentanyl bags after diverting the fentanyl. The defendant stated he used the drugs at work.“The defendant knowingly and repeatedly risked patient health for his own selfish interests,” said U.S. Attorney Cole Finegan. “Medical professionals have to be held to the highest standard when caring for critically ill patients. Stealing controlled substances is illegal, and this criminal conduct will be dealt with by facing prosecution under federal law.““Patients rely on the knowledge that they will receive FDA-approved medications to manage their conditions,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L.

Chermala, Kerry’s Director of Quality Assurance until September 2018, oversaw the sanitation programs at various Kerry manufacturing plants, including a facility in Gridley, Illinois, that manufactured Kellogg’s Honey Smacks breakfast cereal for Kerry’s customer, the Kellogg Company. In pleading guilty, Chermala admitted that between June 2016 and June 2018, he directed subordinates to not report certain information to Kellogg’s about conditions at the Gridley facility. In addition, Chermala admitted that he directed subordinates at the Gridley facility to alter the plant’s program for monitoring for the presence of pathogens in the plant, limiting the facility’s ability to accurately detect insanitary conditions.“Food safety professionals cannot conceal potentially dangerous problems from customers or government regulators,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The department will continue to work with its law enforcement partners to hold accountable those who engage in such conduct.”“Today’s announcement reinforces that if an individual violates food safety rules or conceals relevant information, we will seek to hold them accountable,” said Special Agent in Charge Lynda M. Burdelik, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Chicago Field Office. “The health of American consumers and the safety of our food are too important to be thwarted by the criminal acts of any individual or company.”In June 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that an ongoing outbreak of salmonellosis cases in the United States could be traced to Kellogg’s Honey Smacks cereal produced at Kerry’s Gridley facility. In response, Kellogg’s voluntarily recalled all Honey Smacks manufactured at the plant since June 2017. The CDC eventually identified more than 130 cases of salmonellosis linked to the outbreak, with illness onset dates beginning in March 2018. The CDC did not identify any deaths related to the outbreak.Salmonellosis can cause symptoms such as diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps that last several days in healthy adults. Absent prompt treatment, salmonellosis can cause severe dehydration and even death in infants, young children, the elderly, transplant recipients, pregnant women, and individuals with weakened immune systems.Chermala pleaded guilty before Magistrate Judge Jonathan E. Hawley in Peoria, Illinois. The sentencing date is scheduled for Jan. 30, 2023. Further information about the case will be posted to the department’s Information for Victims in Large Cases website at https://www.justice.gov/largecases.The matter is being investigated by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations.

Cunha.Alexander A. Istomin, 56, admitted that he routinely submitted fraudulent claims for in-person patient services that he falsely claimed to have performed at his offices in Rhode Island, New York, and Florida. In some instances, the patients that Istomin claimed he met with in person were out of the country at the time of the alleged visits. On many other occasions that he claimed to have been seeing patients, Istomin himself was either in a different state or another country, often times in Russia. The investigation also determined that the supposed office that Istomin maintained in East Greenwich, and to which he had some payments mailed, was a non-existent medical practice at which no medical services were provided.Additionally, Istomin admitted to a federal judge that he waived copayments for some Medicare patients, despite being aware that waiving copayments is prohibited. By waiving copayments that patients otherwise would be responsible for, Istomin induced his patients not to report his fraudulent billing to Medicare.Istomin also admitted that he carried out schemes in which he would use patient names and information to get prescriptions to be filled at pharmacies.  He arranged for those prescriptions to be returned to him so that he could then distribute those drugs to individuals other than those in whose names the prescriptions were filled.According to a signed Plea Agreement filed with the court, in addition to pleading guilty to charges of health care fraud, mail fraud, aggravated identity theft, and causing the introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce, Istomin will forfeit $4,379,158.98, the sum of money equal to the amount he received from perpetrating health care fraud.Istomin is scheduled to be sentenced on January 26, 2023.

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEMonday, September 19, 2022A federal jury convicted a Florida woman on September 13 of making a false statement to a government investigator related to her role in a clinical trial that studied the effectiveness of asthma drugs in children.According to evidence presented at trial, Jessica Palacio, 36, of Miami, worked from 2013 to 2015 as a clinical research coordinator at a clinical trial firm in Miami called Unlimited Medical Research. Unlimited Medical Research was one of many companies hired to conduct a clinical trial designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of an asthma medication in children. The drug manufacturer identified issues in the trial performed by the company based on a review of data and notified the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).In May 2021, a grand jury in Miami returned a two-count indictment against Palacio alleging a scheme to falsify medical records to make it appear as though pediatric subjects made scheduled visits to Unlimited Medical Research, received physical exams from a clinical investigator, and took study drugs as required, when in fact these things had not occurred. The indictment alleged that when Palacio was confronted by an FDA regulatory investigator about her role in the clinical trial conducted by United Medical Research, she made a false statement by submitting a false affidavit claiming that she had performed a screening visit of a child subject when she had not.Following trial, the jury found Palacio guilty of both conspiring to commit wire fraud and with making a false statement. U.S. District Judge Darrin P. Gayles subsequently granted a defense motion for a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy charge but denied a motion for judgment of acquittal as to the false statement charge.“The safety of our nation’s prescription medications depends on the accuracy of the clinical studies reported to the FDA,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department will continue to work with its law enforcement partners to protect the integrity of this important process.”“This announcement demonstrates that those who attempt to subvert the regulatory functions of the FDA by making false statements to the agency will be held accountable for their actions,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin C. Fielder of the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Miami Field Office.  “We commend the efforts of the Department of Justice for vigorously pursuing the prosecution of this matter.”Palacio is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 21, 2022.The FDA Office of Criminal Investigations investigated the case.The case was prosecuted by Senior Litigation Counsel David A.

        "content": "Department of JusticeNorthern District of TexasFORIMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, September 15, 2022A Dallas anesthesiologist who allegedly injected nerve blocking agents and other drugs into patient IV bags at a local surgery center – resulting in at least one death and multiple cardiac emergencies – was arrested Wednesday on federal criminal charges, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division, and U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas Chad E. Meacham announced today.Raynaldo Rivera Ortiz Jr., 59, was charged via criminal complaint with tampering with a consumer product causing death and intentional drug adulteration. He was arrested in Plano on Wednesday and will make his initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Renee Toliver in Dallas on Friday at 10 a.m.According to the criminal complaint, on June 21, a 55-year-old female coworker of Dr. Ortiz, identified in court documents as M.K., experienced a medical emergency and died immediately after treating herself for dehydration using an IV bag of saline taken from the surgical center. An autopsy report revealed that she died from a lethal dose of bupivacaine, a nerve blocking agent that is rarely abused but is often used during the administration of anesthesia.Two months later, on Aug. 24, an 18-year-old male patient, identified in court documents as J.A., experienced a cardiac emergency during a routine sinus surgery. The teen was intubated and transferred to a local ICU. Chemical analysis of the fluid from a saline bag used during his surgery revealed the presence of bupivacaine, epinephrine (a stimulant), and lidocaine, drugs that could have caused the patient’s sudden symptoms.According to the complaint, surgical center personnel concluded that the incidents involving M.K. and J.A. suggested a pattern of intentional adulteration of IV bags used at the surgical center. They identified 10 additional unexpected cardiac emergencies that occurred during otherwise unremarkable surgeries between May and August 2022, which the complaint alleges is an exceptionally high rate of complications over such a short period of time.In each of those cases – which investigators believe occurred on or around May 26 and 27; June 27; July 7, 15 and 18; and Aug. 1, 4, 9 and 19 – medical personnel were able to stabilize the patient only through use of emergency measures. Most of the incidents occurred during longer surgeries that used more than one IV bag, including one or more bags retrieved mid-surgery from a stainless steel bag warmer.The complaint alleges that none of the cardiac incidents occurred during Dr. Ortiz’s surgeries, and that they began just two days after Dr. Oritz was notified of a disciplinary inquiry stemming from an incident during which he allegedly “deviated from the standard of care” during an anesthesia procedure when a patient experienced a medical emergency. The complaint alleges that all of the incidents occurred around the time Dr. Ortiz performed services at the facility, and no incidents occurred while Dr. Ortiz was on vacation.The complaint further alleges that Dr. Ortiz, who had a history of disciplinary actions against him, expressed concern to other physicians over the disciplinary action at the facility and complained the center was trying to “crucify” him. A nurse who worked on one of Dr. Ortiz’s surgeries allegedly told law enforcement that Dr. Ortiz refused to use an IV bag she retrieved from the warmer, physically waving the bag off.Surveillance video from the center’s operating room hallway allegedly showed Dr. Ortiz placing IV bags into the stainless-steel bag warmer shortly before other doctors’ patients experienced cardiac emergencies.The complaint alleges that in one instance captured in the surveillance video, agents observed Dr. Ortiz walk quickly from an operating room to the bag warmer, place a single IV bag inside, visually scan the empty hallway, and quickly walk away. Just over an hour later, according to the complaint, a 56-year-old woman suffered a cardiac emergency during a scheduled cosmetic surgery after a bag from the warmer was used during her procedure.The complaint alleges that in another instance, agents observed Dr. Ortiz exit his operating room carrying an IV bag concealed in what appeared to be a paper folder, swap the bag with another bag from the warmer, and walk away. Roughly half an hour later, a 54-year-old woman suffered a cardiac emergency during a scheduled cosmetic surgery after a bag from the warmer was used during her procedure.“The safety of the nation’s pharmaceutical supply is critically important,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton. “The Department will vigorously prosecute this case consistent with the evidence gathered by our law enforcement partners.”“Our complaint alleges this defendant surreptitiously injected heart-stopping drugs into patient IV bags, decimating the Hippocratic oath,” said U.S. Attorney Chad E. Meacham. “A single incident of seemingly intentional patient harm would be disconcerting; multiple incidents are truly disturbing. At this point, however, we believe that the problem is limited to one individual, who is currently behind bars. The Department of Justice and our indefatigable partners at the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations and the Dallas Police Department will work tirelessly to hold him accountable. In the meantime, it is safe to undergo anesthesia in Dallas.”“Patients expect that their doctors will use only safe and effective medical products during their surgeries. When illicit tampering occurs, serious harm and even death can result,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L. Grinstead, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations. “Working with our law enforcement partners, we will continue to monitor, investigate and bring to justice those who would risk patients’ health and safety.”A criminal complaint is merely an allegation, not evidence. Dr. Ortiz is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.The U.S. Food & Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations and the Dallas Police Department conducted the investigation with the assistance of scientists from the University of North Texas. Senior Litigation Counsel Patrick Runkle and Senior Trial Counsel Yolanda McCray Jones of the Justice Department’s Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorneys John de la Garza and Errin Martin of the Northern District of Texas are prosecuting the case."

(VPI), conspired with others to distribute tainted and potentially unsafe apple and grape juice concentrate to customers in the United States and abroad. The indictment alleges that between October 2012 and June 2019, Bliesner’s juice products were made under insanitary conditions and contained potentially harmful levels of contaminants, such as arsenic.The indictment further alleges that Bliesner (the former president and primary owner of VPI) and VPI lied to customers about the age and quality of their products. The indictment alleges that in some instances, the defendants sold juice products after storing them for years outside and exposed to the elements. According to the indictment, at least some of those products later were sold to customers who supplied the National School Lunch Program, which provides free or reduced-cost lunches to children. The indictment additionally alleges that Bliesner and VPI failed to register two facilities that they used to store fruit juice products and lied to inspectors with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about the existence and use of those facilities.In November 2020, the United States filed a civil complaint in federal court seeking to enjoin Bliesner and VPI from producing, storing or selling juice or juice products. In January 2021, Bliesner and VPI agreed to a consent injunction in which Bliesner and VPI promised that they were no longer processing, manufacturing, preparing, packing, holding or distributing any type of food, and would not do so in the future without first notifying and receiving approval from the FDA. VPI subsequently closed.The criminal indictment returned today charges Bliesner with 12 felony counts of fraud, conspiracy, false statements, and violating the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The defendant is scheduled for her initial court appearance Oct. 5 before U.S. Magistrate Judge Alex Ekstrom of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.

        "content": "Department of JusticeSouthern District of West VirginiaFORIMMEDIATE RELEASEMonday, September 12, 2022CHARLESTON, W.Va. – Five physicians pleaded guilty in connection with prescription practices at HOPE Clinic, a purported pain management clinic that operated in Beckley, Beaver and Charleston, West Virginia, and Wytheville, Virginia.Four of the physicians each pleaded guilty to a felony count of aiding and abetting obtaining a controlled substance by fraud: William Earley, D.O, 66, of North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; Brian Gullett, D.O., 45, of Clarksville, Pennsylvania; Roswell Tempest Lowry, M.D., 88, of Efland, North Carolina; and Vernon Stanley, M.D., 79, of Fayetteville, West Virginia.Mark Clarkson, D.O., 64, of Princeton, West Virginia, pleaded guilty to five misdemeanor counts of aiding and abetting the misbranding of a drug involved in interstate commerce.According to court documents and statements made in court, from November 2010 until June 11, 2015, practitioners associated with HOPE (Hitech Opioid Pharmachovigilance Expertise) Clinic prescribed thousands of oxycodone- and morphine-based pills to individual customers. In some cases, these prescriptions provided an average of four to seven pills per day. Several HOPE Clinic locations averaged 65 or more customers a day during a 10-hour workday with only one practitioner working.Gullett, Early and Stanley each signed multiple oxycodone prescriptions for a HOPE Clinic customer at the Charleston location for both 30 milligram and 15 milligram pills. The prescriptions were issued between March 13, 2013, and November 18, 2013, for a total of 390 pills. Gullett, Early and Stanley admitted that the customer’s medical chart did not support these prescriptions and that the prescriptions were not for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual course of professional medical practice.Lowry signed prescriptions for a HOPE Clinic customer in Charleston for 180 oxycodone pills at 20 milligram and 15 milligram doses on August 12, 2014. Lowry admitted that he intentionally did not read the customer’s chart to determine if those prescriptions were for a legitimate medical purpose. Lowry instead issued the same prescriptions as previous physicians had for the customer.Gullett, Earley, Lowry and Stanley each admitted that these customers had multiple failed or abnormal drug screenings, reported being addicted to pain medication, bought pills on the street, and sold pills from their HOPE Clinic prescriptions to others. Gullett, Earley, Lowry and Stanley further admitted that they did not discuss the possibility of addiction or the need for addiction treatment with these customers.Clarkson admitted to helping HOPE Clinic issue prescriptions after major retailers had stopped filling them and smaller pharmacies could not meet the supply and demand of Hope Clinic customers. Some local pharmacies were enlisted by Patients, Physicians and Pharmacists Fighting Diversion (PPPFD), which managed HOPE Clinic’s daily operations, to compound oxycodone and other Schedule II controlled substances for HOPE Clinic customers. Because of restrictions on compounding a commercially available drug, HOPE Clinic physicians were instructed to write prescriptions for compound oxycodone in milligram doses that were not commercially available.Clarkson wrote compound oxycodone prescriptions for five different HOPE Clinic customers at the Virginia location between October 2014 and December 2014. All five prescriptions were filled at Adkins Pharmacy in Gilbert, West Virginia, for a total of 635 pills at 32 milligram or 16 milligram doses. Clarkson admitted that none of the five customers had a legitimate medical need for prescriptions at 32 milligram or 16 milligram doses, as there was no therapeutic difference between those doses and commercially available doses.Adkins Pharmacy agreed to pay $88,085.73 in civil monetary penalties in 2020. The settlement agreement resolved allegations that Adkins Pharmacy violated the Controlled Substances Act by filling illegitimate compound opioid prescriptions issued by physicians affiliated with HOPE Clinic. Adkins Pharmacy also entered into a three-year compliance agreement with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) that imposes heightened reporting and oversight requirements and sanctions for non-compliance.Gullett, Earley, Lowry, Stanley and Clarkson are scheduled to be sentenced on December 22, 2022. Gullett, Earley, Lowry and Stanley each face a maximum penalty of four years in prison, one year of supervised release, and a $250,000 fine. Gullett, Earley, Lowry and Stanley have also agreed to surrender their Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) certificates of registration and to not oppose revocation of their registration to dispense controlled substances. Lowry and Stanley have further agreed not to apply for re-registration, while Gullett and Early have agreed not to apply for re-registration to dispense Schedule II controlled substances. Clarkson faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison, one year of supervised release, and a $500,000 fine.Gullett, Earley, Lowry, Stanley and Clarkson were initially indicted in 2018 along with the owners, managers and other physicians associated with HOPE Clinic and PPPFD. The remaining defendants are awaiting trial. An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.“These pleas show our office’s continuing effort to protect lives and prevent future overdoses through all means possible,” said United States Attorney Will Thompson. “A lot of effort has gone into this case.”Thompson commended the investigative work of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services-Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigations (IRS-CI), the Food and Drug Administration-Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the West Virginia State Police, the Metropolitan Drug Enforcement Network Team (MDENT), the Beckley Police Department, the Kentucky State Police, the Harrison County, Kentucky, Sheriff’s Department, and the Appalachia High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Task Force (AHIDTA).United States District Judge Frank W.

        "content": "Department of JusticeSouthern District of New YorkFORIMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, September 8, 2022Lisa Giannelli Sentenced to 42 Months in PrisonDamian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced that defendant LISA GIANNELLI, received a sentence of 42 months in prison today for her role in an approximately 20-year scheme to sell and distribute to racehorse trainers and others in the racehorse industry “untestable” performance enhancing drugs (“PEDs”) for use in professional horseracing. GIANNELLI was one of over 30 defendants charged in four separate cases in March 2020, each arising from this Office’s multi-year investigation of the abuse of racehorses through the use of performance enhancing drugs.U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “For years, Giannelli catered to corrupt racehorse trainers by selling illegal performance-enhancing drugs designed to deceive the very people who could put a stop to these crimes. Today’s sentence sends a message that those who engage in fraud and animal abuse will be held to account.”According to the allegations contained in the Superseding Indictment, prior charging instruments, other filings in this case, and as established by the evidence at trial:[1]GIANNELLI was charged in United States v. Navarro, 20 Cr. 160 (MKV), a case arising from an investigation of widespread schemes by racehorse trainers, veterinarians, PED distributors, and others to manufacture, distribute, and receive adulterated and misbranded PEDs and to secretly administer those PEDs to racehorses competing at all levels of professional horseracing. By evading PED prohibitions and deceiving drug regulators and horse racing officials, participants in these schemes sought to improve race performance and obtain prize money from racetracks throughout the United States and other countries, including in New York, New Jersey, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky, and the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”), all to the detriment and risk of the health and well-being of the racehorses. Trainers who participated in the schemes stood to profit from the success of racehorses under their control by earning a share of their horses’ winnings and by improving their horses’ racing records, thereby yielding higher trainer fees and increasing the number of racehorses under their control. Indicted veterinarians profited from the sale and administration of these medically unnecessary, misbranded, and adulterated substances. GIANNELLI, a seller of customized PEDs designed specifically to evade anti-doping controls, personally earned hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales commissions from her sale and distribution of PEDs to trainers around the United States.GIANNELLI marketed these drugs as “untestable” under typical anti-doping drug screens and extolled the virtues of these illegal drugs by describing their potency and untestability.  In the course of over fifteen years during which GIANNELLI operated under the auspices of the company, Equestology, GIANNELLI deliberately lied to state investigators to cover up her crimes and sold vials with no or incomplete labels, with no hint as to the provenance of those unsafe and prohibited drugs.The drugs GIANNELLI sold included intravenous and intramuscular injectables that she sold to laypeople for injection into the horses under their purported “care,” many of which were seized at premises throughout the country at the time of the original indictments in this case, including barns located in New York. Those included “blood building” drugs (for example, “BB3” and other Epogen-mimetic substances), vasodilators (for example, “VO2Max”), and bags filled with scores of “bleeder pills,” each designed to covertly increase performance in affected horses.*                *                *GIANNELLI, 55, of Felton, Delaware, was previously convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit misbranding and drug adulteration in connection with her work for Equestology. In addition to her prison sentence, GIANNELLI was ordered to pay forfeiture in the amount of $900,000, reflecting the value of the adulterated and misbranded drugs GIANNELLI and her co-conspirators sold as part of his fraudulent doping schemes.Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI New York Office’s Eurasian Organized Crime Task Force and its support of the Bureau’s Integrity in Sports and Gaming Initiative. Mr. Williams also thanked the Food and Drug Administration and Customs and Border Protection for their assistance and expertise. This case is being handled by the Office’s Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit.  Assistant United States Attorneys Sarah Mortazavi and Benjamin A. Gianforti are in charge of the prosecution.________________________________________[1] As to GIANELLI’s co-defendants, these facts, including the entirety of the texts of the Indictments and the descriptions of the Indictments set forth herein, constitute only allegations and every fact described should be treated as an allegation.Component(s):USAO - New York, SouthernContact:Nicholas Biase (212) 637-2600Press Release Number:22-283"

U.S. District Court Chief Judge F. Dennis Saylor IV scheduled sentencing for Dec. 7, 2022. Mangan was charged on June 24, 2022.From approximately March 2020 to early October 2020, Mangan – a licensed EMT paramedic in Massachusetts – worked part-time as an EMT for an ambulance service company in Massachusetts. On or about Sept. 30, 2020, while working in Needham, Mangan tampered with three fentanyl citrate vials by removing fentanyl citrate and replacing it with saline. The liquid remaining in the three vials contained only approximately 4.4%, 6.8%, and 24.2% of the declared concentration of fentanyl citrate.“The grave consequences of the opioid crisis extend far beyond street level dealing of heroin and fentanyl, which continues at an alarming pace. Almost every one of the 15 units in the Criminal and Civil Divisions of this Office are handling matters relating to the opioid epidemic,” said United States Attorney Rachael Rollins. “Aside from the obvious opioid related matters handled by our narcotics and organized crime units, we are also prosecuting human trafficking and health care fraud as well as civil rights government fraud and public corruption cases all directly pertaining to opioids. There is no higher priority in my office than doing everything in our power, using every option available on both the civil and criminal sides of this office, to keep people and communities safe from these deadly destructive substances.”“The FDA oversees the U.S. drug supply to ensure that it is safe and effective, and those who knowingly tamper with medicines put patients’ health at risk,” said Fernando P.

Typically found in water and soil, and transmissible through contaminated medications, B. cepacia can lead to respiratory and other infections for people with weak immune systems, chronic lung disease, and other conditions.The FDA notified Figueroa in August 2016 that a sample taken from Pharmatech’s water system had tested positive for B. cepacia. Figueroa assured the FDA that Pharmatech would re-engineer its purified water system to prevent future contaminations.In March 2017, the FDA again inspected Pharmatech’s operations and asked Figueroa to disclose all products that the company had manufactured since its supposed water system upgrade.  Figueroa lied to the FDA investigators by knowingly excluding Diocto Liquid from its products distribution list (even though Pharmatech shipped over 7,000 units of the drug earlier that month) and by telling the FDA that Pharmatech’s new water system had met “acceptance criteria,” which was not true.In July 2017, the CDC notified the FDA of multiple B. cepacia infections in pediatric patients at Stanford Children’s Health Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital in Palo Alto, California and Johns Hopkins Children’s Center in Baltimore, Maryland. The FDA investigated, collecting bottles of Diocto Liquid from these medical centers. Several of the bottles contained unacceptable amounts of bacteria, yeast, and mold.  Some bottles tested positive for B. cepacia.  The FDA’s investigation revealed that Pharmatech had distributed those same bottles in March 2017 – something that Figueroa knowingly failed to disclose to the FDA.In June, Raidel pled guilty to conspiring to defraud the FDA, falsifying records in an FDA investigation, obstructing proceedings before the FDA, and distributing adulterated drugs.Juan Antonio Gonzalez, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and Justin C.

Uballez, United States Attorney for the District of New Mexico, announced that Tanya Puccini was sentenced on Aug. 30 to three years of probation for introduction and delivery of misbranded drugs. Puccini, 47, of Albuquerque, pleaded guilty on Jan. 7.Puccini was the owner and operator of Allstar Nutrition, a health supplement store in Albuquerque. In December 2017, Puccini began selling Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs), a type of performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) that stimulate the growth of certain muscle and bone. These products are prohibited by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and the World Anti-Doping Agency and are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).These drugs were sold in bottles labeled “not for human consumption” and “for research purposes only.” Puccini nonetheless provided verbal, printed and occasionally written instructions to purchasers for personal use of the drugs for fitness gains, such as muscle growth. For example, Puccini provided a written note to a customer in which she represented that the drugs were not “technically” SARMs but included instructions for using the drugs to promote muscle growth.Altogether, from December 2017 through June 2021, Puccini made retail sales of at least $107,486 of unapproved PEDs.“Misbranded drugs that are disguised as dietary supplements and contain potentially harmful hidden ingredients place American consumers at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L. Grinstead, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Kansas City Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who endanger the U.S. public health by distributing fraudulent and potentially dangerous products.”Consistent with a stipulation in the plea agreement, Puccini forfeits her interest in any drug she received or transferred that is or was adulterated or misbranded.

Cochcroft, 37, of Lexington, South Carolina, pleaded guilty on May 25, to one count of introduction of a new drug into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud and mislead and one count of manufacturing and possessing with the intent to distribute and distributing anabolic steroids. As part of the plea agreement, Cochcroft agreed to pay a forfeiture money judgment of $200,000 related to proceeds from his sales of illicit products. U.S. District Judge James P. Jones of the Western District of Virginia imposed the sentence.In pleading guilty, Cochcroft admitted that he operated businesses that marketed products as “dietary supplements” to the body-building and fitness communities to increase muscle mass. He admitted that some of these products contained osterine, a type of synthetic steroid known as a Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (SARM). The FDA has warned against the use of SARMs, including stating in a 2017 warning letter to another firm that SARMs have been linked to life-threatening reactions like liver toxicity, and that they have the potential to increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.“Workout supplements containing anabolic steroids and unapproved steroid-like drugs can be dangerous,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The department will continue to work closely with the FDA to prosecute those who seek profit at the expense of public safety.”“Cochcroft and his company placed public health at risk by unlawfully distributing unapproved drugs that have been linked to life-threatening conditions,” U.S. Attorney Christopher R. Kavanaugh said today. “Marketing and distributing unapproved drugs is not only dangerous, but a federal crime.”According to court filings, Cochcroft took steps to mislead and defraud the government and consumers in the sale of these products, including using multiple addresses with fictitious business names, working with Chinese suppliers to mislabel drug products as foodstuff items, and knowingly failing to seek approval for the products. During its investigation, the government seized various products containing anabolic steroids from Cochcroft’s business.

Richard Webber on Thursday sentenced a doctor from Town and Country, Missouri to a year in prison for a health care fraud scheme and ordered he and his wife to repay $235,977.On over 1,000 occasions spanning nearly a decade, Dr. Abdul Naushad, 58, and Wajiha Naushad, 47, had their unwitting patients injected with cheaper, foreign Orthovisc that had not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, Assistant U.S. Attorney Derek Wiseman said in court. The Naushads betrayed the trust of elderly and impoverished patients to fund a lavish lifestyle that included a $2 million mansion, two vacation houses and four luxury cars, Wiseman said.FDA-approved Orthovisc, which is sold by authorized distributors in the United States, comes in a pre-filled syringe. It is injected into the knee to relieve osteoarthritis pain and is available only by prescription.The Naushads concealed their actions from patients, employees and publicly-funded health insurance programs by, among other things, stonewalling questions from their chief of purchasing. After a shipment of foreign, unapproved injections was seized by the FDA, the Naushads had the next shipment sent to their home.Wajiha Naushad lied to her compliance officer and friend by telling her the injections came from a distributor in the U.S., and fraudulently persuaded the compliance officer that the Orthovisc had a required National Drug Code number.A jury in April convicted the couple of one conspiracy count and one count of health care fraud. Wajiha Naushad was sentenced Thursday to three years of probation.“Injectable unapproved medical devices that are smuggled from unknown foreign sources and come from outside the secure supply chain can present a serious health risk to patients who receive them,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L. Grinstead with the Kansas City Field Office of the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations. “Not only are the device components completely unknown, the conditions under which they are manufactured and held are outside the regulatory scrutiny of the legitimate supply chain. We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who traffic in illegal unapproved medical products,” he said.Special Agent in Charge Curt L. Muller with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General said, “The Naushads went to significant lengths to conceal their repeated use of and billing for a medication that they did not actually provide to patients. In addition to the defendants misleading patients and staff about the substance used for these injections, the Naushads deceived federal health care programs into reimbursing for a more expensive medication than was used. For HHS-OIG and our law enforcement partners, ceasing fraudulent activity that targets these programs is a top priority.”The Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Missouri Medicaid Fraud Control Unit investigated the case.

Runsdorf, 57, of Boca Raton, Florida, pleaded guilty to conspiracy, trafficking in counterfeit drugs, and money laundering conspiracy today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Christine L. Stetson.According to the indictment, from April 2014 until August 2021, Runsdorf, the owner and president of Woodfield Pharmaceutical LLC based in Boca Raton, Florida, conspired with drug traffickers in Houston, Texas, to distribute misbranded and counterfeit cough syrup.  Runsdorf’s company pleaded guilty to the same charges today before Judge Stetson.According to information presented in court, Byron A. Marshall, 43, of Houston, utilized Woodfield Pharmaceutical’s manufacturing facility and employees in Houston to produce more than 500,000 pints of counterfeit cough syrup. Marshall’s drug trafficking organization sold the counterfeit drugs across Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Wisconsin, California, Florida, Arkansas, and Ohio. Prices generally ranged from $100 to more than $1,000 per one-pint bottle. Depending on the market and brand of cough syrup, prices went as high as $3,800 to $4,000 per pint.During the conspiracy, Marshall communicated directly with Runsdorf regarding production of the counterfeit cough syrup.  At Runsdorf’s request, Marshall paid Woodfield Pharmaceutical in cash only, and Woodfield employees mailed the cash directly to Runsdorf in Boca Raton.Six codefendants, including Marshall, have already pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing.Runsdorf faces up to 20 years in federal prison at sentencing.  The maximum statutory sentence prescribed by Congress is provided here for information purposes, as the sentencing will be determined by the court based on the advisory sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors.  A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the U.S. Probation Office.“In April 2014, Actavis Holdco US discontinued production of Actavis cough syrup due to its widespread abuse by recreational drug users,” said U.S. Attorney Brit Featherston.  “After that, the street value of Actavis increased to more than $3,000 per pint.  In his greed, Adam Runsdorf, owner and president of Woodfield Pharmaceutical, used his position and connections to enable drug traffickers in Houston to produce thousands of gallons of counterfeit Actavis, labeled to be nearly identical to the discontinued product.  The conspirators in this case sought to capitalize on the scarcity of Actavis and other prescription cough syrups by marketing counterfeit versions to street-level abusers.”\"Today Adam Runsdorf pled guilty for his role as the CEO of Woodfield Distributors to illegally distributing thousands of controlled substances into our communities, Runsdorf misused the privilege granted by the DEA to handle controlled substances by conspiring with street level drug dealers to manufacture fake drug labels to help drug dealers profit,\" said DEA Special Agent in Charge of the Houston Division Daniel C. Comeaux.\" This case is another example of the DEA's continued commitment to combat our nation's opioid crisis and ensure that registrants remain compliant regardless of their position. We will continue to aggressively pursue and hold accountable anyone attempting to profit from driving overdoses and violent crime in our communities.\"“This is an important victory for the American public. Not only is Adam Runsdorf going to jail for his crimes, but he and his business, Woodfield Pharmaceutical, will forfeit to the government over $8.4 million of illegal proceeds,” said Christopher J. Altemus, Jr., Special Agent in Charge, IRS Criminal Investigation, Dallas Field Office. “IRS Criminal Investigation special agents are committed to using their forensic accounting skills to help unravel complex fraud and money laundering schemes in order to financially disrupt and dismantle major drug trafficking organizations.

Varlan, United States District Judge.Torres faces a term of up to five years in Federal prison, $250,000 in fines, and three years of supervised release.As part of the written plea agreement, Torres waived indictment by a Federal Grand Jury and agreed to plead guilty to the aforementioned charge.  Torres conspired and agreed with others to unlawfully purchase short-supply drugs and resell those drugs to wholesale distributors.  Torres and another company entered business arrangements with retail pharmacies that were not licensed to engage in the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs.  Torres used the business arrangements with retail pharmacies to purchase prescription drugs from authorized distributors.  Torres then resold those drugs to wholesale distributors at a significant markup.  Torres knowingly misled the authorized distributors by using the pharmacies’ accounts and credentials to purchase drugs from authorized distributors.For example, on or about March 23, 2020, Torres purchased hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets from a pharmacy located in the Eastern District of Tennessee, an unlicensed wholesale distributor, for $178 per unit, which was subsequently resold to a Veterans Affairs Medical Center in New York for $442 per unit by one of Torres’s wholesale distribution customers.As part of the written plea agreement, Torres agreed to a personal money judgment in favor of the United States in the amount of $119,350, which represents the amount of proceeds Torres personally obtained from the offense described in the plea agreement.“This plea agreement represents the commitment of the U.S. Attorney’s Office to prosecuting those who exploited the fears of others to unlawfully profit during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said U.S. Attorney Francis M.

Sellinger announced today.Alain Bouaziz, 69, a French citizen and resident of the United Arab Emirates, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Evelyn Padin in Newark federal court to an information charging him with one count of making false statements to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:Bouaziz represented himself to be the chief operating officer of Hexim Pharmaceuticals (Hexim), a company headquartered in Secaucus, New Jersey. Hexim was previously known as Alkopharma USA Inc.Beginning in February 2018, Bouaziz submitted forged documents and made false statements to the FDA to try to fraudulently gain control of Sanorex, a weight-loss pharmaceutical owned by a major international pharmaceutical company. Bouaziz sent letters and documents by email and in hard copy to the FDA falsely stating that Hexim had purchased the New Drug Application for Sanorex and requesting a meeting about marketing Sanorex in the United States. These representations were false because neither Hexim nor Alkopharma owned the rights to distribute Sanorex.The count of making false statements is punishable by a maximum term of five years in prison and a maximum fine of up to $250,000, or twice the gross gain or loss caused by the offense, whichever is greatest.

        "content": "Department of JusticeEastern District of PennsylvaniaFORIMMEDIATE RELEASEMonday, August 8, 2022PHILADELPHIA – United States Attorney Jacqueline C. Romero announced that William Merlino, 85, of Mays Landing, NJ, was convicted at trial of selling misbranded drugs online, arising from his scheme to sell a toxic industrial chemical as a weight-loss drug which he manufactured in a lab in his home.In December 2019, the defendant was charged with one count of introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce in connection with operating a business through which he packaged and sold Dinitriophenol (DNP) for human consumption from at least November 2017 until March 2019. In the 1930s, before the law required drugs to be proven safe before they were marketed, DNP was used as a weight-loss drug despite significant negative side effects, including dehydration, cataracts, liver damage, and death. The chemical has never been approved for human consumption by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but has a variety of industrial/commercial uses, such as herbicides, dyes, and wood preservatives. Using Twitter to advertise, eBay to sell, and email to communicate with clients, Merlino earned approximately $54,000 from clients in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. through the sale of this drug. During trial, a witness from the shipping service the defendant used to ship the drug to customers testified that they referred to Merlino among their colleagues as ‘the yellow man,’ due to the fact that every time he would bring in a package to ship, he would have yellow dust from the chemical on his skin, nails and clothes.After a year-long investigation by the FDA, investigators served a search warrant at the defendant’s residence, where they found bulk DNP, packaging and encapsulating materials, and a pill press. Subsequently, while awaiting trial on this charge, Merlino faked a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in order to attempt to avoid trial; the jury heard evidence that the defendant altered a doctor’s letter and his medical records. As a result, the defendant is now separately facing obstruction of justice charges related to these fraudulent submissions to the court.“The United States sets standards for the foods and drugs we ingest in order to keep American consumers and patients safe,” said U.S. Attorney Romero. “The defendant knowingly skirted our country’s regulations by marketing an unsafe chemical to people hoping for a quick and easy solution. This scheme put many people’s health and safety at risk. We urge everyone to refrain from ingesting DNP for any reason.”“The distribution of misbranded, unapproved and dangerous drugs in the U.S. marketplace puts consumers’ health at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge George A. Scavdis, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who jeopardize the public health.”“The Postal Service has no interest in being the unwitting accomplice to anyone using the U.S. Mail to distribute contraband or other harmful substances,” said Damon Wood, Inspector in Charge of the Philadelphia Division of the United States Postal Inspection Service. “One of the Inspection Service’s key objectives is to rid the mail of illegal and dangerous substances that at best fleece our fellow citizens, and at worst, cause serious harm. William Merlino is no different than the snake oil salesmen from a century ago. Thanks to hard work of the Inspectors, Special Agents from the FDA and an Assistant United States Attorney’s Office, a jury saw through Merlino’s lies and held him accountable.”The case was investigated by U.S. Food & Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, U. S.

Lowery.Mohamed Mokbel, 57, and Fathy Elsafty, 63, both of Houston, are expected to make their initial appearances before U.S. Magistrate Judge Yvonne Ho today at 2 p.m.The 18-count superseding indictment, returned July 20, alleges that from 2013 to January 2022, Mokbel and ElSafty conspired to commit a $150 million mail fraud and health care fraud scheme and engaged in money laundering with the fraud proceeds. Mokbel is also alleged to have continued the fraud scheme at MK Pharmacy, a Houston area pharmacy, from April 2021 through January 2022. During this time, he had been permitted release on bond after the return of the original indictment in March 2021.Mokbel was the CEO of 4M Pharmaceuticals Inc., according to the charges. With ElSafty’s assistance, he allegedly acquired and controlled over a dozen pharmacies that operated in Houston and elsewhere. The indictment alleges Elsafty served as 4M’s accountant and tax preparer and had ownership interests in several pharmacies located in California, Texas and Florida. ElSafty allegedly aided Mokbel by falsifying corporate filings and concealing Mokbel’s involvement in the pharmacies.The fraud was pervasive and carried out using a sophisticated mass marketing scheme targeting individuals over the age of 55 using telemarketing and mail, according to the charges. Mokbel is alleged to have purchased patient data and directed 4M Pharmaceuticals’ employees to submit test claims to patient insurance plans to determine insurance coverage.4M then allegedly sent prescription fax requests to doctors’ offices on behalf of the patients without their knowledge or consent. In some cases, 4M requested prescriptions for patients who had been dead for months, if not years, according to the allegations.Company employees then allegedly called patients to report their doctor had approved prescriptions for them and that they would receive the medications at no cost. However, Medicare and other insurance plans often required a copay which 4M did not collect, according to the charges. When audited, 4M allegedly falsified proof of the copay collection.Mokbel and ElSafty are charged with one count of a conspiracy to commit mail and health care fraud, two counts of health care fraud and 15 counts of money laundering.If convicted of the conspiracy, they face up to 20 years in prison, while the health care violations carry a 10-year-term. Money laundering also carries a potential 10-year sentence. The use of telemarketing to target people over 55 as a means to commit mail fraud and health care fraud carries an additional penalty of 10 years. Fines could also be assessed in the amounts of $250,000 or not more than twice the amount of the criminally derived property involved in the transaction.Department of Health and Human Services - Office of Inspector General, Food and Drug Administration - Office of Criminal Investigations, Homeland Security Investigations, FBI, Texas Attorney General’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, IRS - Criminal Investigation, Ohio Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, Texas State Board of Pharmacy, U.S. Postal Inspection Service and California Department of Health Care Services, conducted the joint investigation.Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Abdul Farukhi and Assistant U.S. Attorney Zahra Fenelon are prosecuting the case.

        "content": "Department of JusticeEastern District of WashingtonFORIMMEDIATE RELEASEMonday, August 1, 2022Spokane, Washington – Vanessa R. Waldref, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington, announced today that Esther Rae Tuller, age 41, of Moses Lake, Washington, was sentenced today in federal court in Spokane for tampering with morphine medication while working as a registered nurse. Chief United States District Judge Stanley A. Bastian sentenced Tuller to 18 months in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release.According to court documents, between August 2019 and April 2020, Tuller was a Washington-licensed registered nurse employed at the Confluence Health Clinic in Moses Lake. Her position as a nurse provided her with access to medications, including opioid narcotics such as morphine, an opioid derivative commonly prescribed by hospitals and health care facilities to relieve pain.While working at Confluence Health, Tuller used syringes to remove morphine from at least 17 vials, and then ingested that morphine as part of her own opioid addiction. She then replaced the morphine with a saline solution that was essentially salt dissolved in water, and attempted to glue the caps back onto the vials to make them appear intact. Before Tuller was apprehended by law enforcement, at least one Confluence Health patient who was prescribed morphine had to be rushed to the emergency room; that patient continued to be in excruciating pain after receiving only saline from what was supposed to be morphine vials. In sentencing Ms. Tuller, Chief Judge Bastian noted that Tuller’s conduct did not simply involve stealing medications, but putting patients at risk.United States Attorney Vanessa R. Waldref emphasized that fostering safe and strong communities in Eastern Washington means addressing the opioid epidemic in all of its forms. “While Ms. Tuller’s addiction to opioids is both tragic and far too common, her decision to take advantage of her access to medical-grade morphine was an egregious breach of trust. It is deeply troubling that she compounded her misconduct by secretly replacing that morphine with saline in vials that she knew would be distributed to patients, recklessly endangering patients who rely on the integrity of our health care system every day.” United States Attorney Waldref continued: “I want to especially commend the stellar investigative work by the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Diversion Group and the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to hold accountable those who abuse their position of trust and endanger patients.”“Our DEA Diversion Investigators are another tool we are utilizing to address the opioid epidemic we are now facing,” said Jacob D. Galvan, Acting Special Agent in Charge, DEA Seattle Field Division. “Their actions and investigations helped remove an individual from a position of trust and stop any further harm from happening to vulnerable individuals.”“The FDA oversees the U.S. drug supply to ensure that it is safe and effective, and those who knowingly tamper with medicines put patients’ health at risk,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Robert M. Iwanicki, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office. “We will continue to protect the public health and bring to justice health care professionals who take advantage of their unique position and compromise their patients’ health and comfort by tampering with needed drugs.”This investigation was conducted by the DEA’s Diversion Group in the Seattle Field Office, and the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, Seattle Domicile.

Williams.  Stidham was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment and fined $7500.  He was ordered to forfeit $527,510 of drug proceeds.  He must also serve a three-year term of supervised release after the prison term.  There is no parole in the federal system.“The laws regarding the labeling and dispensing of controlled substances and prescription drugs exist to protect the health and safety of our community, said Acting U.S. Attorney Timothy Duax. When those laws are violated, it endangers those who come into contact with the unprescribed or mislabeled substances. Accordingly, when individuals like Mr. Stidham try to profit by ignoring or violating controlled substance and prescription laws, they will be vigorously prosecuted and the proceeds of their illegal activities will be seized.”“To protect the wellbeing of animals, the FDA regulates animal drugs as part of its mission to protect the public health. This ensures that prescription animal drugs are lawfully distributed and dispensed pursuant to a valid prescription, among other requirements” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L. Grinstead, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Kansas City Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who attempt to evade the law.”Stidham was released on the bond previously set and is to surrender to the Bureau of Prisons on a date yet to be set.The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Patrick J.

Young announced today.According to court documents and statements made in court, Diana Daffin owned and operated a holistic medicine company called Savvy Holistic Health doing business as Holistic Healthy Pet.  In March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) learned that Daffin was selling unapproved drugs on her website, with the brand name HAMPL, that Daffin claimed were COVID-19 remedies and treatments.  In April and August of 2020, the FDA sent Daffin warning letters explaining that various products she was selling—including the HAMPL COVID-19 drugs—were adulterated, misbranded, and unapproved drugs and that she should take immediate action to correct the violation.  Daffin responded by telling the FDA that she removed the products from her website and would stop distributing them.However, Daffin did not stop selling the products.  Instead, she continued to distribute the unapproved COVID-19 drugs and took steps to defraud and mislead the FDA.  For example, she continued to sell unapproved HAMPL brand drugs by moving them to a password protected website, telling one customer that this was her “way of evading the FDA.”In February 2021, Daffin sold an undercover law enforcement officer a HAMPL product that she advertised as a drug that could cure, mitigate, treat, and prevent COVID-19 in humans. In an email leading up to the sale, Daffin told the undercover officer, “This stuff does work for covid, but fda shut it down.”  Daffin later sold and shipped the undercover agent the unapproved HAMPL-brand COVID-19 drug and other unapproved drugs.On March 5, 2021, the undercover agent in New Hampshire received HAMPL drugs sold by Daffin, including the purported COVID-19 remedy.  The label stated that it provided “a stronger immunity against CV” and promised “Immunity for Humans.”Daffin is scheduled to be sentenced on November 2, 2022.This matter was investigated by the United States Food and Drug Administration-Office of Criminal Investigations, Homeland Security Investigations and the United States Postal Inspection Service.  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Matthew T. Hunter and Georgiana L. MacDonald.###On May 17, 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud.

Smith III, 46, of Shawnee, Kansas, waived his right to a grand jury and pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Howard F. Sachs to a federal information that charges him with one count of receiving misbranded drugs (foreign and unapproved Botox) and delivering them for pay with the intent to defraud or mislead, and one count of receiving adulterated devices (Juvederm Ultra 3) and delivering them for pay with the intent to defraud or mislead.Smith owned and operated Tap and Blade, located at 7208 Wornall Road, Suite 206, in Kansas City, Mo. Tap and Blade offered medical services, such as injections of prescription drugs, including Botox, and prescription devices to enhance facial features, including Juvederm Ultra 3. Tap and Blade also offered cosmetic services, such as microblading, brow shading, and cool sculpting. Smith was the only employee of Tap and Blade and performed all the procedures offered at the clinic.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations began investigating Tap and Blade in December 2020 based on information that multiple patients suffered injuries after receiving treatment at Tap and Blade. Agents executed a search warrant at Tap and Blade on April 7, 2021, and found boxes of Juvederm Ultra 3 as well as three syringes filled with Botox.By pleading guilty today, Smith admitted that he obtained Botox and Juvederm Ultra 3 over the internet and without a prescription from a website in China. Smith purchased the products from Alibaba.com because the foreign products were significantly cheaper, which allowed him to lower his cost compared to his competitors and led him to gain more customers.Smith admitted he never told his patients he was using foreign prescription drugs and devices that had not been approved by the FDA. Smith estimated he treated approximately 50 to 60 customers. Smith treated at least 10 patients who suffered a bodily injury after being treated with Juvederm Ultra 3.During the more than three years Tap and Blade operated, from Jan. 1, 2018, to April 30, 2021, there was never a medical doctor associated with the spa, nor was there a doctor overseeing procedures. Smith admitted that he knew his patients should have seen a doctor prior to receiving treatment, and that he told them there was a doctor on staff. Prior to opening Tap and Blade, Smith practiced injections on honeydew fruit, fake heads, and fake skins.The FDA approval of Botox limits the drug to use under the supervision of a licensed practitioner, thus, it is a prescription drug. Smith admitted that the foreign and unapproved Botox he purchased for use at his spa was misbranded because it did not bear adequate directions for use.Upon being injected beneath the skin’s surface, Juvederm adds volume and lift to smooth wrinkles and folds. Juvederm products are regulated as devices because, when injected, they are intended to reside under the skin and do not achieve their primary intended purpose through chemical action or metabolization. The FDA’s approval for Juvederm products limits them to use under the supervision of a licensed practitioner, thus, they are prescription devices. Juvederm Ultra 3 is not legal for distribution in the United States because it lacks FDA approval.Under federal statutes, Smith is subject to a sentence of up to six years in federal prison without parole. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes, as the sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the court based on the advisory sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the United States Probation Office.This case is being prosecuted by Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Bradley Cooper. It was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigation.Component(s):USAO - Missouri, Western"

        "content": "Department of JusticeMiddle District of FloridaFORIMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, July 20, 2022Jacksonville, Florida – Chief U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Corrigan has sentenced Monique Elizabeth Carter (36, Middleburg) to one year and one day in federal prison for tampering with a consumer product, specifically, injectable fentanyl. The court further ordered that after serving her prison sentence, Carter will serve one year of home detention as a condition of a two-year term of supervised release. During this time, Carter will also be prohibited from working in any position in which she would have access to prescribed medications. Carter had pleaded guilty on April 13, 2022.According to court documents, Carter is a registered nurse who had previously been employed by a hospital in Jacksonville. She worked in a neural intensive care unit or ICU, which is a specialized unit that provides intensive and specialized care to critically ill patients with life-threatening neurological problems. Certain ICU patients were prescribed intravenous doses of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid used as a pain medication and as anesthesia.After Carter’s shift on September 28, 2021, a hospital pharmacist examined the ICU wing’s inventory of fentanyl and found a fentanyl syringe with a tamper-proof cap missing, but with some form of foreign adhesive remaining at the tip. A second fentanyl syringe had a cap that appeared to have been glued back on. After reviewing hospital records, a pharmacist supervisor noted a pattern of Carter checking out doses of fentanyl for patients, but then cancelling the transactions and checking syringes back into the hospital’s inventory. Records showed that Carter did so 24 times between August 29 and September 28, 2021. Carter was the only nurse on her ICU wing who persistently checked out fentanyl and returned it to the hospital’s inventory.The next day, when Carter arrived for work, hospital representatives interviewed her. Confronted with the pharmacists’ findings, Carter eventually admitted that—to obtain drugs for personal use at home—she had been removing injectable fentanyl from syringes, replacing the drug with saline, and then gluing the plastic tampering caps back on the syringes with an adhesive that she obtained from the hospital. She admitted that she had been tampering with fentanyl syringes since the summer of 2021. Carter denied injecting fentanyl while on duty at the hospital, but in her bag, law enforcement investigators later located needles, saline syringes, and adhesive.Carter is a trained healthcare professional and knew that her activities likely resulted in critically ill patients receiving diluted fentanyl, which was not safe and effective. Having been deprived of sterile, medically necessary medication, such patients were exposed to possible infection and endured unnecessary pain and suffering. In addition, Carter knew that the failure to anesthetize or control pain in ICU patients can result in increased risks of illness or death, stemming from, among other things, respiratory, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal complications.This case was investigated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations and the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office – Pharmaceutical Diversion and Designer Drug Unit attached to the North Florida High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area.

Jolly, Kenold Million, and Pietro Felipe Sinclair each to 28 months in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release.  In addition, Judge Smith ordered the defendants to pay over $470,000 in restitution.Jolly and Million worked for a large medical supply company that provides personal protective equipment (PPE) and other products to hospitals for front-line health care workers. Sinclair worked for the trucking company that the medical supply company used to transport pallets of products to South Florida hospitals. In April 2020, during the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, when PPE was in high demand, Jolly and Million used their jobs at the medical supply company’s warehouse in Sunrise, Florida to steal PPE.  They moved pallets containing large quantities of N-95 respirator masks, nitrile medical gloves, and gowns to certain areas of the warehouse.  Sinclair would load the pallets onto his work truck (along with legitimate loads) and transport the stolen PPE to Jolly and Million’s home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  Once there, Sinclair transferred the stolen pallets from the truck to the home’s carport.  He used pieces of cardboard and furniture to hide the pallets from view.  Then, rental trucks and vans were used to move the stolen PPE from Jolly and Million’s home to different locations in Broward and Miami-Dade.Jolly, Million and Sinclair stole more than 8.5 million pairs of gloves, more than 57,000 respirator masks, and dozens of gowns from the medical supply company’s warehouse.

Pham used the moniker “addy4cheap” on darknet markets, the Empire Market and Cryptonia.

        "content": "Department of JusticeSouthern District of New YorkFORIMMEDIATE RELEASEMonday, July 11, 2022Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced that defendant SETH FISHMAN, DVM, received a sentence of 11 years in prison today for his role at the helm of an approximately twenty-year scheme to manufacture, market, and sell to racehorse trainers and others in the racehorse industry “untestable” performance enhancing drugs for use in professional horseracing. FISHMAN was one of over thirty defendants charged in four separate cases in March 2020, each arising from this Office’s multi-year investigation of the abuse of racehorses through the use of performance enhancing drugs.U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “The sentence today sends a strong message that those looking to profit from the sale of illegal drugs intended to corruptly dope racehorses stand to face serious consequences for their crimes. The defendant earned his livelihood in service of greed and animal abuse, and will face a steep price for his crimes.”According to the allegations contained in the Superseding Indictment, prior charging instruments, other filings in this case, and as established by the evidence at trial:[1]FISHMAN was charged in United States v. Navarro, 20 Cr. 160 (MKV), a case arising from an investigation of widespread schemes by c others to manufacture, distribute, and receive adulterated and misbranded PEDs and to secretly administer those PEDs to racehorses competing at all levels of professional horseracing. By evading PED prohibitions and deceiving regulators and horse racing officials, participants in these schemes sought to improve race performance and obtain prize money from racetracks throughout the United States and other countries, including in New York, New Jersey, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky, and the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”), all to the detriment and risk of the health and well-being of the racehorses.  Trainers who participated in the schemes stood to profit from the success of racehorses under their control by earning a share of their horses’ winnings, and by improving their horses’ racing records, thereby yielding higher trainer fees and increasing the number of racehorses under their control. Indicted veterinarians profited from the sale and administration of these medically unnecessary, misbranded, and adulterated substances. FISHMAN, acting as the manufacturer and distributor of customized PEDs designed specifically to evade anti-doping controls, reaped millions of dollars from the sale of his drugs to trainers around the United States and across the globe.FISHMAN specifically targeted clients in the racehorse industry, peddling dozens of unsafe and untested drugs that purported to have performance-enhancing effects on racehorses.  FISHMAN created and marketed these drugs as “untestable” under typical anti-doping drug screens and extolled the virtues of these illegal drugs by describing his method of creating customized products for individual customers in order to silo product lines to reduce the likelihood that detection of doping by trainer would undermine the remainder of FISHMAN’s corrupt clientele.In the course of nearly twenty years during which he operated his doping company, Equestology, FISHMAN took additional efforts to mislead and lie to regulatory authorities in an effort to shield his illegal activity. FISHMAN incorporated a sham business in Panama designed to appear as if his drug operation was outside the jurisdiction of U.S. authorities; he pressured employees to sign non-disclosure agreements intended to gag them if questioned by regulators; he designed labels that would provide no hint as to the provenance of the unsafe drugs shipped across the country; and he lied to state investigators regarding the nature of his business when asked directly about his role in Equestology during a Delaware state investigation in 2011, while also bragging to others that he had called in a “personal political favor” to quash that investigation.While claiming to practice as a legitimate veterinarian, FISHMAN used his veterinary license as another form of cover for his illegal drug manufacturing business. In fact, FISHMAN sold illicit drugs, including prescription drugs, under sham prescriptions for animals that he never saw or discussed. Those drugs included intravenous and intramuscular injectables that FISHMAN sold to laypeople for injection into the horses under their purported “care,” many of which were seized at premises throughout the country at the time of the original indictments in this case, including barns located in New York. Those included “blood building” drugs (for example, “BB3” and other Epogen-mimetic substances), vasodilators (for example, “VO2Max”), and bags filled with scores of “bleeder pills,” each designed to covertly increase performance in affected horses.FISHMAN, 51, of Florida, was convicted at trial of two counts of participation in drug adulteration and misbranding conspiracies, the first in connection with the doping operation of convicted co-defendant Jorge Navarro, and the second in connection with the operation of Equestology, which included FISHMAN’s continuation of that offense even following his release on bail after his initial arrest in October 2019.*                *                 *Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI New York Office’s Eurasian Organized Crime Task Force and its support of the Bureau’s Integrity in Sports and Gaming Initiative. Mr. Williams also thanked the Food and Drug Administration and Customs and Border Protection for their assistance and expertise. This case is being handled by the Office’s Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit.  Assistant United States Attorneys Sarah Mortazavi and Anden Chow are in charge of the prosecution.________________________________________[1] As to Fishman’s co-defendants, these facts, including the entirety of the texts of the Indictments and the descriptions of the Indictments set forth herein, constitute only allegations and every fact described should be treated as an allegation.Component(s):USAO - New York, SouthernContact:Nicholas Biase (212) 637-2600Press Release Number:22-220"

        "content": "Department of JusticeNorthern District of CaliforniaFORIMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, July 27, 2022Jury Concludes Balwani Conspired to Perpetrate Fraudulent Scheme on Theranos Investors and PatientsSAN JOSE - A federal jury found Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani guilty of two counts of conspiracy and ten counts of wire fraud though a multi-million-dollar scheme to defraud investors and patients in connection with the operations of Theranos, Inc., announced United States Attorney Stephanie M. Hinds; Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agent in Charge Sean Ragan; Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations Catherine A Hermsen; and U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) San Francisco Division Acting Inspector-In-Charge Kevin Rho. The verdicts follow a trial that began March 9, 2022, before the Honorable Edward J. Davila, United States District Judge, and concluded just over 6 months after a jury found Elizabeth A. Holmes guilty of one count of conspiracy and three counts of wire fraud in related proceedings.“Six months after the guilty verdicts in the Elizabeth Holmes trial, this jury has concluded that Holmes’s business partner, Ramesh Balwani, also bears responsibility for defrauding investors in Theranos,” said U.S. Attorney Hinds. \"The jury concluded that Balwani also perpetrated fraud on unsuspecting patients. I want to thank the jury for dutifully navigating through the complex issues presented by this case. In this trial, it took four months for the parties to present their evidence and argument, all the while wading through the additional challenges presented by the Coronavirus pandemic. We are gratified by the jury’s hard work and attentiveness to the evidence presented. We appreciate the verdict and look forward to sentencing proceedings.”“Once again, a jury has determined that the fraud at Theranos reached the level of a criminal conspiracy,\" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Sean Ragan. \"The FBI has spent years investigating this investment fraud scheme with our partners at USPIS and the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations. Lies, deceit, and criminal actions cannot replace innovation and success.”“Medical product fraud jeopardizes patient health,” said FDA Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations Catherine A Hermsen. “This defendant joins his partner in being found guilty of fraud related to diagnostic tests. The FDA will vigilantly investigate and bring to justice individuals and companies responsible for putting the public health at risk.”USPIS Acting Inspector-in-Charge Rho said “I want to thank the FBI, the FDA-Office of Criminal Investigations, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California for the extraordinary teamwork supporting this verdict. Postal Inspectors have been investigating snake oil and investment fraud schemes for more than a hundred years, and we remain committed to uncovering criminal frauds with these partners.”Balwani, 57, of Atherton, was employed at Theranos from September of 2009 through July of 2016. The blood testing company based in Palo Alto and Newark, Calif., was founded by Holmes, 38, of Woodside, Calif., in 2003. While employed with Theranos, Balwani worked for the company in several capacities, including as a member of the company’s board of directors, as its president, and as its chief operating officer. At trial, the government submitted evidence that while at Theranos Balwani conspired to commit wire fraud against investors between 2010 and 2015, conspired to commit wire fraud between 2013 and 2016 against patients who paid for Theranos’ blood testing services, and that he committed wire fraud against investors and patients.With respect to the conspiracy charges, the government submitted evidence regarding Balwani’s claims that Theranos developed a revolutionary and proprietary analyzer that the defendants referred to by various names, including as the TSPU, Edison, or minilab. Balwani and Holmes claimed the analyzer was able to perform a full range of clinical tests using small blood samples drawn from a finger stick. They also represented that the analyzer could produce results that were more accurate and reliable than those yielded by conventional methods—all at a faster speed than previously possible. At trial, the government demonstrated that Holmes and Balwani knew that many of their representations about the analyzer were false, but nevertheless conspired to convince potential investors and patients that the claims were true. For example, Holmes, Balwani, and others knew that the analyzer had accuracy and reliability problems, performed a limited number of tests, was slower than some competing devices, and, in some respects, could not compete with existing, more conventional machines.Similarly, with respect to the substantive fraud charges, the evidence demonstrated Balwani used advertisements and solicitations to encourage and induce patients to use Theranos’s blood testing laboratory services, even though he knew Theranos was not capable of consistently producing accurate and reliable results for certain blood tests.Evidence showed that Balwani represented to investors that Theranos would generate over $100 million in revenues and break even in 2014 and that Theranos expected to generate approximately $1 billion in revenues in 2015. In truth, Theranos resorted to using conventional machines bought from third parties to perform much of Theranos’s blood testing and Balwani knew Theranos would generate only negligible or modest revenues in 2014 and 2015. The trial evidence included numerous misrepresentations made by Balwani to potential investors about Theranos’s financial condition and its future prospects. In addition, the evidence showed that Balwani represented to investors that Theranos would dramatically increase the number of Wellness Centers within Walgreens stores even though Theranos’s retail Walgreens rollout had stalled because of several issues.On July 28, 2020, a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging Balwani with two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349, and ten counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343. Like Holmes, Balwani was charged with conspiring to commit wire fraud against investors in Theranos during the period 2010 to 2015, conspiring to commit wire fraud against patients who paid for Theranos’ blood testing services during the period 2013 to 2016, and ten counts of wire fraud in violation of Section 1343 of Title 18 of the United States Code. Six of the wire fraud counts involved fraud against investors in Theranos while the remaining four involved wire fraud against patients who paid for Theranos’ blood testing services and advertising purchased by Theranos to attract those patients. Pursuant to today’s verdicts, Balwani was found guilty on all counts.Balwani remains free on bond pending further hearings. Judge Davila scheduled Balwani’s sentencing hearing for November 15, 2022. Balwani faces a maximum sentence of twenty (20) years in prison, and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution, for each count of conspiracy and each count of wire fraud. However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. § 3553.In a separate trial, a separate jury convicted Holmes on January 3, 2022, of the investor-related conspiracy count and three counts of wire fraud. That jury acquitted Holmes of the patient-related conspiracy wire fraud count and three additional wire fraud counts; in addition, one count of wire fraud relating to a Theranos patient was dismissed during Holmes’s trial. The jury could not reach a unanimous verdict in her trial with respect to three investor fraud-related counts. Judge Davila scheduled Holmes’s sentencing for September 26, 2022.Assistant U.S. Attorneys Robert S. Leach, Jeff Schenk, John C. Bostic, and Kelly Volkar are prosecuting the case with the assistance of Lakisha Holliman, Madeline Wachs, Elise Etter, Susan Kreider, Leeya Kekona, Sara Slattery and Sutton Peirce. The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the FBI, USPIS, and FDA Office of Criminal Investigations.Component(s):USAO - California, Northern"

Ross.  When sentenced, Kamaldoss faces up to 50 years in prison.Breon Peace, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, announced the verdict.“The defendant is now a convicted drug dealer.  He lined his pockets off the black-market sales of millions of illegal opioids and misbranded prescription pills without regard for the harm caused by the abuse of these highly addictive and dangerous drugs,” stated United States Attorney Peace.  “With today’s verdict, the defendant is held accountable for having a hand in every aspect of his pill mill, from the importing of unapproved medications from India, to personally filling orders for these drugs for customers throughout the country.”Mr. Peace thanked the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, Metro Washington Field Office; United States Postal Inspection Service, New York Division; Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), New York Division; U.S. Customs and Border Protection, New York Field Office, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, New England Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Cincinnati Field Office; and HSI, Baltimore Field Office; for their outstanding investigative work on the case.The evidence at trial proved that between May 2018 and August 2019, Kamaldoss participated with others in a transnational drug-trafficking conspiracy, which involved the importation of misbranded prescription drugs, including Tramadol, a synthetic opioid, into the United States from India, re-packaging the drugs at a pill mill operating out of a warehouse in Jamaica, Queens, and shipping the drugs via United States mail to customers throughout the United States.  During the course of the charged conspiracy, Kamaldoss and the men who worked for him distributed millions of Tramadol pills sometimes purchasing hundreds of thousands of pills at a time.  Additionally, Kamaldoss conspired to launder the proceeds of the drug-trafficking operation by using the illicit profits to reinvest in the business, including by paying shipping costs incurred by his co-conspirators—including nearly $200,000 in Federal Express costs paid off in exchange for additional pills.The government’s evidence included testimony from a cooperating witness, who admitted to bribing workers at John F. Kennedy International Airport to evade detection by law enforcement authorities; members of law enforcement, one of whom testified that he witnessed the defendant shipping packages and seized some of the drugs mailed by the defendant; testimony from an expert in forensic chemistry that the drugs mailed by the defendant contained Tramadol and Alprazolam; documentary exhibits, including hundreds of emails, text messages, and spreadsheets recovered from email accounts and electronic devices of the defendant and his co-conspirators reflecting their daily receipt of dozens of drug orders, and their responses including tracking numbers of the shipments fulfilling the orders; and an audio recording made by a confidential informant of co-defendant Velaudapillai Navaratnarajah discussing the number and type of pills to package into envelopes.  Navaratnarajah pleaded guilty in June 2022 to the drug conspiracy charges and is awaiting sentencing.The government’s case is being handled by the Office’s International Narcotics and Money Laundering Section.  Assistant United States Attorneys Robert M. Pollack and Margaret Schierberl are in charge of the prosecution, with the assistance of paralegal Sophia Cronin.The Defendant:EZHIL SEZHIAN KAMALDOSS (also known as “Kamaldoss Sezhian,” “Kamal Doss,” and Ezhil Cezhian”)Age:  43Richmond Hill, New YorkE.D.N.Y.

FDA investigators asked Figueroa to disclose all products that Pharmatech had manufactured after it resumed manufacturing. Figueroa lied to the FDA investigators by, among other things, knowingly excluding Diocto Liquid from its products list (even though Pharmatech shipped over 7,000 units of the drug earlier that month) and by falsely stating to the FDA that Pharmatech’s new water system had met “acceptance criteria,” which was not true.In July 2017, the CDC notified the FDA of multiple cases of B. cepacia infections in pediatric patients at Stanford Children’s Health Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital in Palo Alto, California and Johns Hopkins Children’s Center in Baltimore, Maryland. FDA investigated and collected bottles of Diocto Liquid from these medical centers.  The collected bottles were from the same lot that Pharmatech distributed in March 2017 – the same lot that Pharmatech failed to disclose to the FDA.  Several of the bottles contained total aerobic microbial counts and total yeast and mold counts in excess of acceptable limits and some of the bottles also tested positive for the presence of B. cepacia.Juan Antonio Gonzalez, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and Justin C. Fielder, Special Agent in Charge, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations Miami Field Office, made the announcement.The FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Miami Field Office investigated the case.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Deric Zacca is prosecuting this case, with assistance from Laura Akowuah, from FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel.Related court documents and information may be found on the website of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida at www.flsd.uscourts.gov or at http://pacer.flsd.uscourts.gov, under case number 22-cr-60033.###Topic(s):Consumer ProtectionHealth Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - Florida, SouthernContact:Marlene Rodriguez Special Counsel to the U.S. Attorney Public Affairs Officer USAFLS.News@usdoj.gov"

Sellinger announced.Muhammad Mirza, 50, of Cedar Grove, New Jersey; Devon Burt, 49, of Blue Bell, Pennsylvania; and Hallum Gelzer, 43, of East Orange, New Jersey, were charged by complaint with conspiracy to commit health care fraud in Newark federal court. Punson Figueroa, aka “Susie Figueroa,” 55, of Long Island City, New York, was charged in the same complaint with 15 counts of health care fraud. The defendants appeared by videoconference today before U.S. Magistrate Judge James B. Clark III and were released on $200,000 unsecured bond.According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:From 2019 to the present, Mirza, Figueroa, Gelzer, Burt, and others recruited Amtrak employees – primarily from New Jersey and New York – to participate in the scheme through the offer of cash payments, in exchange for the employees agreeing to allow Mirza, Figueroa, and others to use their patient and insurance information to submit fraudulent claims. Mirza, Figueroa, and others benefitted from this scheme by receiving payments from the Amtrak health care plan for services that were never provided or that were medically unnecessary. Gelzer, Burt, and others benefitted from this scheme by receiving cash payments from providers in return for allowing those providers to use their personal and insurance information to submit fraudulent claims and in return for recruiting others to participate in the scheme.On June 17, 2021, an undercover law enforcement agent posing as an Amtrak employee met with Figueroa at Figueroa’s office in New York. Figueroa instructed the undercover agent to sign his name about 30 times for services received and instructed the undercover agent not to date the signatures. Figueroa stated to the undercover agent that the undercover agent had good insurance, and that Amtrak has very good benefits. Figueroa submitted or caused to be submitted false claims to Amtrak’s health care plan indicating that the undercover agent had visited providers at least seven times in May 2021, purportedly receiving acupuncture and physical therapy services.The undercover agent visited Figueroa’s office on only one other occasion, on July 29, 2021. At this meeting, which was recorded on audio and video, Figueroa handed the undercover agent an envelope filled with $1,000. Figueroa continued to use the undercover agent’s personal and insurance information to submit fraudulent claims to the Amtrak health care plan, for a total of 73 claims. As a result of these fraudulent claims, the Amtrak health care plan paid $31,840.In total, the Amtrak health care plan has paid at least approximately $9 million as a result of claims associated with providers connected to the health care fraud scheme.The conspiracy and health care fraud charges each carry a maximum potential penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense, whichever is greatest.U.S. Attorney Sellinger credited special agents of the Amtrak Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Michael J. Waters; special agents of the  Drug Enforcement Administration, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Frank A.

In January 2017, Mighty Stacks, LLC, did business through Blue Brain Boost and sold products through the website bluebrainboost.com. The business sold products identified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as misbranded and unapproved new drugs, including Tianeptine Sodium Powder, a dangerous unapproved drug that the FDA has warned is linked with risk of abuse, particularly in those with a history of opioid use disorder and overdose. Some people have turned to tianeptine as an opioid alternative, or to self-treat anxiety or depression. The Goddings also illegally sold multiple other unapproved and misbranded drugs, including adrafinil crystalline powder, aniracetam crystalline powder nicotine solution, IDRA-21, methylene blue solution, noopept crystalline powder, oxiracetam, phenibut hydrocholoride crystalline powder, coluracetam chrystalline powder, phenylpiracetam crystalline powder, pramiracetam, and sunifiram. The Blue Brain Boost website identified its products as “nootropics,” a term widely used to market unapproved products as “smart drugs” and “cognitive enhancers.” The defendants purchased these drugs from China and repackaged and distributed them for consumer use.The defendants fraudulently misled customers by advertising that their products were tested by independent labs and asserted that they were “compulsive” about quality control. In fact, they rarely tested any of their products before selling them to consumers, even after receiving complaints of side effects. One customer wrote to the company: “The batch I just received I am getting multiple reports from my clients that it causes vomiting.” Another customer wrote in, “After administering a single dose, he noticed a rapid heart rate, a pressure in brain and rapid breathing. The customer vomited out the product. He noted the smell and flavor were not quite right.”The FDA has identified many nootropics as unapproved new drugs and has issued numerous warning letters and online advisory letters emphasizing that such products have not been proven safe and/or effective and could potentially prevent a person from seeking medical help for a serious medical condition.Mark Godding pleaded guilty on January 26, 2022, before United States District Court Chief Judge Philip A. Brimmer, who sentenced him to six months in federal prison on May 20, 2022. Linda Godding pleaded guilty on January 27, 2022, before Judge Brimmer. He sentenced her to six months in federal prison on June 10, 2022.“The defendants knowingly, intentionally, and repeatedly placed customers at risk, and they undermined and evaded the extensive regulations put in place to protect those consumers,” said U.S. Attorney Cole Finegan. “Their sentences should send a message to other businesses that we will hold you accountable if you disregard the law and threaten public health.”“Prescription drugs that are smuggled from overseas and are outside the secure supply chain can present a serious health risk to those who use them. The drugs may contain unknown or dangerous ingredients and are manufactured under unknown or unregulated conditions,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L. Grinstead, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Kansas City Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who traffic in illegal prescription drugs.”This case was investigated by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations.Case Number: 21-cr-000345Topic(s):Consumer ProtectionComponent(s):USAO - ColoradoContact:Deborah Takahara Public Affairs Specialist deborah.takahara@usdoj.gov"

        "content": "Department of JusticeWestern District of VirginiaFORIMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, June 8, 2022Settlement is the Third-Largest in History Under the Controlled Substances ActABINGDON, Va. – Sovah Health has agreed to pay the United States $4.36 million to settle claims that the hospital system violated the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) on numerous occasions between 2017 and 2020.  As part of the resolution, Sovah Health further agreed to be subject to a period of four years of increased compliance and oversight during which any failure to comply with its obligations may result in contempt of court findings that could result in additional monetary sanctions and injunctive relief.  The settlement is the third-largest civil penalty ever obtained from a hospital system under the Controlled Substances Act and the largest ever in the Fourth Circuit.The claims center around Sovah Health’s failure to have effective controls in place to prevent the diversion of powerful painkilling prescription opioids. Sovah Health is a regional health care delivery system comprised of a hospital with two campuses - Danville and Martinsville. In 2017, Danville (formerly Danville Regional Medical Center) and Martinsville (formerly Memorial Hospital of Martinsville & Henry County) united to form Sovah Health.From 2017 to 2019, a Sovah Health employee diverted more than 11,000 Schedule II controlled substances from Sovah Health. From January to May 2020 a second Sovah Health employee tampered with Fentanyl vials and hydromorphone injectables by replacing the controlled substance with saline and diverting the controlled substance. The United States alleged Sovah Health failed to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against the diversion of controlled substances, filled orders for controlled substances without a system in place to disclose suspicious orders of controlled substances, and failed to maintain readily retrievable records of controlled substances.“As opioid overdose deaths skyrocket, it is critical that health care companies are held accountable when they fail to effectively safeguard these powerful prescriptions within their facilities,” said U.S.  Attorney Christopher R. Kavanaugh for the Western District of Virginia. “The oversight provided by this resolution will ensure future compliance involving these important but potentially deadly substances, and the United States Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia will continue to vigorously pursue these cases with our federal and local partners in order to protect Virginia’s communities.”“Today's settlement sends a clear message to all registrants that it is essential to maintain effective controls to prevent the diversion of controlled substances” said DEA Washington Division Special Agent in Charge Jarod Forget.  “DEA is dedicated to combat the prescription drug abuse problem in Virginia and throughout the country and to hold all DEA registrants accountable.\"“The FDA oversees the U.S. drug supply to ensure that patients receive medicines that are safe and effective,” said Special Agent in Charge George A. Scavdis of the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office. “We will continue to protect the public health by holding accountable health care companies that fail to safeguard their prescription drug inventory and thereby compromise their patients’ health and comfort.”“With opioid deaths and overdoses at record-breaking highs, especially across Southside Virginia, there must be zero tolerance of trusted health professionals engaging in drug diversion,” said Colonel Gary T. Settle, Virginia State Police Superintendent. “For the safety and protection of Virginia's communities, our Virginia State Police Drug Diversion special agents, in collaboration with our local and federal public safety partners, will continue to aggressively pursue investigations related to the illegal distribution of Fentanyl and other prescription drugs.”The agreement, which is available here, resolves Sovah Health’s potential civil and criminal liability based on the investigation. As part of the resolution, Sovah Health has committed to additional compliance measures including, but not limited to, having cameras at all Automated Dispensing Machines to capture the activity of placing/removing controlled substances; promptly reporting losses and diversion of controlled substances; taking and reporting disciplinary action taken against employees found to have been responsible for theft, diversion or loss of controlled substances; maintaining a mandatory random drug testing program for employees; and conducting a full physical inventory of all federally scheduled II-V controlled substances more frequently than required by law.Assistant U.S. Attorneys Justin Lugar and Randy Ramseyer represented the United States in this matter.The investigation was conducted by the Food and Drug Administration - Office of Criminal Investigations, the Drug Enforcement Administration – Roanoke Resident Office Diversion Group, and the Virginia State Police.Topic(s):OpioidsComponent(s):USAO - Virginia, Western"

Estes, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia. The charges subject Federuik and Nicholls to possible statutory penalties of a minimum of 10 years in prison, up to life, along with fines of up to $10 million and a minimum of five years of supervised release after completion of any prison term.“The number of deaths from drug overdoses, particularly Fentanyl and its analogues, has reached a record high in the United States and every citizen of this country should be alarmed.  The prevalence of this drug is, in large part, fueled by an illicit pipeline of illegally imported drugs,” said U.S. Attorney Estes. “This investigation sought to trace that pipeline to its source to cut off its flow to our country in an effort to protect our citizens from harm.”The investigation, dubbed Operation Canada1, began in October 2017 with the separate deaths of two U.S. Navy petty officers in Kingsland, Ga., that were attributed to Fentanyl-related drug overdoses. The source of the drugs was traced to a Dark Web vendor using Canadian-postmarked packaging labeled “East Van Eco Tours,” leading investigators from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the Calgary Police Service to target the Dark Web vendor Canada1.The indictment alleges that Federuik and Nicholls conspired to import drugs from places including China and Hungary. Then, using business names including “East Van Eco Tours” and “Bridge City Consulting LLP,” the alleged conspirators distributed those drugs through the Dark Web in the Southern District of Georgia and elsewhere in the United States. The indictment further alleges that a shipment of those drugs packaged by the conspirators traveled from Canada to Kingsland, resulting in the deaths of B.J.T. and T.L.B. in October 2017.Federuik and Nicholls have been taken into custody and are awaiting extradition proceedings to bring them to the Southern District of Georgia.Criminal indictments contain only charges; defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.“The metrics of the opioid crisis are staggering,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin C. Fielder, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Miami Field Office. “We will continue to take decisive action to curtail the illegal distribution of opioids and other addictive prescription drugs, bringing to justice criminals who endanger the public’s health.”“The importation and distribution of illicit narcotics within the United States pose a significant threat not only to our local communities but also our nation’s service members and ultimately our national security,” said Special Agent in Charge Thomas Cannizzo of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service Southeast Field Office. “Upon initiating this investigation, NCIS quickly recognized the incredible benefit of our valued collaboration with U.S. and international law enforcement partners. We are grateful for their extraordinary efforts to bring to justice those responsible for importing and distributing the illicit narcotics that led to the tragic overdose deaths of two U.S. Sailors.”“This poison ultimately led to the deaths of two servicemembers and destroyed the lives of countless others,” said Special Agent in Charge Katrina W. Berger, who oversees Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) operations in Georgia and Alabama. “Stopping drug traffickers takes a team, and I’m proud of the work done by HSI and its law enforcement partners working together to stop this destructive epidemic.”“The opioid crisis is affecting countless families in our communities, even those who would not otherwise be deemed at risk,” said Superintendent Richard Bergevin, Officer in Charge of the BC RCMP Federal Serious and Organized Crime Major Projects teams. “This investigation showcases the great work that is being done by our teams, using traditional as well as innovative investigative techniques, to combat the sale and distribution of these deadly drugs.”“Pills in the underground drug market and on the Dark Web are often diluted with dangerous and deadly substances like fentanyl, as was the case in this investigation,” said Robert J. Murphy, the Special Agent in Charge of the DEA Atlanta Field Division. “There is no quality control in the process, so there’s a high chance that users will receive a deadly dose of fentanyl. The success of this investigation was made possible because of the collaborative efforts between all law enforcement agencies involved.”“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service’s objectives are to preserve the integrity of the nation’s mail system from criminal misuse, rid the mail of illicit drugs, and to keep our communities safe,” said Juan A. Vargas, Acting Inspector in Charge of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service Miami Division. “Postal Inspectors will work with our law enforcement partners to combine resources and expertise to achieve a common goal, which is to combat the perils of illegal and dangerous drug distribution and ensure perpetrators of such attempts are brought to justice.”The case is being investigated in Canada by U.S. Homeland Security Investigations, Vancouver; the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and its Online Undercover Operations Unit and Federal Serious and Organized Crime Unit, Cybercrime Operations Group; Calgary Police Service; and the Canada Border Service Agency; in the United Kingdom assistance was provided by the National Extradition Unit with the Metropolitan Police and the Staffordshire Police; and in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations; the U.S. Naval Criminal Investigative Service; Homeland Security Investigations Savannah; the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration; and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, with assistance from the U.S. Marshals Service.

        "content": "Department of JusticeMiddle District of North CarolinaFORIMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, June 1, 2022GREENSBORO – Emilee Kathryn Poteat, 32, of Danville, Virginia, was sentenced today to 54 months in prison for tampering with a consumer product, announced United States Attorney Sandra J. Hairston.The Poteat indictment, filed in June 2021, charges that from on or about July 1, 2020, continuing up to and including on or about October 28, 2020, the defendant did, with reckless disregard for the risk that another person would be placed in danger of bodily injury and under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to such risk, tamper and attempt to tamper with a consumer product that affected interstate commerce to wit: three syringes of injectable hydromorphone, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §1365(a)(4).According to court documents, from July to November 2020, Poteat -- a registered nurse – was employed as a contract nurse in the Clinical Pre/Post Procedure Unit (“CPPU”) at Novant Health Forsyth Medical Center (“NHFMC”) in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. In that capacity Poteat was authorized to access the Pyxes machine located in the CPPU of NHFMC for the purpose of dispensing controlled substances, including injectable Hydromorphone, to patients at the direction of prescribing doctors.A Pyxes machine is a device used to securely store controlled medications and prevent unauthorized access to such substances. Controlled substances are stored in locked drawers which require entry of both a fingerprint and a password before authorized medical personal can open the drawers to withdraw a controlled substance. Further, a nurse or other authorized person must enter specific prescription information for an actual patient to access prescribed substances secured in the Pyxes machine. Vials of drugs stored in the Pyxes machine at NHFMC were held in container packages with each individual vial sealed with tamper evident seals and caps.From July 2020 through November 2020, Poteat opened container packages containing vials of injectable Hydromorphone that were stored in the Pyxes machine located in the CPPU at NHFMC. She then removed the vials from those container packages and opened the vials for the purpose of converting and consuming the Hydromorphone by injecting the drug into herself.After removing and converting injectable Hydromorphone, Poteat injected saline solution into the vials so as to conceal her conversion of the drugs and replaced the lids of the vials with glue. Poteat then placed the tampered-with vials which were filled with saline solution into the opened container packages, closed and re-sealed the container packages, and then left those container packages in the locked and secured Pyxes machine -- knowing that CPPU nurses might administer the compromised and tampered-with vials of injectable Hydromorphone to surgical patients in the CPPU at NHFCMC, despite the fact that such vials did not contain the drug and were filled with potentially contaminated saline solution.Poteat was ordered to pay a $3,000 fine and will face three years of supervised release in addition to her 4-1/2 year prison sentence.This case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Frank J. Chut, Jr. The United States Food and Drug Administration investigated the case.###Component(s):USAO - North Carolina, Middle"

        "content": "Department of JusticeSouthern District of CaliforniaFORIMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, May 27, 2022SAN DIEGO – Jennings Ryan Staley, a physician who attempted to profit from the pandemic by marketing what he described as a “miracle cure” for COVID-19, was sentenced today to 30 days of custody and one year of home confinement for trying to smuggle hydroxychloroquine into the United States to sell in his coronavirus “treatment kits.”Last year, Staley pleaded guilty to one count of importation contrary to law, admitting that he worked with a Chinese supplier to try to smuggle into the United States a barrel that he believed contained over 26 pounds of hydroxychloroquine powder by mislabeling it as “yam extract.” According to court documents, Staley also suggested this mislabeling technique to another supplier who declined, telling Staley, “sorry, we must do it legally.”Staley admitted that he intended to sell the hydroxychloroquine powder in capsules as part of his business venture selling COVID-19 “treatment kits” in March and April 2020, at the beginning of the global pandemic. According to sentencing documents, Staley also solicited investors for his scheme, promising one that he could “triple your money in 90 days.”In his plea agreement, Staley admitted to writing a hydroxychloroquine prescription for one of his employees, misusing the employee’s name and personal identifying information. To fill the prescription for the increasingly scarce drug, Staley proceeded to answer pharmacists’ questions as though he were the employee, all without the employee’s knowledge or consent.Staley marketed and sold his COVID-19 “treatment kits” to customers of his Skinny Beach Med Spas in and around San Diego.  Court documents relate that law enforcement began investigating Staley after receiving several tips from concerned citizens sparked by his marketing campaign. According to admissions in his plea agreement, Staley described his products—which included hydroxychloroquine—as a “one hundred percent” cure, a “magic bullet,” an “amazing weapon,” and “almost too good to be true” in conversations with an undercover FBI agent posing as a potential customer, and Staley stated that the products would provide at least six weeks of immunity. Staley acknowledged that these statements were material to the potential customer, and that as a doctor he abused a position of public trust and used a special skill in carrying out his scheme.An undercover agent purchased six of Staley’s “treatment kits” for $4,000. Court documents explain that during a recorded phone call with the undercover agent, Staley not only made the false statements about the efficacy of his “treatment kits;” he also bragged that, “I got the last tank of . . . hydroxychloroquine, smuggled out of China, Sunday night at 1:00 a.m. in the morning . . . the broker . . . smuggled it out, so to speak, otherwise tricked Customs by saying it was sweet potato extract.” In a later phone call with the undercover agent, Staley spontaneously offered to throw in doses of generic Viagra and Xanax, which is a federally controlled substance. At no point did Staley ask any medical questions about the undercover agent’s purported family members, including the agent’s three supposed minor children.Staley also admitted that he willfully impeded and sought to obstruct the federal investigation into his conduct by lying to federal agents.  Specifically, when interviewed by law enforcement, Staley falsely denied ever claiming that his “treatment kits” were a “one hundred percent effective cure,” adding “that would be foolish.”  Staley also falsely claimed that his medical practice would “absolutely” get all relevant information about each family member when sending out medications for a family treatment pack, when just a week earlier, he had dispensed a “family pack” of hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, generic Viagra, Xanax, and azithromycin to the undercover agent without collecting any medical information from the agent or the agent’s five supposed family members.U.S. District Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel also ordered Staley to pay a $10,000 fine and ordered forfeiture of the $4,000 paid by the undercover agent, as well as more than 4,500 tablets of various pharmaceutical drugs, multiple bags of empty pill capsules, and a manual capsule-filling machine.“At the height of the pandemic, before vaccines were available, this doctor sought to profit from patients’ fears,” said U.S. Attorney Randy Grossman.  “He abused his position of trust and undermined the integrity of the entire medical profession. We are committed to enforcing the laws of the United States and protecting patients, including prosecuting doctors who choose to commit crimes.” Grossman commended the prosecution team and federal agents from FBI and FDA-OCI, who worked hard pursuing justice in this case.  He also commended U.S. Customs and Border Protection for its assistance with the investigation.“The defendant used a global pandemic to prey on the public’s fear by offering a 'cure' for COVID-19, and then lied to FBI agents about it,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Stacey Moy. “I want to thank our federal partners at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration – Office of Criminal Investigations, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the United States Attorney’s Office for their collective efforts in bringing this defendant to justice.”“The FDA continues to work with its law enforcement partners to protect the public health by identifying, investigating and bringing to justice those who attempt to profit from the pandemic by offering and distributing COVID-19 treatments with unproven ‘miracle cure’ claims to American consumers,” said Special Agent in Charge Lisa L. Malinowski, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office.On May 17, 2021, Attorney General Merrick Garland established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force, led by the Deputy Attorney General, to bring together the full resources of the federal government to bolster fraud enforcement efforts.If you think you are a victim of COVID-19 fraud, immediately report it the FBI (visit ic3.gov, tips.fbi.gov, or call 1-800-CALL-FBI or the San Diego FBI at 858-320-1800; the public is also urged to report suspected fraud schemes related to COVID-19 by calling the National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF) hotline (1-866-720-5721) or by e-mailing the NCDF at disaster@leo.gov.DEFENDANTCase Number 20-CR-1227-GPCJennings Ryan Staley, M.D.                           Age: 44                                   San Diego, CASUMMARY OF CHARGESImportation Contrary to Law, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 545Maximum Penalty: Twenty years in prison; fine; special assessmentAGENCYFederal Bureau of InvestigationU.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Customs and Border ProtectionComponent(s):USAO - California, SouthernContact:Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nicholas Pilchak (619) 546-9709 and Jaclyn Stahl (619) 546-8456Press Release Number:CAS22-0527-Staley,M.D."

        "content": "Department of JusticeWestern District of MichiganFORIMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, May 26, 2022GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN– U.S. Attorney Mark Totten announced today that Alison Renee Marshall, 45, of Sturgis, Michigan, pled guilty in the United States District Court in Lansing, Michigan, to a charge of tampering with a consumer product, specifically vials of liquid fentanyl at the hospital where she worked.According to court documents, Marshall, a registered nurse who previously was employed in the interventional radiology unit of a hospital in Kalamazoo, Michigan, removed liquid fentanyl and replaced it with saline solution in July and August of 2020. On August 20, 2020, another nurse working in the interventional radiology unit recognized that a 72-year-old cancer patient undergoing a percutaneous chest tube placement procedure did not receive the expected pain relief from the liquid fentanyl that was administered at the outset of the procedure. A subsequent investigation by the hospital’s staff pharmacist revealed that several vials of fentanyl in the unit’s automated medication dispensing machines had caps that appeared glued back on the vials.  Hospital records revealed that Marshall checked out doses of fentanyl for patients 14 times from in July and August of 2020 but then canceled the transactions and purportedly returned the fentanyl back into the interventional radiology unit’s inventory. FDA laboratory examination of the vials with the glued caps revealed needle punctures consistent with tampering, and laboratory testing demonstrated that the vials were substantially diluted, containing 3% or less of the amount of reported fentanyl.On August 24, 2020, Marshall met with hospital representatives and admitted diverting fentanyl for her own use by removing vials of injectable fentanyl from the medication dispensing machines, extracting the fentanyl using syringes, replacing the medication with saline, gluing the plastic tampering caps back onto the vials, and returning the vials back into the unit’s medication dispensing machines. At a plea hearing before the United States District Judge Hala Y. Jarbou, Marshall acknowledged that by removing the fentanyl, refilling the vials with saline solution, and returning the vials to the hospital inventory, she acted with reckless disregard that a patient would be placed in danger of death or bodily injury and exhibited extreme indifference to such risk.U.S. Attorney Mark Totten stated, “Patients entering a hospital must have confidence they will receive the treatment they are promised.” He continued, “Marshall violated that trust and exposed vulnerable patients to possible infection and unnecessary pain and suffering. Today’s guilty plea brings us one step closer to accountability and sends a message to other would-be offenders that we will not sit back when they violate patients’ trust.”“Patients rely on the knowledge that they will receive FDA-approved medications to manage their pain,” said Special Agent in Charge Lynda M. Burdelik, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Chicago Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice healthcare professionals who jeopardize patients’ health by tampering with their pain medications.”Marshall’s sentencing is scheduled for September 21, 2022.  Marshall faces a maximum of 10 years in federal prison. The Court will determine the sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.This case was investigated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations.###Topic(s):Prescription DrugsComponent(s):USAO - Michigan, Western"

        "content": "Department of JusticeNorthern District of CaliforniaFORIMMEDIATE RELEASETuesday, May 24, 2022SAN JOSE – Bay Area physician Dr. Roger Wang has agreed to pay $1,033,666.42 to resolve allegations that he violated the False Claims Act by charging Medicare for non-FDA-approved drugs and associated services, announced United States Attorney Stephanie M. Hinds; Special Agent in Charge, Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Steven J. Ryan; and Special Agent in Charge of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Criminal Investigations, Los Angeles Field Office, Lisa L. Malinowski.According to the settlement, viscosupplements, such as Synvisc, Synvisc One, and Orthovisc, are FDA-approved drugs injected for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain. The United States has alleged that Wang, a rheumatology specialist practicing in San Francisco, purchased and injected into his patients versions of Synvisc, Synvisc One, or Orthovisc that were not approved by the FDA for distribution in the United States and therefore were not covered by Medicare, and billed Medicare for the drugs and injections.  The settlement agreement resolves claims the United States might have brought based upon these allegations.“When Medicare pays for drugs and services, the government expects doctors to follow the rules in place to protect patient safety,” said U.S. Attorney Stephanie M. Hinds. “In this case, the rules require doctors seeking reimbursement from Medicare for injecting viscosupplements to use FDA-approved drugs.  This office will hold accountable anyone who seeks to cut corners by defrauding American taxpayers and risking harm to patients by using unapproved medications.”\"Physicians who bill Medicare for ineligible medications and procedures defy basic requirements for their participation in the program and wrongfully attempt to collect taxpayer funds,\" stated HHS-OIG Special Agent in Charge Steven J. Ryan. \"We will continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners to investigate bad actors that cheat federal health care programs and flout their safeguards meant to protect patients’ health and well-being.”“Drugs and devices that are produced and distributed outside the FDA’s oversight present the prospect of harm to the public health,” said Special Agent in Charge Lisa L. Malinowski, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Los Angeles Field Office. “We commend DOJ and HHS-OIG for their commitment to protecting American patients.”According to the settlement, the United States alleged Wang knowingly submitted thousands of false claims for reimbursement for non-FDA-approved Synvisc and Orthovisc and related procedures. Specifically, the United States alleged that Wang used non-FDA-approved drugs that were packaged and labeled for use in foreign markets. At least some of the labeling, according to the settlement, was for additional uses not approved in the United States. In addition, the United States alleged that, from June 30, 2015, to December 1, 2019, Wang knowingly submitted claims to Medicare for reimbursement for non-FDA-approved Synvisc and Orthovisc, and for injection procedures, even though neither the non-FDA-approved drugs nor the injections of those drugs are covered by Medicare. Pursuant to the settlement, the United States agreed to resolve the government’s claims resulting from Wang’s conduct, including the government’s claims under the False Claims Act, codified at 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733, and certain other related claims, for more than $1 million.The claims resolved by this settlement are allegations only and there has been no determination of liability.Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Pyle is handling the matter. The settlement is the result of an investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, and the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations.Attachment(s):Download Fully Executed Settlement AgreementComponent(s):USAO - California, Northern"

        "content": "Department of JusticeSouthern District of FloridaFORIMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, May 20, 2022Miami, Florida – A federal district judge in Miami has sentenced each of three South Florida residents to 220 months in prison after a jury found them guilty of orchestrating an elaborate fraud scheme that cheated U.S. manufacturers of infant formula, eye-care products, and other FDA-regulated items out of more than $100 million.Between 2013 and 2018, Johnny Grobman, 48, Raoul Doekhie, 53, and Sherida Nabi, 57, secured deep price discounts for infant formula and other items by lying to the U.S. manufacturers of the products. Doekhie and Nabi (who are married) told the manufacturers that they were purchasing the products to ship overseas, to Suriname, often in connection with purported government procurement contracts they held in Suriname.  In fact, the defendants did not have government procurement contracts and never intended to export the products to Suriname.  Instead, Grobman and others sold the products in the United States for millions of dollars, which the three defendants later split among themselves.The defendants hid their activity from the U.S. manufacturers of the FDA-regulated products in one of three ways.  The first was to send “dummy” shipments abroad. The dummy shipments did not contain the products purchased from the manufacturers, but they did generate documentation to prove that an export occurred.  The second method was to “U-turn” the products: The products were shipped abroad, generating export documentation.  As soon as they arrived overseas, they were shipped back to the United States.  The third method was to create fraudulent export shipping documentation showing that the products were exported when they actually never left the country.Following a 13-day trial, on February 6, 2020, a federal jury found Grobman, Doekhie, and Nabi guilty of conspiring to commit wire fraud; wire fraud; money laundering; conspiring to obtain pre-retail medical products worth $5,000 or more by fraud or deception, theft of pre-retail medical products; and smuggling goods from the United States.On April 25, 2022, the Court entered forfeiture money judgments for the amounts of the criminal proceeds traceable to the offenses of conviction as follows: $87,187,374.83 against Grobman and $115,699,273.61 jointly against the Defendants Doekhie and Nabi.Juan Antonio Gonzalez, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and Justin C. Fielder, Special Agent in Charge, Miami Field Office, United States Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI), announced the sentences that U.S. District Judge Roy K. Altman imposed yesterday.“The fraud perpetrated by these defendants is nothing short of egregious,” said U.S. Attorney Gonzalez. “The 18-year prison sentences reflect the seriousness of the defendants’ crimes.  Our Office will continue to vigorously prosecute those who commit these types of offenses.”“Today’s announcement should serve as a reminder that those who fraudulently divert consumer products for profit will be held accountable for their actions,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin C. Fielder, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Miami Field Office.  “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who engage in fraudulent schemes involving FDA-regulated products.”FDA-OCI investigated the case.  Broward County Sherriff’s Office assisted.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Shannon Shaw, Christopher Browne, and John Shipley prosecuted the case.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Joshua Paster is handling asset forfeiture.This case is the second large-scale prosecution by the South Florida U.S. Attorney’s Office and FDA-OCI targeting fraud schemes related to the so-called “gray market,” which involves the diversion and re-sale of certain goods that were not intended for distribution in the United States.  In September 2019, the Office announced the convictions of five defendants, including Byramji Javat, a citizen of Pakistan and Chairman of the Dubai-based Uniworld Group, for various offenses relating to a global fraud scheme that relied upon false claims about the United States military and the Government of Afghanistan.Related court documents and information may be found on the website of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida at www.flsd.uscourts.gov or at http://pacer.flsd.uscourts.gov, under case number 18-cr-20989.###Topic(s):Consumer ProtectionFinancial FraudComponent(s):USAO - Florida, SouthernContact:Marlene Rodriguez Special Counsel to the U.S. Attorney Public Affairs Officer USAFLS.News@usdoj.gov"

Pursuant to his plea agreement, Kothuru was required to pay $500,000 prior to his sentencing to be credited toward the court-ordered forfeiture and restitution.According to court documents, Kothuru was the majority owner of Laboratory Services of America, LLC (LSA), a Las Vegas-based lab that provided drug testing on urine samples. After performing that testing, ATL routinely sent tested samples to other laboratories for “confirmation” testing.One of those other labs included American Toxicology Labs (ATL), formerly owned by Michael Norman Dube, who also owned a chain of clinics in Tennessee and Virginia that purported to treat opioid addiction with buprenorphine. Providers at those clinics frequently ordered urine drug screens for their patients in order to assess current drug use and to gather medically necessary information that would be pertinent to treatment.In January 2015, Kothuru and Dube entered into an arrangement in which Dube would refer all of ATL’s tested urine samples to LSA for confirmation testing in exchange for cash kickback payments to Dube’s personal checking account.Between March 23, 2015, and September 20, 2016, Kothuru’s lab received more than $750,000 from Medicare, Virginia Medicaid, Kentucky Medicaid, and TennCare in compensation for confirmation testing performed on samples directly related to services illegally billed and collected in accordance with the kickback scheme between Kothuru and Dube.As part of a previous guilty plea in 2011 to intentionally omitting information from reports as required under the Controlled Substances Act, Dube had been prohibited by the Department of Health and Human Services from ever participating in any federal health care program again.  As part of his involvement in the kickback scheme with Kothuru, Dube pleaded guilty in March 2021 to two counts of health care fraud, sentenced to 36 months in federal prison, and ordered to pay over $9,000,000 in fines, forfeitures, and restitution costs.United States Attorney Christopher R.

Tricare and CHAMPVA are the health care benefit programs for the United States Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs.In connection with pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy, Alisa Catoggio, 40, of Boca Raton, Florida, admitted that she was involved in a scheme that paid approximately $40 million in kickbacks to patient recruiters in exchange for their referring prescriptions issued to Tricare and CHAMPVA beneficiaries to a Broward compounding pharmacy.  The prescriptions were for expensive pain creams, scar creams, vitamins, and other medically unnecessary compound drugs, which were reimbursed at amounts of up to $15,000 for a one month’s supply.  In addition, the Broward pharmacy did not charge the beneficiaries the mandatory co-payments for the drugs, which constituted another form of illicit kickback.  The co-conspirators used phony charities to conceal this “no-copayment” kickback activity.  The fraudulent billings caused a loss to the military health care program of approximately $88 million.Sentencing is scheduled for August 9, at 2:00 p.m., before U.S. District Judge Roy K. Altman. Catoggio faces up to 5 years in federal prison.U.S. Attorney Juan Antonio Gonzalez of the Southern District of Florida; Special Agent in Charge Cynthia A.

        "content": "Department of JusticeEastern District of TennesseeFORIMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, May 18, 2022GREENEVILLE, Tenn. A federal judge in Greeneville, Tennessee, sentenced two Florida men for their roles in a multimillion-dollar health care fraud scheme.Peter Bolos, 44, of Tampa, was convicted by a federal jury in December 2021 of conspiracy to commit health care fraud, 22 counts of mail fraud and introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce.  U.S. District Judge J. Ronnie Greer sentenced Bolos to 14 years in prison and ordered him to pay more than $24.6 million in restitution and $2.5 million in forfeiture.  The court also sentenced Bolos’s co-defendant, Michael Palso, 48, of Tampa, to 33 months in prison and ordered him to pay more than $24.6 million in restitution.  Palso previously pleaded guilty to his role in the conspiracy, as did 14 other defendants in related cases.  The remaining defendants are scheduled to be sentenced later this week.According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Bolos, Palso and their co-conspirators, Andrew Assad, Scott Roix, Larry Smith, Mihir Taneja, Arun Kapoor, and Maikel Bolos, as well as various other companies owned or controlled by some of these individuals, deceived pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), such as Express Scripts and CVS Caremark, regarding tens of thousands of prescriptions.  The PBMs processed and approved claims for prescription drugs on behalf of insurance companies. Bolos and his co-conspirators defrauded the PBMs into authorizing millions of dollars’ worth of claims that private insurers such as Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee, and public insurers such as Medicaid and TRICARE, paid to pharmacies controlled by the co-conspirators.“The significant sentences imposed by the court are a reflection of the gravity of the crimes that the defendants in this case committed,” said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Arun G. Rao, head of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch.  “The department will continue to work with law enforcement partners to prosecute those who take advantage of telemedicine to perpetrate fraud schemes.”“The scale of the prescription-drug fraud scheme orchestrated by these defendants and their conspirators was astonishing, and the Court’s prison sentences reflect the seriousness of their crimes,” said U.S. Attorney Francis M. Hamilton III for the Eastern District of Tennessee.  “The financial harm caused by health care fraud hurts all Americans, and the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Tennessee will continue to support the cooperation among its federal law enforcement partners that is necessary to bring criminal swindlers like these defendants to justice.”“This sentencing is the result of a multi-agency investigation into a complex telemedicine pharmacy fraud scheme, requiring substantial investigative resources,” said Special Agent in Charge Joseph E. Carrico of the FBI’s Knoxville Field Office.  “The FBI, with its law enforcement partners, will remain vigilant to assure that unscrupulous individuals who exploit our health care system are brought to justice.”“Distributing misbranded prescription drugs in the U.S. marketplace places patients’ health at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin C. Fielder of the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI) Miami Field Office.  “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who put profits ahead of public health.”“Bolos and his co-conspirators abandoned their responsibilities in the health care industry through an elaborate fraud scheme and manipulated the system without regard for patient need or medical necessity to line their pockets,” said Special Agent in Charge John Condon of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Tampa.  “This significant sentence should serve as a warning to anyone who attempts to deceive the government and steal from taxpayers.”“Providers who solicit beneficiaries’ personal information and use it to defraud federal health care programs not only undermine the integrity of those programs; they also divert valuable taxpayer dollars for self-serving purposes,” said Special Agent in Charge Tamala E. Miles of the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG).  “HHS-OIG is proud to work alongside our law enforcement partners to investigate and hold accountable perpetrators of federal health care fraud.”“The U.S. Postal Service, Office of Inspector General, will continue to vigorously investigate those who commit frauds against federal benefit programs and the U.S. Postal Service,” said Special Agent in Charge Matthew Modafferi of the U.S. Postal Service, Office of Inspector General Northeast Area Field Office.  “The sentencing in this case sends a clear message to pharmaceutical companies that tactics like these will not be tolerated.  The U.S. Postal Service, Office of Inspector General would like to thank our law enforcement partners and the Department of Justice for their dedication and efforts in this investigation.”Court documents and evidence at trial established that Bolos, Assad and Palso owned and operated Synergy Pharmacy in Palm Harbor, Florida.  Under their direction, Synergy employed Scott Roix, a Florida telemarketer operating under the name HealthRight, to generate prescriptions for Synergy and the other pharmacies involved in the scheme. The Prescriptions were typically for drugs such as pain creams, scar creams and vitamins.  To obtain the prescriptions, Roix used HeathRight’s telemarketing platform as a telemedicine service, cold-calling consumers and deceiving them into agreeing to accept the drugs and to provide their personal insurance information.  HeathRight then paid doctors to authorize the prescriptions through its telemedicine platform, even though the doctors never communicated directly with the patients and relied solely on the telemarketers’ screening process as the basis for their authorizations.  Because this faulty and fraudulent process made the prescriptions invalid, the drugs were misbranded under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.  Synergy and the other pharmacies nonetheless dispensed the drugs to consumers as part of the scheme, so that Bolos could submit fraudulent reimbursement claims.Court documents and evidence at trial established that during the conspiracy, which lasted from May 2015 through April 2018, Bolos and Palso, along with co-defendant Andrew Assad, paid Roix millions of dollars to buy at least 60,000 invalid prescriptions generated by HealthRight.  Bolos selected specific medications for the prescriptions that he could submit for profitable reimbursements at inflated prices.  In addition, Bolos, Palso, and Assad used illegal means to hide his activity from the PBMs so that they could remain undetected.The sentencing for the remaining defendants – all of whom pleaded guilty prior to trial – are scheduled to occur later this week.  Larry Smith, Alpha-Omega Pharmacy, Germaine Pharmacy, Zoetic Pharmacy, Tanith Enterprises LLC, ULD Wholesale Group, and Taneja will be sentenced on May 17.  Kapoor, Sterling Knight Pharmaceuticals and Maikel Bolos will be sentenced on May 18.  Assad, Roix and HeathRight LLC will be sentenced on May 19.  All of the sentencings will occur before Judge Greer in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee at Greeneville.The trial verdict and plea agreements resulted from a multi-year investigation conducted by the HHS-OIG (Nashville); FDA-OCI (Nashville); U.S. Postal Service, Office of Inspector General (Buffalo); FBI (Knoxville and Johnson City, Tennessee); OPM-OIG (Atlanta); and HSI (Tampa). The U.S. Marshals Service also assisted in the investigation and the forfeiture of assets.Assistant U.S. Attorney Mac Heavener of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Tennessee and Senior Trial Attorney David Gunn of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch in Washington are prosecuting the case.  They were assisted by Barbra Pemberton, Bryan Brandenburg, and April Denard from the U.S. Attorney’s Office.###Topic(s):Prescription DrugsFinancial FraudComponent(s):USAO - Tennessee, EasternContact:Rachelle Barnes Public Affairs Officer (865) 545-4167"

Driscoll, Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), and Thomas Walsh, Rockland County District Attorney, announced that GABRIEL LETIZIA, Jr., was sentenced in White Plains federal court to 60 months in prison for defrauding customers of his consumer products testing company and causing misbranded drugs to be introduced into interstate commerce.  United States District Judge Kenneth M. Karas imposed today’s sentence. LETIZIA previously pled guilty before United States Magistrate Judge Paul E. Davison.U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “For three decades, Gabriel Letizia defrauded AMA’s customers and jeopardized the safety of millions of consumers, all in the name of greed. Thanks to our partners at FDA-OCI, the FBI, and the Rockland County District Attorney’s Office, he has now been sentenced to prison.”According to the allegations in the Indictment, the Superseding Information to which LETIZIA pled guilty, court filings, and statements made in court:LETIZIA was the owner and executive director of AMA Laboratories, Inc. (“AMA”), a consumer product testing company in Rockland County, New York. LETIZIA began operating AMA in the early 1980s, and became its sole owner in approximately 2003.AMA purported to test the safety and efficacy of cosmetics, sunscreens, and other products on specified numbers of volunteer panelists for consumer products companies. Clients of AMA used the test results to support their claims that their products were safe, effective, hypoallergenic, or provided a certain Sun Protection Factor (“SPF”), including after exposure to water. AMA clients that manufactured sunscreens used the test results to comply with FDA regulations requiring sunscreen manufacturers to have their products tested and to maintain the test results for possible review by the FDA.From 1987 through April 2017, LETIZIA and AMA personnel operating at his direction defrauded AMA’s customers of more than $46 million by testing products on materially lower numbers of panelists than the numbers specified and paid for by AMA’s customers. According to AMA employees, the majority of AMA’s tests contained fraudulent results, for two reasons. First, at LETIZIA’s instruction, AMA personnel rarely tested products on the number of panelists requested by AMA’s clients. Instead, AMA tested products on a far lower number of panelists, typically 20 or less, rather than the 50 for which the clients had paid. AMA’s fees for tests were based, in part, on the number of panelists that were to participate in the study. At LETIZIA’s direction, AMA sent its clients fraudulent test results in which AMA personnel included fictitious data for “phantom” panelists who had not actually participated in the tests.Second, at LETIZIA’s direction, AMA personnel routinely falsified test results relating to its clients’ products, which included suppressing adverse reactions and deviating from testing protocols. From 2012 through April 2017, AMA received $46.2 million in revenue from the fraudulent reports.*                *                *In addition to his prison term, LETIZIA, 72, of New City, New York, was sentenced to three years of supervised release, restitution in the amount of $1,440,238, and forfeiture in the amount of $46,200,000.Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Rockland County District Attorney’s Office.The case is being prosecuted by the Office’s White Plains Division.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jeffrey C. Coffman, James McMahon, and Olga I.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeWestern District of MichiganFORIMMEDIATE RELEASETuesday, May 17, 2022GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN– The United States has filed a lawsuit against The Prometheus Group (Prometheus), a New Hampshire manufacturer of pelvic muscle therapeutic systems and related rectal probes, and Richard Poore, its president and sole owner. The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan, alleges that the defendants violated the False Claims Act by causing health care providers to bill Medicare for services in which the providers improperly re-used single-user rectal sensors and single-use catheters on multiple patients. The United States alleges that the reuse of these devices on multiple patients unnecessarily exposed vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries to the risks of serious bacterial, fungal and viral infections.“Providers and suppliers who participate in federal health care programs are expected to maintain the highest standards of patient care,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The department will hold parties accountable for causing the use of unsafe procedures that may put patients’ health at risk.”“The Medicare Program is designed to serve an already-vulnerable population,” said Mark Totten, United States Attorney for the Western District of Michigan. “Device manufacturers must not train providers who bill Medicare for services to use devices in a way that fails to protect patient health.”“By encouraging the improper reuse of medical devices for financial gain, this manufacturer significantly endangered the health and safety of patients,” said Special Agent in Charge Mario Pinto with the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “HHS-OIG is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to hold accountable any medical device manufacturers who exploit Federal health care programs and threaten the health and safety of beneficiaries.”Prometheus manufactures and sells device systems for use in pelvic muscle rehabilitation (PMR), a non-surgical therapy to eliminate or reduce symptoms of pelvic floor disorders, including urinary and fecal incontinence. Specifically, Prometheus has manufactured and marketed the Pathway CTS 2000 Pelvic Floor Training System and the Morpheus System. Both systems required the use of a rectal pressure probe that is inserted into a patient’s rectum during therapy. Prometheus manufactured its own sensor for use with the Pathway System and encouraged its customers to use another company’s anorectal manometry catheter with the Morpheus System.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared the Prometheus rectal pressure sensor to be used as a single-user device and the anorectal manometry catheter to be used as a single-use device. For example, the instructions for use identify the rectal pressure sensor as “a potential bio-hazard” and state: “This sensor is restricted for single person use only. Use by another person is strictly prohibited by Federal Regulations.” Similarly, the anorectal manometry catheter was cleared by the FDA as a disposable single-use device, with packaging that states: “Do not re-use.”According to the United States’ complaint, the defendants knew of these restrictions, but for years encouraged and instructed health care providers to reuse the rectal pressure sensors and anorectal manometry catheters on multiple patients, using a glove or condom to cover the probes, as a way to reduce the overhead costs associated with Prometheus’s systems. This reuse, which exposed patients to unnecessary risk of infections, was not reasonable or necessary, and thus was ineligible for Medicare coverage. In addition to the safety risks, Prometheus allegedly made no attempt to determine if the probes worked effectively when re-used under those conditions.The lawsuit is captioned United States v. The Prometheus Group., et al., No. 1:22-CV-446 (W.D. Mich.) and is being handled by the Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch (Fraud Section) and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Michigan. Lead counsel are Senior Trial Counsel Jay D. Majors and Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Hull. Investigative support is being provided by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, the FDA, and the FBI.The claims asserted in the United States’ complaint are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability.Topic(s):Consumer ProtectionComponent(s):USAO - Michigan, Western"

Sellinger announced.Jon Paul Dadaian, 53, of New York, a board-certified anesthesiologist and pain management specialist, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Susan D. Wigenton to an information charging him with unlawfully selling prescription cancer medication, which had been previously purchased using his medical license and under the representation that such medication was to be used to treat his patients.According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:While operating his medical practice in Elmwood, New Jersey, Dadaian befriended two individuals who owned and operated two businesses that were wholesale distributors of prescription drugs. At the request of these individuals, and in return for approximately $130,500 in payments, Dadaian used his medical license – and allowed others to use it – to purchase expensive prescription drugs, primarily, cold-chain biologic infusion medications that typically are used to treat cancers, macular degeneration, and autoimmune diseases. By recruiting and using Dadaian and his medical license to purchase the drugs, the two individuals were able to obtain prescription drugs from the pharmaceutical manufacturers’ authorized distributors that they would not otherwise have been permitted to purchase. They were then able to sell them at a profit through their two businesses. By using Dadaian and his medical license to purchase their prescription drugs, these two individuals also obtained discounted community physician pricing for the prescription drugs with respect to some of the drug purchases. The discounted community physician pricing was based upon specialized discounts that the pharmaceutical manufacturers only offered to treating physicians and others similarly situated. The two individuals and their businesses would not have been qualified to receive this favorable pricing if they had attempted to purchase the prescription drugs directly from the pharmaceutical manufacturers.In purchasing the drugs, Dadaian and the two individuals made numerous false and misleading representations to the pharmaceutical manufacturers and authorized distributors, including that Dadaian purchased the drugs to use to treat his patients, and that the drugs would not be resold or redistributed. In actuality, none of the drugs were administered to Dadaian’s patients, but were ultimately sold to customers of the two businesses for a profit. The scheme ran from June 2012 through April 2018, during which tens of millions in prescription drugs were purchased in Dadaian’s name and using his medical license.The sale of prescription drugs purchased by a healthcare entity is punishable by a maximum of three years in prison and a $10,000 fine. In his plea agreement, Dadaian also agreed to make restitution for the full amount of any loss resulting from his offense. Sentencing for Dadaian is scheduled for Sept. 20, 2022.U.S. Attorney Sellinger credited special agents of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations New York Field Office, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Brian G. McClune; and special agents of U.S. Attorney’s Office, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Thomas Mahoney, with the investigation leading to today’s guilty plea.The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Diana Vondra Carrig and Sara Aliya Aliabadi of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Camden.Attachment(s):Download Dadaian.Information.pdfTopic(s):Prescription DrugsComponent(s):USAO - New JerseyPress Release Number:22-184"

Grasso et al., 20 Cr. 163 (OKC).  Both GRASSO and BANCA pled guilty before U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel. GRASSO and BANCA will each be sentenced by Judge Castel on September 6, 2022.U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Grasso and Banca represent the corruption and greed of those in the racehorse industry looking to win at any cost.  In peddling illegal drugs and selling prescriptions to corrupt trainers, Louis Grasso abdicated his responsibilities as a medical professional to ensure the safety and health of the racehorses he “treated.” By injecting horses with unnecessary and, at times, unknown drugs, Grasso risked the lives and welfare of the animals under his care, all in service of helping corrupt racehorse trainers like Banca line their pockets through fraud. These latest convictions demonstrate the commitment of this Office and of our partners at the FBI to hold accountable individuals seeking to profit from animal abuse and deceit.”According to the allegations contained in the Superseding Indictment, the Superseding Information charging GRASSO and BANCA, prior charging instruments and other filings in this case[1], and statements during court proceedings:The charges in the GRASSO case arise from an investigation of widespread schemes by racehorse trainers, veterinarians, PED distributors, and others to manufacture, distribute, and receive adulterated and misbranded PEDs and to secretly administer those PEDs to racehorses competing at all levels of professional horseracing. By evading PED prohibitions and deceiving regulators and horse racing officials, participants in these schemes sought to improve race performance and obtain prize money from racetracks throughout the United States, all to the detriment and risk of the health and well-being of the racehorses.  GRASSO, a veterinarian, not only accepted payment in exchange for prescriptions for powerful and medically unnecessary performance-enhancing drugs, he also created, distributed, and administered custom-made performance-enhancing drugs that were all misbranded and adulterated substances designed solely to improve racehorse performance. Through this fraudulent scheme, GRASSO helped corrupt trainers collect over $47 million in ill-gotten purse winnings. As a racehorse trainer, BANCA purchased and administered adulterated and misbranded drugs to his racehorses, and as a result of his crimes, his horses earned over $16 million in purse winnings. BANCA stood to profit from the success of racehorses under his control by earning a share of his horses’ winnings, and by improving his horses’ racing records, thereby yielding higher trainer fees and increasing the number of racehorses under his control.*                 *                 *U.S. Attorney Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI New York Office’s Eurasian Organized Crime Task Force and its support of the Bureau’s Integrity in Sports and Gaming Initiative.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of VermontFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, April 29, 2022The United States Attorney’s Office announced that Ariel Quiros, 65, of Puerto Rico, and formerly of Key Biscayne, Florida, was sentenced today to 60 months in prison by Chief Judge Geoffrey W. Crawford in United States District Court in connection with his involvement in the AnC Vermont EB-5 investment project.  Chief Judge Crawford also ordered Quiros to serve a three-year term of supervised release and to pay $8,338,600.77 in restitution. Today’s sentencing follows Quiros’s guilty pleas in August 2020 to three felony charges: conspiring with co-defendants William Kelly, Jong Weon (Alex) Choi, and William Stenger in a multi-year wire fraud scheme to defraud immigrant investors seeking green cards through the EB-5 program; money laundering for using a loan collateralized with investor funds to pay a personal tax obligation; and concealing material facts in a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency, namely United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which oversaw the EB-5 process.According to court records and proceedings, the AnC Vermont project was designed to raise $110 million from 220 immigrant investors in order to construct and operate a biotechnology facility in Newport, Vermont.  From 2012 to 2016, the defendants convinced approximately 169 investors to invest approximately $85 million in the AnC Vermont project, in addition to paying approximately $8 million in “administrative fees.” The facility was never constructed. As Chief Judge Crawford observed during Stenger’s sentencing hearing, in reality the AnC Vermont project was a “ghost.”When Quiros pleaded guilty, he admitted that he and his co-conspirators misled AnC investors about important information, including how investor money would be used, the timing of job creation for the project, and Choi’s role in the project. For example, Quiros knew that investors were given a use-of-funds chart that contained a number of misrepresentations about the amount of funds Quiros and Choi planned to receive. Moreover, as the defendants raised investor money, Quiros used investor funds for purposes unrelated to the project, and he participated in concealing this misuse of funds. Quiros further admitted that the scheme included misrepresentations about the timing of the jobs that would be created by the project and the business revenue that would be generated from the project.In addition to the wire fraud conspiracy charges, Quiros admitted using AnC investor funds for personal expenses, specifically a $6 million payment to the IRS in early 2015 funded by a loan collateralized by investor funds. Quiros also admitted helping to conceal from the Vermont Regional Center that Choi, who was deeply involved in the project, was being investigated in Korea for financial crimes.As part of his plea agreement, Quiros agreed to cooperate in the government’s ongoing matters related to this case. The plea agreement signed by Quiros and the government capped Quiros’s potential jail sentence at 97 months, so long as he abided by the terms of the agreement. In connection with Quiros’s sentencing proceeding, the government informed the Court that Quiros should receive significant credit for his cooperation and would be an important witness at any trial of his co-defendants.Quiros’s sentencing concludes the criminal proceedings for all three of the defendants who have appeared in this matter.  Co-defendants Stenger and Kelly were each sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment by Chief Judge Crawford earlier this month.  Co-defendant Choi remains at large.U.S. Attorney Nikolas P. Kerest expressed his continued gratitude for the outstanding investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, IRS Criminal Investigation, and the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations in this case. U.S. Attorney Kerest also thanked the Justice Department’s Fraud Section and the Office of International Affairs for their invaluable collaboration in this prosecution.“The Jay Peak EB-5 fraud was massive, lengthy, and wide-ranging.  The defendants’ scheme impacted the lives of many hundreds of individuals, including not only investors from all over the world who dreamed of one day becoming United States citizens, but also Vermonters in Northeast Kingdom communities who hoped for the economic development and new jobs that the defendants promised to deliver,” said U.S. Attorney Kerest.  “The conclusion of the criminal cases against Ariel Quiros, William Kelly, and William Stenger demonstrates that the U.S. Attorney’s Office is committed to addressing the most challenging cases and to rooting out fraud in all corners of Vermont.   I commend our prosecutors and law enforcement partners for their dogged investigation and prosecution of this complex matter.”\"Ariel Quiros, William Kelly, and William Stenger knowingly took advantage of innocent EB-5 investors,\" said Janeen DiGuiseppi, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Albany Division. \"Their deceptive scheme destroyed their plans and ruined the promise of economic development in the city of Newport and the Northeast Kingdom. This sentence should send a message that the FBI takes our responsibility to investigate and pursue those who commit fraud for personal gain very seriously. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to hold accountable those who use illegal means to take advantage of others.\"“EB-5 investors contribute significant resources to American businesses and the U.S. economy with the aim of preserving jobs and seeking a pathway for obtaining lawful permanent residency,” said Joleen D. Simpson, Special Agent in Charge, IRS Criminal Investigation, Boston Field Office. “IRS Criminal Investigation is proud to bring our forensic accounting expertise in this multiagency effort to help ensure the integrity of this program and bring to justice those seeking to defraud it.”“The U.S. public relies on FDA oversight to ensure that their medical products are safe and effective,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Ronne G. Malham, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations New York Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice companies that attempt to subvert the regulatory functions of the FDA, which are intended to protect the public health. We commend the efforts of the Department of Justice for their vigorous pursuit of justice in this matter.”The prosecutors handling the case are Assistant U.S. Attorneys Paul Van de Graaf and Nicole Cate.  Ariel Quiros is represented by Neil Taylor, Esq. and Robert Katims, Esq.  William Kelly was represented by Robert Goldstein, Esq. and Mary Kehoe, Esq.  William Stenger was represented by Brooks McArthur, Esq. and David Williams, Esq.Topic(s):Financial FraudImmigrationComponent(s):USAO - Vermont"

Lee billed these unnecessary procedures to Medicare using an inappropriate code in order to obtain a higher reimbursement, a practice known as “upcoding.” In addition, the evidence showed that Lee re-packaged used, contaminated catheters for re-use on patients. These catheters had been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing as single-use only and the re-use of these devices put patients at risk of infection and other bodily injury. Lee submitted claims of approximately $12 million to Medicare for the vein ablation procedures he performed and received $4.5 million as a result.In October 2019, Lee was convicted after a five-day trial, when a jury found him guilty of seven counts of health care fraud and one count of adulteration of a medical device. Lee also pleaded guilty on March 2, 2020, to one count of submitting false declarations in a bankruptcy proceeding. In addition to the term of imprisonment, Lee was sentenced to serve three years of supervised release and ordered to pay more than $4.5 million in restitution to Medicare.Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A.

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, April 20,2022Criminal Charges Brought Against Owners and Executives of Medical Businesses, Physicians, Marketers, and Manufacturers of Fake COVID-19 Vaccination Record Cards with Losses Exceeding $149 MillionThe Department of Justice today announced criminal charges against 21 defendants in nine federal districts across the United States for their alleged participation in various health care related fraud schemes that exploited the COVID-19 pandemic. These cases allegedly resulted in over $149 million in COVID-19-related false billings to federal programs and theft from federally-funded pandemic assistance programs. In connection with the enforcement action, the department seized over $8 million in cash and other fraud proceeds.“The Department of Justice’s Health Care Fraud Unit and our partners are dedicated to rooting out schemes that have exploited the pandemic,” said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Today’s enforcement action reinforces our commitment to using all available tools to hold accountable medical professionals, corporate executives, and others who have placed greed above care during an unprecedented public health emergency.”“This COVID-19 health care fraud enforcement action involves extraordinary efforts to prosecute some of the largest and most wide-ranging pandemic frauds detected to date,” said Director for COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Kevin Chambers. “The scale and complexity of the schemes prosecuted today illustrates the success of our unprecedented interagency effort to quickly investigate and prosecute those who abuse our critical health care programs.”This announcement builds on the success of the May 2021 COVID-19 Enforcement Action and involves the prosecution of various COVID-19 health care fraud schemes. For example, several cases announced today involve defendants who allegedly offered COVID-19 testing to induce patients to provide their personal identifying information and a saliva or blood sample. The defendants are alleged to have then used the information and samples to submit false and fraudulent claims to Medicare for unrelated, medically unnecessary, and far more expensive tests or services. In one such scheme in the Central District of California, two owners of a clinical laboratory were charged with a health care fraud, kickback, and money laundering scheme that involved the fraudulent billing of over $214 million for laboratory tests, over $125 million of which allegedly involved fraudulent claims during the pandemic for COVID-19 and respiratory pathogen tests. In two separate cases in the District of Maryland and the Eastern District of New York, owners of medical clinics allegedly obtained confidential information from patients seeking COVID-19 testing at drive-thru testing sites and then submitted fraudulent claims for lengthy office visits with the patients that did not, in fact, occur. The proceeds of these fraudulent schemes were allegedly laundered through shell corporations in the United States, transferred to foreign countries, and used to purchase real estate and luxury items.“Throughout the pandemic, we have seen trusted medical professionals orchestrate and carry out egregious crimes against their patients all for financial gain,” said Assistant Director Luis Quesada of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division. “These health care fraud abuses erode the integrity and trust patients have with those in the health care industry, particularly during a vulnerable and worrisome time for many individuals. The actions of these criminals are unacceptable, and the FBI, working in coordination with our law enforcement partners, will continue to investigate and pursue those who exploit the integrity of the health care industry for profit.”In another type of COVID-19 health care fraud scheme announced today, defendants allegedly exploited policies that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) put in place to enable increased access to care during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in the Southern District of Florida, one medical professional was charged with a health care fraud, wire fraud, and kickback scheme that allegedly involved billing for sham telemedicine encounters that did not occur and agreeing to order unnecessary genetic testing in exchange for access to telehealth patients. Late last year, one defendant previously was sentenced to 82 months in prison in connection with this scheme.“The attempt to profit from the COVID-19 pandemic by targeting beneficiaries and stealing from federal health care programs is unconscionable,” said Inspector General Christi A. Grimm of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). “HHS-OIG is proud to work alongside our law enforcement partners at the federal and state levels to ensure that bad actors who perpetrate egregious and harmful crimes are held accountable.”Today’s announcement includes charges against two additional defendants for schemes targeting the Provider Relief Fund (PRF). The PRF is part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, a federal law enacted in March 2020 that provided financial assistance to medical providers to provide needed medical care to Americans suffering from COVID-19. In total, 10 defendants have been charged with crimes related to misappropriating PRF monies intended for frontline medical providers and three have pleaded guilty.Today’s announcement also includes charges against manufacturers and distributors of fake COVID-19 vaccination record cards who, according to the allegations, intentionally sought to obstruct the HHS and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in their efforts to administer the nationwide vaccination program and provide Americans with accurate proof of vaccination. For example, in the Northern District of California, three additional defendants were charged in a scheme to sell homeoprophylaxis immunizations for COVID-19 and falsify COVID-19 vaccination record cards to make it appear that customers received government-authorized vaccines. One defendant allegedly misused her position as the Director of Pharmacy at a northern California hospital to obtain real lot numbers for the Moderna vaccine that were then used to falsify COVID-19 vaccination record cards. Another defendant pleaded guilty in April 2022. In a separate case in the Western District of Washington, one manufacturer was charged in the multistate distribution of fake COVID-19 vaccination record cards after allegedly telling an undercover federal agent that “until I get caught and go to jail, [expletive] it I’m taking the money, ha! I don’t care.”Additionally, the Center for Program Integrity, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CPI/CMS) separately announced today that it has taken an additional 28 administrative actions against providers for their alleged involvement in fraud, waste, and abuse schemes related to the delivery of care for COVID-19, as well as schemes that capitalize upon the public health emergency.“We are committed to working closely with our law enforcement partners to combat fraud, waste and abuse in our federal health care programs,” said CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure. “The administrative actions CMS has taken protect the Medicare Trust Funds while also safeguarding people enrolled in Medicare.”Today’s enforcement actions were led and coordinated by Assistant Chief Jacob Foster and Trial Attorney D. Keith Clouser of the National Rapid Response Strike Force, and Assistant Chief Justin Woodard of the Health Care Fraud Unit’s Gulf Coast Strike Force in the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section. The Fraud Section’s National Rapid Response Strike Force and the Health Care Fraud Unit’s Strike Forces (SF) in Brooklyn, the Gulf Coast, Miami, Los Angeles, and Newark, as well as the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices for the District of Maryland, District of New Jersey, District of Utah, Northern District of California, and Western District of Tennessee are prosecuting these cases. Descriptions of each case involved in today’s enforcement action are available on the department’s website at: https://www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/health-care-fraud-unit/case-summaries.In addition to the FBI, HHS-OIG, and CPI/CMS, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service; U.S. Postal Service Office of the Inspector General; Department of Defense Office of Inspector General; Department of the Interior Office of the Inspector General; Department of Labor Office of the Inspector General; Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations; Homeland Security Investigations; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Office of the Inspector General; and other federal and local law enforcement agencies participated in the law enforcement action.The Fraud Section leads the Health Care Fraud Strike Force. Since its inception in March 2007, the Health Care Fraud Strike Force, which maintains 15 strike forces operating in 24 federal districts, has charged more than 4,200 defendants who have collectively billed the Medicare program for nearly $19 billion. In addition, the CMS, working in conjunction with the HHS-OIG, are taking steps to increase accountability and decrease the presence of fraudulent providers.On May 17, 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The Task Force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts. For more information on the department’s response to the pandemic, please visit https://www.justice.gov/coronavirus.The Department of Justice needs the public’s assistance in remaining vigilant and reporting suspected fraudulent activity. To report suspected fraud, contact the National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF) at (866) 720-5721 or file an online complaint at: https://www.justice.gov/disaster-fraud/webform/ncdf-disaster-complaint-form.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of VermontFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, April 14, 2022The United States Attorney’s Office announced that William Stenger, 73, of Newport, Vermont, was sentenced today to 18 months in prison by Chief Judge Geoffrey W. Crawford in United States District Court.  Chief Judge Crawford also ordered a 3-year term of supervised release and ordered Stenger to pay $250,000 in restitution. Today’s sentencing follows Stenger’s August 2021 guilty plea to a felony count of knowingly and willfully submitting false documents to the Vermont Regional Center (“VRC”) in connection with his involvement in the Jay Peak Biomedical Research Park EB-5 investment project, also called the AnC Vermont project.According to court records and proceedings, the AnC Vermont project was designed to raise $110 million from 220 immigrant investors in order to construct and operate a biotechnology facility in Newport, Vermont.  EB-5 immigrant investors could qualify for permanent resident status (commonly known as a green card) by investing $500,000 in a commercial enterprise approved by the VRC, which had the authority to approve and monitor EB-5 projects in Vermont, and by USCIS.  In order to obtain a green card, each investor needed to demonstrate to USCIS that his or her investment had created, or would create within a few years, ten jobs.  So, for the AnC Vermont project, it was necessary for Stenger and his co-defendants to demonstrate a plan to create at least 2,200 jobs in a short timeframe in order to obtain USCIS approval.  From 2012 to 2016, approximately 169 investors invested approximately $85 million in the AnC Vermont project, in addition to paying approximately $8 million in “administrative fees.”  Fundraising was never completed, and the AnC Vermont facility was never constructed.Stenger pleaded guilty to submitting false documents to the VRC in January of 2015 as part of his effort to convince the VRC to allow him to continue marketing the AnC Vermont project.  As Stenger admitted during his change of plea hearing, due to VRC’s concerns about a number of aspects of the AnC project, Stenger had agreed with the VRC in late June 2014 to suspend offering and marketing of the project.  Stenger knew that he had to provide answers to questions from VRC about the project’s financial projections and about the status of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approvals needed for commercialization of the products in order to be permitted to market the project again.  Stenger’s January 2015 submission addressed, among other things, these topics.  Both the financial projections and the FDA timeline impacted whether the project would create the number of jobs needed for the investors to obtain immigration benefits.The AnC Vermont fraud involved two aspects: the defendants’ misrepresentations about job creation and future revenues, and the defendants’ misuse of investor funds.  Stenger’s guilty plea centered on the misrepresentation aspect of the fraud.  In connection with his sentencing, Stenger agreed not to dispute a broader set of facts asserted by the government in a sentencing-related brief, including that he participated in the misuse of investor funds along with co-defendants Ariel Quiros and William Kelly.  Their misuse of funds was principally caused by debts and cost overruns on earlier EB-5 projects, for which Stenger bore significant responsibility.  Stenger was the general partner for the EB-5 projects and assumed responsibility for how investors’ funds were used.  While Stenger was not principally responsible for executing the misuse of investor funds, he knew about and assisted in it.  Stenger hid the projects’ financial problems from the VRC, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and investors, and he repeatedly abused his position of trust to assure regulators and investors that the projects were successful, and nothing was wrong.Co-defendant William Kelly pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy and concealment charges in July 2021.  His sentencing hearing is scheduled to occur before Chief Judge Crawford on April 20, 2022.  Co-defendant Ariel Quiros pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering, and concealment charges in August 2020.  His sentencing is scheduled to occur before Chief Judge Crawford on April 29, 2022.  Both Quiros and Kelly agreed to cooperate in the government’s ongoing matters.  Co-defendant Choi remains at large.Nikolas P. Kerest, United States Attorney, expresses his gratitude for the outstanding investigation assistance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, IRS Criminal Investigation, the Food and Drug Administration, and for the assistance of the Justice Department’s Fraud Section and Office of International Affairs.  The prosecutors handling the case are Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nicole Cate and Paul Van de Graaf.  William Stenger is represented by Brooks McArthur, Esq. and David Williams, Esq.  Ariel Quiros is represented by Neil Taylor, Esq. and Robert Katims, Esq.  William Kelly is represented by Robert Goldstein, Esq. and Mary Kehoe, Esq.Topic(s):Financial FraudImmigrationComponent(s):USAO - Vermont"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeMiddle District of FloridaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, April 13, 2022Jacksonville, Florida –United States Attorney Roger B. Handberg announces that Monique Elizabeth Carter (35, Middleburg) today pleaded guilty to tampering with a consumer product, specifically, injectable fentanyl.  Carter faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in federal prison. A sentencing date has not yet been set.According to the plea agreement, Carter, a registered nurse who previously was employed by a hospital in Jacksonville, worked in a neural intensive care unit (ICU) providing intensive and specialized care to ocritically ill patients with life-threatening neurological problems. Certain ICU patients were prescribed intravenous doses of fentanyl, which is synthetic opioid used as a pain medication and as anesthesia.After Carter’s shift on September 28, 2021, a hospital pharmacist examined the ICU wing’s inventory of fentanyl and found a fentanyl syringe missing a tamper-proof cap, but with some form of foreign adhesive remaining at the tip. A second fentanyl syringe had a cap that appeared to have been glued back onto the syringe.  After reviewing hospital records, a pharmacist supervisor noted a pattern of Carter checking out doses of fentanyl for patients, but then cancelling the transactions and checking syringes back into the hospital’s inventory. Records showed that Carter did so 24 times between August 29 and September 28, 2021. Carter was the only nurse on her ICU wing who persistently engaged in such conduct.The next day, when Carter arrived for work, hospital representatives interviewed her. Confronted with the pharmacists’ findings, Carter eventually admitted that – to obtain drugs for personal use at home – she had been removing injectable fentanyl from syringes, replacing the drug with saline, and then gluing the plastic tampering caps back onto the syringes with an adhesive that she obtained from the hospital. Carter admitted that she had been tampering with fentanyl syringes since the summer of 2021. Carter denied injecting fentanyl while on duty at the hospital, however, law enforcement later located needles, saline syringes, and adhesive in her bag.Carter, as a trained healthcare professional, knew that her activities likely resulted in critically ill patients receiving diluted fentanyl that was not safe and effective. Having been deprived of sterile, medically necessary medication, such patients were exposed to possible infection and endured unnecessary pain and suffering. In addition, Carter knew that the failure to anesthetize or control pain in ICU patients can result in increased risks of illness or death, stemming from, among other things, respiratory, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal complications.This case was investigated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations and the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office – Pharmaceutical Diversion and Designer Drug Unit attached to the North Florida High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. It is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Michael J. Coolican.###Component(s):USAO - Florida, Middle"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeNorthern District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, April 6, 2022SAN FRANCISCO – A California-licensed naturopathic doctor pleaded guilty today for scheming to sell homeoprophylaxis immunization pellets and for falsifying COVID-19 vaccination cards by making it appear that customers had received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized Moderna vaccine. The Hon. Charles R. Breyer, U.S. District Judge accepted the plea.“Juli Mazi has admitted that she engaged in a scheme to sell fake health care records to her customers,” said U.S. Attorney Stephanie M. Hinds. “Mazi made profits by selling false immunization cards she knew would be used to mislead schools into believing students had been immunized from childhood illnesses as required by law. Mazi also sold fake COVID-19 Vaccination Record Cards suggesting she administered the Moderna vaccine to her customers when, in fact, she had not. Mazi’s fake health care records scheme endangered the health and well-being of students and the general public at a time when confidence in our public health system is of critical importance.”“This doctor violated the public’s trust and reliance on health care professionals – during a time when integrity was needed most,” said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Instead of providing sage information and guidance, Mazi profited from peddling unapproved remedies, stirring up false fears, and generating fake proof of vaccinations. The Department of Justice and its law enforcement partners are committed to protecting the American people during this national emergency, including protecting trust in the medical developments allowing us to emerge from the pandemic.”According to court documents, in April 2021, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) received a complaint from a member of the public that Juli A. Mazi, 41, of Napa, was offering homeoprophylaxis immunization pellets which she claimed would provide lifelong protection from COVID-19. Mazi also provided fake CDC COVID-19 vaccination record cards with instructions on how to complete the cards to make them falsely appear to be records of the FDA-authorized Moderna vaccine. The investigation revealed that Mazi provided fake CDC COVID-19 vaccination cards for more than 200 individuals.According to court documents, Mazi also offered homeoprophylaxis immunization pellets in place of childhood vaccinations required for attendance at school. Mazi provided her patients with deceptive “immunization” cards which she knew would be submitted to schools, and which fraudulently indicated that authorized vaccines had been administered. The investigation revealed that Mazi provided these fake immunization cards to more than 100 individuals.“During a time when the public has been heavily reliant on our medical professionals for advice and guidance, Mazi has brazenly violated the trust of the public by instilling fear and spreading misinformation surrounding COVID-19 immunizations and treatments,” said FBI Assistant Director Luis Quesada of the Criminal Investigative Division. “There is no place for fraudulent activity, and the FBI will continue to investigate and pursue those who abuse their positions of authority to try and profit in this criminal manner.”“By falsifying vaccine cards, providers not only undermine important measures to address the ongoing public health emergency; they can also endanger the health of their patients and the public,” said Special Agent in Charge Steven Ryan of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “HHS-OIG is proud to work with our law enforcement partners to ensure that all health care providers who misuse their medical professional status for financial gain are held accountable.”“The FDA plays a critical role in protecting public health during the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to take swift action on fraudulent COVID-19 products, such as this unauthorized and unproven purported ‘immunization’,” said Special Agent in Charge Lisa L. Malinowski, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office. “We will continue to pursue, investigate and bring to justice those whose actions jeopardize the public health.”“The defendant spread inaccurate medical information about COVID-19 for personal gain, clearly taking advantage of a situation that had made our community vulnerable,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Tim Stone. “As the government worked to provide accurate and relevant information during the pandemic, Mazi took advantage of the situation and chose to line her own pockets with profits from fraudulent vaccine documents and medicine, abusing the trust placed in her as a medical professional. The FBI will not tolerate such an abuse of trust,” he said.On February 2, 2022, the Office of the United States Attorney filed an information charging Mazi with one count of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343, and one count of making false statements related to health care matters, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1035. Pursuant to today’s plea agreement, Mazi pleaded guilty to both counts.Judge Breyer scheduled Mazi’s sentencing for July 29, 2022. Mazi faces a maximum statutory prison sentence of 20 years for the wire fraud charge and 5 years for the false statements charge.  In addition, each charge carries a maximum $250,000 fine and 3 years of supervised release.  However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. § 3553.HHS-OIG’s San Francisco Regional Office and the FBI’s San Francisco Field Office are investigating the case.Assistant U.S. Attorney Katherine Lloyd-Lovett of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California and Trial Attorney Sridhar Babu Kaza of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section’s National Rapid Response Strike Force are prosecuting the case.The case was brought in coordination with the Health Care Fraud Unit’s COVID-19 Interagency Working Group, which is chaired by the National Rapid Response Strike Force and organizes efforts to address illegal activity involving health care programs during the pandemic.The Fraud Section leads the Criminal Division’s efforts to combat health care fraud through the Health Care Fraud Strike Force Program. Since March 2007, this program, comprised of 15 strike forces operating in 24 federal districts, has charged more than 4,200 defendants who collectively have billed the Medicare program for more than $19 billion. In addition, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, working in conjunction with the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services, are taking steps to hold providers accountable for their involvement in health care fraud schemes. More information can be found at https://www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/health-care-fraud-unit.On May 17, 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The Task Force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of FloridaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEMonday, April 4, 2022Miami, Florida – Raidel Figueroa, the former CEO and co-owner of Pharmatech, LLC, a drug and dietary supplement manufacturer that operated in Broward County, Florida, has made his initial appearance in Fort Lauderdale federal magistrate court to face charges that he conspired to manufacture and distribute drugs outside the regulatory oversight of the FDA, to interfere with and obstruct the FDA.The unsealed indictment charges Figueroa with conspiracy to defraud the United States, falsification of records in a federal investigation, obstruction of proceedings before an agency of the United States, and distribution of adulterated drugs in interstate commerce.The indictment alleges the following: From 2016 to 2017, Pharmatech manufactured and distributed Diocto Liquid, a drug used to treat constipation. In July 2016, FDA initiated an inspection at Pharmatech as part of an investigation into an outbreak of Burkholderia cepacia (“B. cepacia”) infections. B. cepacia is the name for a group or “complex” of bacteria typically found in soil and water.These bacteria pose little medical risk to healthy people, but people who have certain health problems like weak immune systems or chronic lung diseases may be more susceptible to B. cepacia infections. The effects of B. cepacia can include serious respiratory infections and other types of infections. Contaminated medicines can transmit B. cepacia, and the bacteria are often resistant to common antibiotics.At the close of the FDA’s Pharmatech inspection in August 2016, the FDA notified Figueroa that a water sample taken from Pharmatech’s system had tested positive for B. cepacia. In response, Figueroa advised the FDA that Pharmatech was re-engineering its purified water system to prevent future contaminations, according to the allegations.In March 2017, the FDA started another inspection at Pharmatech. FDA investigators asked Figueroa to disclose all products that Pharmatech had manufactured after it resumed manufacturing. It is alleged that Figueroa lied to the FDA investigators by, among other things, knowingly excluding Diocto Liquid from its products list (even though Pharmatech shipped over 7,000 units of the drug earlier that month) and by falsely stating to the FDA that Pharmatech’s new water system had met “acceptance criteria,” which was not true.According to the indictment, in July 2017, the CDC notified the FDA of multiple cases of B. cepacia infections in pediatric patients at Stanford Children’s Health Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital in Palo Alto, California and Johns Hopkins Children’s Center in Baltimore, Maryland.  FDA investigated and collected bottles of Diocto Liquid from these medical centers.  It is alleged that the collected bottles were from the same lot that Pharmatech distributed in March 2017 – the same one that Pharmatech failed to disclose to the FDA.  Several of the bottles contained total aerobic microbial counts and total yeast and mold counts over acceptable limits and some of the bottles also tested positive for the presence of B. cepacia, says the indictment.Juan Antonio Gonzalez, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and Justin C. Fielder, Special Agent in Charge, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations Miami Field Office, made the announcement.The FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Miami Field Office investigated the case.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Deric Zacca is prosecuting this case, with assistance from Laura Akowuah, from FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel.An indictment contains mere allegations and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.Related court documents and information may be found on the website of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida at www.flsd.uscourts.gov or at http://pacer.flsd.uscourts.gov, under case number 22-cr-60033.###Topic(s):Consumer ProtectionHealth Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - Florida, SouthernContact:Marlene Rodriguez Special Counsel to the U.S. Attorney Public Affairs Officer"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeWestern District of WashingtonFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEMonday, March 28, 2022Third federal conviction for introducing misbranded drugs into commerce; repeatedly ignored state licensing rulesTacoma - A former Port Angeles, Washington, naturopathic physician was sentenced today in U.S. District Court in Tacoma to 8 months in prison and one year of supervised release for a federal felony related to his misbranding, and sale in interstate commerce, of products he claimed could prevent and treat numerous serious diseases, including COVID-19 and MRSA, announced U.S. Attorney Nicholas W. Brown. Richard Marschall, 69, was convicted in October 2021, following a 4-day trial. The jury found Marschall guilty of Introduction of Misbranded Drugs into Interstate Commerce, his third conviction for the same crime following earlier prosecutions in 2011 and 2017. At the sentencing hearing U.S. District Judge Benjamin H. Settle said, “It is extremely dangerous during the COVID epidemic for people to be engaged in conduct that would lead other people to defer and wait to receive medical care.”“Mr. Marschall has a history of lying to patients about their health and his proposed treatments. His lies in this case are particularly troubling because he employed them when advising others about a deadly pandemic,” said U.S. Attorney Nick Brown. “As people became fearful and searched for answers, Marschall touted an unproven treatment as a miracle cure for the deadly disease. Such conduct can prevent patients from getting the legitimate treatment they need if they become ill.”According to records filed in the case, in late March 2020, Food and Drug Administration criminal investigators began reviewing complaints from the public about Facebook posts for Marschall’s products. Investigators reviewed Marschall's Facebook page which included claims that his product the “Dynamic Duo” could “crush” viruses, including the coronavirus. Marschall billed himself as a retired naturopath and “Health Coach.” Marschall’s Facebook page also claimed that his products could eliminate MRSA and other infections “even if there is antibiotic resistance.”On March 30, 2020, an FDA investigator spoke to Marschall on the telephone in an undercover capacity explaining to Marschall that she was worried about COVID-19. Marschall told the investigator that the “Dynamic Duo” contained garlic extract and larch tree starch, and further represented that one of the substances “doesn’t boost the immune system, it just kills the virus.” Marschall represented that the second substance would boost the production of white blood cells that attack infections. The undercover agent ultimately ordered the “Dynamic Duo” for $140 plus shipping.On the call with the FDA investigator, Marschall also referred to himself as “Dr. Rick Marschall.” His Facebook posts and other marketing materials for the “Dynamic Duo” also referred to Marschall as “N.D.” and “N.D. retired.” But Marschall did not have a license to practice naturopathy. In 2018, the Washington State Department of Health permanently revoked his credential to practice as a naturopath.FDA investigators received Marschall’s “Dynamic Duo” products in early April 2020, along with instructional and marketing material. The products themselves were not made by Marschall but by other manufacturers. The manufacturers’ labels for the substances do not claim to kill viruses, but the material added by Marschall stated the substances can “crush 30 different viral infections, including those in the Corona family, like in China Corona-19.”The jury found that Marschall misbranded the drugs because his marketing was false or misleading and because his products were not listed with the FDA.Marschall was convicted previously and sentenced in federal court for distributing misbranded drugs, both in 2011 and again in 2017.In asking for a year-long prison term prosecutors wrote to the court, “For decades, Marschall lied and broke the law to provide unapproved treatments and healthcare services. Marschall lied to patients. He lied to authorities. He treated patients without examining them. And he prescribed substances in unusually large doses. Marschall repeated that dangerous playbook in this case: lying to the undercover agent about his credentials, treating her and her children over the phone without a physical exam, and recommending an extremely high dose of his drug.”The case was investigated by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigation (FDA-OCI).

David Kempema, case number 11-CR-4140 in the Northern District of Iowa.  In a plea agreement in that case, Kempema admitted that, between October 2009 and July 2011, he ordered pills from India that contained the same active ingredients as Viagra and Cialis.  Kempema then sold the non-FDA-approved pills under the names of Viagra and Cialis.  On February 8, 2012, defendant was sentenced to 60 days’ imprisonment and one year of supervised release.Kempema was sentenced in Sioux City by United States District Court Chief Judge Leonard T. Strand.  Kempema was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment.  He must also serve a one-year term of supervised release after the prison term.  There is no parole in the federal system.“Individuals who sell misbranded drugs obtained from overseas are taking advantage of American consumers while putting those same consumers at risk of side effects from these drugs,” said Acting United States Attorney Timothy Duax.  “For the second time, David Kempema put the lives of others on the line because of his own personal greed.  This sentence holds him accountable for his actions and demonstrates that this type of crime will not be tolerated.”“Prescription drugs that are smuggled from overseas and are outside the secure supply chain can present a serious health risk to those who use them.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeWestern District of MichiganFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, March 11, 2022GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN– U.S. Attorney Andrew Birge announced that five defendants have been charged with conspiring to smuggle prescription drugs into the United States illegally. Brendon Gagne of Fountain, Colorado; James Funaro of Atlanta, Georgia; Jeremy Walenty of Tampa, Florida; Taylor McLaren of Colorado Springs, Colorado; and Joshua Ford of Troy, Michigan, have been charged with conspiracy to smuggle drugs into the United States for distribution in the Western District of Michigan and elsewhere. Gagne and Funaro are also charged with money laundering conspiracy, and Funaro is charged alone with a single count of money laundering.According to court documents, the defendants operated two websites – www.ExpressPCT.com and www.ExpressPEDS.ws – that sold prescription drugs and some controlled substances. www.ExpressPEDS.ws also sold anabolic-androgenic steroids. The indictment alleges that the drugs sold on the sites were manufactured largely, if not entirely, outside of the United States and smuggled into the country illegally for distribution to customers throughout the United States. According to the indictment, the sites did not ask customers for prescriptions even though the drugs sold require a person to be under the supervision of a licensed practitioner.www.ExpressPCT.com accepted Bitcoin, a type of cryptocurrency, as well as alternative forms of payment, including payments sent via digital payment networks such as Zelle and Cash App. According to the indictment, if customers elected to pay using an alternative form of payment, rather than Bitcoin or another form of cryptocurrency, co-conspirators directed payments through accounts linked to defendant James Funaro. The indictment alleges that Funaro then converted the proceeds of the scheme into cryptocurrency before they were moved to accounts held by other co-conspirators, including foreign nationals residing overseas. Overall, investigators traced at least $12 million in proceeds to the drug smuggling scheme.If convicted of conspiracy to smuggle drugs into the United States, the defendants face a statutory maximum of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. If Gagne and Funaro are separately convicted of the money laundering conspiracy charge, they face a statutory maximum of twenty years in prison and a fine of up to either $500,000 or twice the value of the funds laundered, whichever is greater.In addition to arresting the defendants, investigators also seized several luxury vehicles that Gagne allegedly purchased using proceeds of the smuggling scheme, including a Maserati and an Audi sport coupe. Investigators also seized the websites in question.Four of the five defendants made their initial appearances on March 10, 2022, in the districts of their arrest. Gagne will have his initial appearance in the District of Colorado on March 11, 2022. They will all then be arraigned in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan before Magistrate Judge Phillip J. Green on March 21, 2022.U.S. Attorney Andrew Birge of the Western District of Michigan, Inspector in Charge Rodney Hopkins of the Detroit Division of the United States Postal Inspection Service, Special Agent in Charge Lynda Burdelik of the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations Chicago Field Office, and Detective Lieutenant David Cope of the Michigan State Police Metropolitan Enforcement Team made the announcement.The United States Postal Inspection Service, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Michigan State Police are investigating the case. This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Stephanie M. Carowan and Justin Presant.An indictment is merely an accusation and is not evidence of guilt.

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, March 11,2022A Florida man who led sales for a sports and dietary supplements retailer was sentenced today to 51 months in prison for conspiring to defraud the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and conspiring to distribute anabolic steroids.According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, James Boccuzzi, 38, of Parkland, was director of sales for Blackstone Labs LLC, a Boca Raton-based sports and dietary supplements retailer. A jury convicted Boccuzzi in December 2021 of conspiracy to defraud the FDA and conspiracy to distribute anabolic steroids. U.S. District Judge William P. Dimitrouleas of the Southern District of Florida sentenced Boccuzzi to 51 months in prison and ordered him to pay a fine of $20,000.Boccuzzi and his co-conspirators, including Phillip “PJ” Braun, Aaron Singerman, Blackstone Labs LLC and others, conspired to defraud the FDA and to illegally manufacture and distribute anabolic steroids that were controlled substances under the Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act. Evidence at trial established that Boccuzzi and his co-conspirators continued to sell the illegal controlled substances despite knowing about the law and its impact on the legality of Blackstone’s steroid products.The evidence also showed that Boccuzzi and his co-conspirators quickly sold off other Blackstone products containing certain stimulants after they received an FDA warning letter notifying them that the products were unlawful to sell as dietary supplements. Further, the evidence showed that the conspirators concealed the sales of other products containing research chemicals despite knowing that the products could not legally be sold as dietary supplements. During the conspiracy, Boccuzzi also created a fraudulent “Certificate of Free Sale,” representing himself to be an employee of the FDA, in order to ship Blackstone Labs products internationally.“Dietary supplement distributors and manufacturers cannot ignore the law,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department of Justice will work with law enforcement partners to investigate and prosecute individuals and companies who disregard public safety to make a profit.”“Drug products that are disguised as supplements can pose a serious risk to the health of U.S. consumers,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin C.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeWestern District of WashingtonFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASETuesday, March 8, 2022Promoted Untested and Unproven Vaccines in Midst of PandemicSeattle – A Redmond, Washington, man who held himself out as a biotech expert was sentenced today in federal court for introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce, announced U.S. Attorney Nick Brown, 57, was sentenced to 5 years of probation and $246,986 in restitution.  Stine claimed to be Founder & President of North Coast Biologics.  In a variety of online postings from as early as March 2, 2020, Stine claimed to have developed a COVID-19 vaccine that he offered to inject in customers for $400-$1000 each.  At the sentencing hearing Magistrate Judge Brian A. Tsuchida said, “This is a difficult and troubling case…. It would be completely reasonable to send you to jail, but I’m going to give you a longer probation sentence so we can keep an eye on you.”“This wasn’t just a COVID related scheme. From 2018-2020, Mr. Stine made more than $200,000 selling cancer patients his ‘vaccines’ that he said would cure their disease,” said U.S. Attorney Nick Brown.  “He truly preyed on those who were desperate for any glimmer of hope, injecting people with unapproved substances developed in his rented garage, with no assurance of safety or purity.”According to records filed in the case, in early March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration - Office of Criminal Investigation (FDA-OCI), was alerted to Stine’s posts on social media.  An investigator contacted Stine in an undercover capacity, and Stine represented that he had a COVID-19 vaccine for sale.  Stine claimed that his main biotech effort was creating vaccines that attack cancer tumors.  He indicated that he had used a similar method to develop his COVID-19 vaccine.  On March 27, 2020, even as the undercover investigation was ongoing, FDA-OCI received a complaint from an area resident about Stine injecting a friend of the complainant with a “vaccine” for COVID-19.In early April 2020, investigators met with Stine in undercover roles.  Stine represented to the agents that he traveled across the U.S. giving his vaccine.  Stine indicated he would make a trip to Oregon and California to vaccinate family members of the undercover agents.In late April, responding to complaints from the public, the Washington State Attorney General issued a ‘cease and desist’ letter to Stine, telling him to stop making claims and offering his “vaccine” for COVID-19.  Rather than be deterred, Stine indicated it had just increased demand for his injections which he now called an “immunogen” instead of a vaccine.  In June, Stine signed a Consent Decree with the Washington State Attorney General wherein he agreed not to promote or sell his COVID-19 vaccine.Still, in August 2020, Stine again communicated with an undercover agent and traveled to Idaho to “vaccinate” the agent.  Law enforcement contacted Stine in Idaho and seized the “vaccine.”  Agents also executed a court-authorized search warrant on the Redmond warehouse where Stine claimed to conduct his research.In asking for a custodial sentence prosecutors wrote to the court, “Mr. Stine is dangerously arrogant or overwhelmingly greedy, or both. Time and again, he placed his misguided confidence and personal interest ahead of the wellbeing of the people whose health he endangered by providing them unapproved, and most likely ineffective, medical treatment; medical treatment that dissuaded them from pursuing actual effective treatment and/or from acting in ways that would protect them from infection.”“The FDA works tirelessly to identify and neutralize threats to consumers, including halting the sale of products with unproven claims to treat, prevent, or cure COVID-19 and other conditions, such as these unapproved injectable drugs that were purported to be ‘vaccines’,” said Special Agent in Charge Lisa L. Malinowski, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those whose actions threaten the public’s health in this time of heightened risks.”“It’s important for consumers to know when someone is trying to take advantage of them, and the old adage that if it’s it too good to be true then it isn’t true certainly applies here,” said Special Agent in Charge (SAC) Robert Hammer, who oversees HSI operations in the Pacific Northwest. “Legitimate businesses do not evade law enforcement agencies and they do not evade consumer safety rules. HSI Seattle appreciates the work done by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Seattle Police Department, and we will continue utilizing all of our partnerships to ensure the health and safety of our communities.”The case was investigated by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Homeland Security Investigations, and the Seattle Police Department.The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Brian Werner and Andrew Friedman.  Mr. Werner serves as the COVID-19 fraud coordinator for the U.S. Attorney’s Office.Topic(s):CoronavirusConsumer ProtectionHealth Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - Washington, WesternContact:Press contact for the U.S. Attorney’s Office is Communications Director Emily Langlie at (206) 553-4110 or Emily.Langlie@usdoj.gov."

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of New YorkFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, March 3, 2022Oakes’s Sentence Caps a Month of Convictions and Sentences in Ongoing Doping InvestigationsDamian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced that defendant CHRISTOPHER OAKES received a sentence of thirty-six months in prison today for his role in the felony drug misbranding and adulteration charges arising from this Office’s investigation of the abuse of animals through the use of performance enhancing drugs and as charged in United States v. Navarro et al., 20 Cr. 160 (MKV).  OAKES’s sentence followed the February 24, 2022, sentencing of thoroughbred trainer MARCOS ZULUETA to a term of thirty-three months in prison, and the guilty plea of harness trainer RICK DANE, JR., on February 18, 2022. OAKES and ZULUETA were each sentenced by U.S. District Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil, who will preside over the sentencing of DANE on June 21, 2022.U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “These three defendants, Christopher Oakes, Marcos Zulueta, and Rick Dane, Jr., each undertook a duty to care for and protect the health and safety of the animals under their control. Each man flagrantly violated that duty in pursuit of purse money. Oakes’s sentence today, like Zulueta’s sentence, reflects the callousness of their crimes, and the gravity with which this Office takes the kind of abuse that each practiced.”According to the allegations contained in the Superseding Informations, prior charging instruments and other filings in this case[1], and statements during court proceedings:The charges in the Navarro case arise from an investigation of widespread schemes by racehorse trainers, veterinarians, PED distributors, and others to manufacture, distribute, and receive adulterated and misbranded PEDs and to secretly administer those PEDs to racehorses competing at all levels of professional horseracing. By evading PED prohibitions and deceiving regulators and horse racing officials, participants in these schemes sought to improve race performance and obtain prize money from racetracks throughout the United States and other countries, including in New York, New Jersey, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky, and the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”), all to the detriment and risk of the health and well-being of the racehorses.  Trainers, like OAKES, ZULUETA, and DANE, who participated in the schemes stood to profit from the success of racehorses under their control by earning a share of their horses’ winnings, and by improving their horses’ racing records, thereby yielding higher trainer fees and increasing the number of racehorses under their control. Veterinarians involved in the scheme profited from the sale and administration of these medically unnecessary, misbranded, and adulterated substances.OAKES, ZULUETA, and DANE each operated their respective doping operations using customized, misbranded drugs that were intended to be untestable by racing officials. Through his fraud – and using a sham corporation, “Northfork,” to hide his actual financial interest in various horses – OAKES defrauded others of over a million dollars in purse winnings by training and racing horses that he had “doped” using a plethora of adulterated and misbranded performance-enhancing drugs (“PEDs”), including (among others) blood builders, vasodilators, “drenches,” “bleeder” pills, and other drugs not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). OAKES was also willing to engage in surreptitious delivery of drugs to notorious doper and co-defendant Jorge Navarro, who was previously sentenced to five years in prison in this matter.ZULUETA, like OAKES, supported Navarro’s racehorse doping and likewise administered illegal drugs to his racehorses under his care and control. Navarro and ZULUETA routinely discussed their use of a particular “blood builder” PED they referred to as “Monkey.” On one recorded call between ZULUETA and Navarro, Navarro stated: “the Monkey—the Monkey hits the horses hard,” later confirming, “the Monkey and the orange one . . . As far as I’m concern[ed], the Monkey and the orange one has something similar which is hitting the horses a lot.” On another recorded call, Navarro informed ZULUETA that “‘the Monkey is breaking down the horses . . . It’s breaking down . . . it’s breaking down the horses. It’s making their blood very thick.’” Still, rather than dissuade Navarro from using the product, ZULUETA agreed with Navarro that he could simply lower the dosage he was administering to his horses, while risking the horses “breaking down.” Following that conversation, ZULUETA, too, continued to procure that blood builder for use on his own horses.DANE was a New York-based trainer of standardbred horses who regularly obtained misbranded and adulterated PEDs from co-defendant Seth Fishman, and assisted in the distribution of Fishman’s products, including by “vouching” for potential clients of Fishman. Though Fishman was nominally a veterinarian, Fishman did not practice veterinary medicine, but rather used his license as a means of shielding clients, like DANE, from regulatory scrutiny – every drug that Fishman sold to DANE and others, including drugs obtained from various compounding pharmacies, were illegally misbranded, as DANE well knew. A jury convicted Fishman of two counts of misbranding conspiracy on February 2, 2022.*                *                 *In addition to the prison sentence, OAKES, 59 of Bear Creek Township, PA and ZULUETA, 54 of Bensalem, PA, were each ordered to pay a forfeiture penalty of $62,821 and $47,525, respectively.Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI New York Office’s Eurasian Organized Crime Task Force and its support of the Bureau’s Integrity in Sports and Gaming Initiative. Mr. Williams also expressed the Office’s appreciation for the Food and Drug Administration, the investigative support and substantive expertise of which was integral to the success of this case.This case is being handled by the Office’s Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit.  Assistant United States Attorneys Sarah Mortazavi, Andrew C.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of MassachusettsFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASETuesday, February 8, 2022Defendant admitted NECC created fraudulent prescriptions to avoid federal oversightBOSTON – The National Sales Director of the now-defunct New England Compounding Center (NECC) was sentenced today in federal court in Boston in connection with conspiring to defraud the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Robert A. Ronzio, 48, of North Providence, R.I., was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Richard G. Stearns to time served. In December 2016, Ronzio pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to defraud the FDA. Ronzio cooperated with the government and testified at three trials of other NECC defendants.NECC fraudulently held itself out as a pharmacy dispensing drugs pursuant to physician-created prescriptions when in fact it operated as a manufacturer distributing drugs in bulk. NECC created numerous work-around methods to make it appear to federal and state regulators that NECC was dispensing drugs pursuant to valid patient-specific prescriptions when in fact it was not.Specifically, NECC sales representatives requested that customers (hospitals and clinics) send in a list of patient names with their orders but informed the customers that NECC would not label the drugs with the names of patients, thereby allowing the customers to use the drugs for any patients. NECC sales representatives requested customers send patient rosters or appointment schedules with their orders, from which NECC employees created patient-specific prescriptions that could be provided to federal or state regulators. Furthermore, NECC would not request patient names for first orders and often waived the requirement entirely for certain customers or drug orders. To determine the number of patient names required, the former owner of NECC and head pharmacist, Barry Cadden, created ratios of patient names to the number of drug units sought in an order. Ronzio admitted that the reason for these work-around methods was to maintain NECC’s status as a pharmacy and avoid heightened regulatory oversight of the FDA.The NECC criminal case arose from the nationwide outbreak of fungal meningitis that was traced back to contaminated vials of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) manufactured by NECC. In 2012, 753 patients in 20 states were diagnosed with a fungal infection after receiving injections of MPA manufactured by NECC, and more than 100 patients died as a result. The outbreak was the largest public health crisis ever caused by a contaminated pharmaceutical drug.In December 2014, following a two-year investigation, Ronzio and 13 other owners, employees, and associates of NECC were charged in a 131-count indictment. The indictment did not charge Ronzio with having any role in the drug manufacturing operations of NECC.On July 7, 2021, Cadden was resentenced, following the government’s successful appeal of his original sentence, to 174 months in prison and ordered to pay forfeiture of $1.4 million and restitution of $82 million. On July 21, 2021, Chin was resentenced, following the government’s successful appeal of his original sentence, to 126 months in prison and three years of supervised release. Chin was also ordered to pay forfeiture of approximately $473,584 and restitution in the amount of $82 million.United States Attorney Rachael S.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeWestern District of VirginiaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, February 4, 2022DANVILLE, Va. – A former registered nurse working at Sovah Health-Danville was sentenced today to 36 months in federal prison for tampering with consumer products (fentanyl and hydromorphone) and making false statements.Emilee Kathryn Poteat, 31, pleaded guilty in May 2021 to one count of tampering with consumer products (fentanyl and hydromorphone) that affect interstate commerce, with one count of reckless disregard for the risk that another person be placed in danger of death or bodily injury, and one count of making false statements.“Those who are trusted to keep opioids and other pain medications secure must be held to the highest standards possible,” United States Attorney Christopher R. Kavanaugh said today. “When those individuals break that trust, the United States Attorney’s Office will hold them accountable to ensure the public’s trust in our medical institutions.”“Health care professionals who steal needed medications from their patients put those patients at increased risk of harm and create a disruption in the legal drug supply chain,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack of the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations – Metropolitan Washington Field Office. “We will continue to protect the public health and bring to justice health care professionals who take advantage of their unique position and compromise their patients’ health and comfort by tampering with prescription drugs.”According to court documents, beginning in January 2020, Poteat diverted and tampered with fentanyl vials and hydromorphone injectables (a/k/a Dilaudid) intended for the use of patients at Sovah Health-Danville.On May 19, 2020, it was discovered that the tops of several vials of fentanyl stored in an AcuDose machine on floor 6A had apparently been removed and tampered. Of the twenty vials of fentanyl inspected, fourteen of the vials had the tops popped off while the remaining tops fell off when touched. One of the vials had a dry white film around the rim which appeared to be superglue. To access an AcuDose machine, each registered nurse has their own unique code that must be entered to gain entry, and a review of the machine on floor 6A revealed that Poteat was the only employee who accessed the drawer where the tampered vials were found.On May 28, 2020, Poteat was interviewed by law enforcement. She denied tampering with any controlled substances  and said she did not drink alcohol or use drugs. During a subsequent interview with law enforcement on June 28, 2020, Poteat again told investigators that she did not tamper with,  use, or sell drugs, and suggested another person used her password to gain access to the AcuDose machine on 6A.In her interview with the Virginia Department of Health Professions after being terminated from  Sovah Health-Danville, Poteat admitted she had a substance abuse problem, self-medicated with opioids, and diverted the fentanyl and hydromorphone she accessed at Sovah Health-Danville for her own use.The Food and Drug Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Virginia Department of Health Professions investigated the case.Assistant U.S. Attorney Randy Ramseyer prosecuted the case.Component(s):USAO - Virginia, Western"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of New YorkFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, February 2, 2022Seth Fishman Peddled Hundreds of Customized Performance Enhancing Drugs to Racehorse Trainers Across the United States and AbroadDamian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced the conviction at trial of defendant SETH FISHMAN, DVM, on two counts of drug adulteration and misbranding, with intent to defraud and mislead, in connection with a nearly twenty-year scheme to create and distribute “untestable” performance enhancing drugs for use in professional horseracing. FISHMAN was one of over thirty defendants charged in four separate cases in March 2020, each arising from this Office’s multi-year investigation of the abuse of racehorses through the use of performance enhancing drugs.U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “The jury’s swift conviction of Seth Fishman reflects the overwhelming evidence of his guilt as displayed through this trial. As an ostensible veterinarian – sworn to the care and protection of animals – Fishman cynically violated his oath in service of corrupt trainers and in the pursuit of profits. Through the sale of untested, unsafe, and unstable drugs, Fishman’s illegal drug business was a platform for both fraud and animal abuse. Today’s conviction appropriately condemns the danger inherent in Fishman’s crimes and underscores the seriousness with which this Office takes the kind of abuse that Fishman practiced.”As established by the evidence at trial:[1]FISHMAN was charged in United States v. Navarro, 20 Cr. 160 (MKV), a case arising from an investigation of widespread schemes by racehorse trainers, veterinarians, PED distributors, and others to manufacture, distribute, and receive adulterated and misbranded PEDs and to secretly administer those PEDs to racehorses competing at all levels of professional horseracing. By evading PED prohibitions and deceiving regulators and horse racing officials, participants in these schemes sought to improve race performance and obtain prize money from racetracks throughout the United States and other countries, including in New York, New Jersey, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky, and the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”), all to the detriment and risk of the health and well-being of the racehorses.  Trainers who participated in the schemes stood to profit from the success of racehorses under their control by earning a share of their horses’ winnings, and by improving their horses’ racing records, thereby yielding higher trainer fees and increasing the number of racehorses under their control. Indicted veterinarians profited from the sale and administration of these medically unnecessary, misbranded, and adulterated substances. FISHMAN, acting as the manufacturer of customized PEDs designed specifically to evade anti-doping controls, reaped millions of dollars from the sale of his drugs to trainers around the United States and across the globe.FISHMAN specifically targeted clients in the racehorse industry, peddling dozens of unsafe and untested drugs that purported to have performance-enhancing effects on racehorses.  FISHMAN created and marketed these drugs as “untestable” under typical anti-doping drug screens and extolled the virtues of these illegal drugs by describing his method of creating customized products for individual customers in order to silo product lines to reduce the likelihood that detection of doping by trainer would undermine the remainder of FISHMAN’s corrupt clientele.In the course of nearly twenty years during which he operated his doping company, Equestology, FISHMAN took additional efforts to mislead and lie to regulatory authorities in an effort to shield his illegal activity. FISHMAN incorporated a sham business in Panama designed to appear as if his drug operation was outside the jurisdiction of U.S. authorities; he pressured employees to sign non-disclosure agreements intended to gag them if questioned by regulators; he designed labels that would provide no hint as to the provenance of the unsafe drugs shipped across the country; and he lied to state investigators regarding the nature of his business when asked directly about his role in Equestology during a Delaware state investigation in 2011, while also bragging to others that he had called in a “personal political favor” to quash that investigation.While claiming to practice as a legitimate veterinarian, FISHMAN used his veterinary license as another form of cover for his illegal drug manufacturing business. In fact, FISHMAN sold illicit drugs, including prescription drugs, under sham prescriptions for animals that he never saw or discussed. Those drugs included intravenous and intramuscular injectables that FISHMAN sold to laypeople for injection into the horses under their purported “care,” many of which were seized at premises throughout the country at the time of the original indictments in this case, including barns located in New York. Those included “blood building” drugs (for example, “BB3” and other Epogen-mimetic substances), vasodilators (for example, “VO2Max”), and bags filled with scores of “bleeder pills,” each designed to covertly increase performance in affected horses.FISHMAN was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit misbranding and drug adulteration in connection with the doping operation of convicted co-defendant Jorge Navarro. Among the horses that FISHMAN aided Navarro in doping XY Jet, a thoroughbred horse that won the 2019 Golden Shaheen race in Dubai before dying of sudden heart attack in January 2020. As established at trial, FISHMAN sold tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of PEDs to Navarro over the course of several years, and Navarro specifically credited FISHMAN for XY Jet’s performance at the Golden Shaheen.FISHMAN was further convicted of a second count of conspiracy to commit misbranding and drug adulteration in connection with the operation of Equestology, which included FISHMAN’s continuation of that offense even following his release on bail following his initial arrest in October 2019. FISHMAN faces a total of up to 20 years in prison for his convictions. The statutory maximum penalty is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of FISHMAN will be determined by the judge.* * *Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI New York Office’s Eurasian Organized Crime Task Force and its support of the Bureau’s Integrity in Sports and Gaming Initiative. Mr. Williams also expressed the Office’s appreciation for the Food and Drug Administration, the investigative support and substantive expertise of which was integral to the success of this case.This case is being handled by the Office’s Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit.  Assistant United States Attorneys Sarah Mortazavi, Andrew C. Adams, and Anden Chow are in charge of the prosecution.[1] As to Fishman’s co-defendants, these facts, including the entirety of the texts of the Indictments and the descriptions of the Indictments set forth herein, constitute only allegations and every fact described should be treated as an allegation.Component(s):USAO - New York, SouthernContact:Nicholas Biase (212) 637-2600Press Release Number:22-025"

Barksdale has sentenced Timothy Terrance DeJoris (42, Ponte Vedra) to six months’ probation and a $2,500 fine for importing from China a mislabeled erectile dysfunction drug and distributing it online and in the Jacksonville area. DeJoris had previously administratively forfeited $50,000 in proceeds from the offense. DeJoris had pleaded guilty on November 4, 2021.According to the plea agreement, on June 18, 2019, agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection intercepted two large packages that had been shipped from China. Each package was found to contain a barrel of blue capsules. An invoice for one of the barrels claimed that the capsules contained “Shiitake Mushroom Extract.” The packages were addressed to “Dr. Seltzer, LLC, Tim DeJoris” at an address in Ponte Vedra. The capsules were tested and found to contain sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra and other prescription medications used to treat erectile dysfunction in men. A search of a CPB database reflected that a similar shipment, described in the same way, had been delivered to DeJoris from the same supplier in China on June 11, 2019.During the course of the investigation, investigators discovered a website with the address of “hardonhelper.com” that sold “Dr. Seltzer’s Hard-On Helper,” which was claimed to be a “100% Natural Male Enhancement Dietary Supplement.” Investigators also discovered that, in addition to being sold on that website, the capsules were also being sold on Amazon and eBay. The price on all three websites was the same, one capsule for $10.99, six capsules for $52.99, eight capsules for $61.99, and twelve capsules for $79.99. The product was also being sold at Adam and Eve adult stores in the Jacksonville area.Records obtained from Amazon reflected that, for the period of January 1 through August 6, 2019, there were 8,043 sales of the capsules for a total of $453,413.07.When investigators questioned DeJoris about the shipments, he said that he had paid $4,000 for each shipment of 50,000 capsules. Investigators seized over 25,000 capsules from DeJoris and his business partner.“The importation of illegal, dangerous and/or mislabeled drugs is not only a crime, but it is a danger to the communities that we live in. This criminal thought he could circumvent our nation’s laws by doing just that,” said HSI Jacksonville Assistant Special Agent in Charge K. Jim Phillips. “Thanks to the law enforcement partnerships between HSI, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Tri-County Narcotics Task Force, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, this criminal was identified, investigated, and prosecuted, making our communities safer for everyone.”This case was investigated by Homeland Security Investigations, Customs and Border Protection, the Food and Drug Administration – Office of Criminal Investigations, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement HIDTA (High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area) Tri-County Narcotics Task Force.

Smith for his participation in a conspiracy to smuggle mislabeled drugs into the United States from China and sell them as dietary supplements.In October 2021, the defendant pleaded guilty to conspiracy to smuggle and resell misbranded drugs, and delivering those drugs in interstate commerce, in order to defraud the United States by impeding and impairing the lawful functions of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The charges arose from Rodriguez’s participation in a conspiracy from early 2011 until March 2017 to import from China and resell to consumers, substances falsely labelled as “all natural” dietary supplements, but which the defendant knew contained the undeclared ingredient Sibutramine, a dangerous controlled substance that could not legally be sold in the United States.Ch“The United States sets standards for controlled substances in order to keep American consumers and patients safe,” said U.S. Attorney Williams. “The defendant knowingly skirted our country’s importation laws and sold dangerous drugs under the guise of benign supplements.

Singerman is the former CEO of Blackstone. U.S. District Court Judge William P. Dimitrouleas of the Southern District of Florida sentenced Singerman to 54 months in prison and ordered him to forfeit $2.9 million.In pleading guilty, Singerman admitted to leading a conspiracy to sell products through Blackstone labeled as dietary supplements that were illegal under federal law because they were not approved by the FDA and were controlled substances. According to court documents, Blackstone defrauded the FDA as part of the scheme.“Selling products labelled as dietary supplements that actually contain controlled substances and unapproved drugs is illegal and potentially dangerous,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department of Justice will work with its law enforcement partners to prosecute dietary supplement makers who ignore the law and disregard public safety for monetary gain.”“Drug products that are disguised as dietary supplements can pose a risk to the health of U.S. consumers,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin C. Fielder of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA OCI) Miami Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who jeopardize the public health.”Singerman specifically admitted that he conspired with others from 2012 through 2017 to sell products that were unapproved new drugs and/or illegal controlled substances under the Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act. The defendant admitted that he and his co-conspirators lied to consumers by characterizing Blackstone products as safe and legal dietary supplements. In addition, he falsely represented that the products were made in “FDA approved” registered facilities that followed all required regulations, when in fact they were not. Singerman also admitted to controlling a supplement manufacturer that fraudulently imported raw ingredients for their products from China. Singerman admitted to selling other products in violation of the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, including the synthetic stimulants DMAA and DMBA, and the chemical picamilon. Singerman and his co-conspirators ignored injury reports from consumers and did not notify the FDA of such complaints, even when required by law.Six additional individual defendants and three other corporations previously pleaded guilty to charges related to the conspiracy. One additional defendant, James Boccuzzi, was convicted of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and conspiracy to defraud the FDA following a jury trial in December 2021. All 10 of these additional defendants are scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Dimitrouleas in February.FDA OCI investigated the case.Trial Attorneys Alistair Reader and Stephen Gripkey, Senior Litigation Counsel David Frank and Assistant Director John W.

Corrigan has sentenced Jerome Clampitt II to six months in federal prison, followed by six months of home detention for tampering with a consumer product, specifically, injectable fentanyl.Clampitt had pleaded guilty on October 27, 2021.According to court documents, on January 30, 2020, Clampitt, a registered nurse, was working a night shift in the intensive care unit of a hospital in Jacksonville. A patient under Clampitt’s care was prescribed and receiving an intravenous dose of fentanyl, which is used both as a pain medication and as anesthesia. Two fellow employees saw Clampitt using a syringe to inject a substance into the device that dispensed fentanyl into the patient, when there was no medically valid reason for Clampitt to do so. Laboratory testing eventually determined that the patient’s dose of fentanyl had been diluted with saline.When interviewed by law enforcement officers, Clampitt eventually admitted that he had diverted drugs from patients at the hospital for personal use. During that interview, however, he denied diluting patient drugs with saline.An audit of hospital records showed multiple discrepancies in Clampitt’s handling of controlled substances during the time he worked for the hospital, which had been less than a month. Investigators later learned that in 2019, a separate hospital had employed Clampitt and discovered discrepancies in its records that suggested he might have been diverting drugs for his own use. That hospital fired Clampitt after he refused to submit to a drug test.As part of his guilty plea, Clampitt admitted that he knew that his activities resulted in one or more critically ill patients receiving diluted fentanyl, which lacked prescribed quantities of active medication necessary to control pain. Having been deprived of medically necessary medication, such patients would endure pain and suffering and were exposed to increased risks of illness and death, stemming from, among other things, possible infection and respiratory, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal complications.This case was investigated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, and the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office – Pharmaceutical Diversion & Designer Drug Unit attached to the North Florida High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area.

Tricare and CHAMPVA are the health care benefit programs for the United States Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs.  In furtherance of the scheme, Smith—then executive vice-president of the pharmacy—and his co-conspirators paid approximately $40 million in kickbacks to patients, patient recruiters and doctors in exchange for their ordering expensive pain creams, scar creams and vitamins without regard to the beneficiaries’ actual medical needs.  The drugs were formulated to maximize profit without legitimate therapeutic value.  The reimbursement rates sometimes reached $15,000 for a one-month supply.  In addition, the pharmacy did not charge beneficiaries the mandatory copayments, something that the co-conspirators concealed.  The fraudulent billings caused a loss to the programs of approximately $88 million.Smith pled guilty to one count of conspiring to commit health care fraud.  Sentencing is scheduled for April 5, at 3:00 p.m., in Miami, before U.S. District Judge Roy K.

Sabrina Thalblum, age 52, from Cedar Rapids, received the sentence after a July 21, 2021, guilty plea to one count of acquiring a controlled substance by misrepresentation, fraud, deception, and subterfuge, and one count of adulteration and misbranding with intent to defraud and mislead.At her guilty plea and sentencing hearings, Thalblum admitted that, from about August 2018 to August 2019, she was an unlawful user of, and addicted to, fentanyl, a highly addictive opioid and controlled substance. Thalblum abused her position as a registered nurse to gain access to fentanyl at her employer, a local surgery center, and divert it to her own use. As a part of her scheme, Thalblum tampered with the vials of fentanyl. Thalblum removed the caps from vials of fentanyl at the outpatient surgery center and then carefully punctured the vials with needles and drew out the fentanyl. She then refilled the vials with saline to make the vials appear as if they still contained fentanyl. Thalblum also carefully reglued the caps of the vials to make it appear as if the vials were undisturbed, when, in truth, these consumer products no longer contained their declared values of fentanyl. In this way, the Thalblum made it appear as if the vials remained new, unopened, and filled with the controlled substance on their respective labels, that is, fentanyl, when, in truth, the Thalblum had diverted some or all of the fentanyl in the vials to herself.Thalblum was sentenced in Cedar Rapids by United States District Court Judge C.J. Williams.  Thalblum was sentenced to five years of probation and fined $10,000.  She also must forfeit her nursing license.  There is no parole in the federal system.The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Tim Vavricek and investigated by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations.Court file information at https://ecf.iand.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/login.pl.The case file number is 20-CR-102.Follow us on Twitter @USAO_NDIA.Topic(s):OpioidsComponent(s):USAO - Iowa, Northern"

The veterinary hospital held hydromorphone for sale and maintained supplies of hydromorphone for use in treating pain in the hospital’s animal patients following surgeries.As the hospital’s primary surgeon, Gries had full access to the hospital’s supply of hydromorphone. Beginning in July 2020 and without a valid prescription, Gries diverted hydromorphone for personal use by withdrawing a portion of the hydromorphone from the vial and injecting it into himself. He would then replace the diverted portion of the hydromorphone with another substance, usually either saline or butorphonal, and then return the altered hydromorphone to the supply maintained by the hospital.The Food and Drug Administration - Office of Criminal Investigations, the Drug Enforcement Administration - Diversion Control Division, and the Virginia State Police investigated the case.Component(s):USAO - Virginia, Western"

Badgley faces a maximum sentence of 10 years for the tampering charge, and a maximum sentence of 4 years for obtaining controlled substances by fraud.United States Attorney Nikolas P.

Hermsen. “FDA-OCI is proud to have partnered with the United States Attorney’s Office and its law enforcement counterparts to bring this prosecution.”“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service is committed to protecting consumers and investors from fraud,” said USPIS Inspector in Charge Nuñez. “We are proud of the dedication shown by Postal Inspectors and our partners at the U.S. FDA and the FBI by seeing this case through to a verdict.”Holmes, 37, of Woodside, Calif., founded Theranos in 2003.  Theranos was a blood testing company based in Palo Alto and Newark, Calif.  Holmes used a combination of direct communications, marketing materials, statements to the media, financial statements, models, and other information to induce investments.  She claimed Theranos had developed an analyzer, variously referred to as, among other things, the Theranos Sample Processing Unit (TSPU), Edison, or minilab.  She claimed the analyzer was able to perform a full range of clinical tests using small blood samples drawn from a finger stick.  She also represented that the analyzer could produce results that were more accurate and reliable than those yielded by conventional methods—all at a faster speed than previously possible.The evidence submitted during the trial demonstrated Holmes knowingly made materially false representations to investors and potential investors about the analyzer.  For example, the evidence showed that Holmes knew the analyzer had accuracy and reliability problems, performed a limited number of tests, was slower than some competing devices, and, in some respects, could not compete with existing, more conventional machines.  Evidence also showed that Holmes resorted to using conventional machines bought from third parties to perform much of Theranos’s blood testing.The trial included evidence that Holmes made numerous misrepresentations to potential investors about Theranos’s financial condition and its future prospects.  For example, the evidence showed that Holmes represented to investors that Theranos would generate over $100 million in revenues and break even in 2014 and that Theranos expected to generate approximately $1 billion in revenues in 2015 when, in truth, she knew Theranos would generate only negligible or modest revenues in 2014 and 2015.Further, the evidence showed that Holmes represented to investors that Theranos had a profitable and revenue-generating business relationship with the United States Department of Defense and that Theranos’s technology had deployed to the battlefield when, in truth, Theranos had limited revenue from military contracts and its technology was not deployed in the battlefield.  The evidence showed Holmes represented to investors that Theranos had been comprehensively validated by numerous major pharmaceutical companies and provided reports to investors with logos from pharmaceutical companies falsely suggesting the pharmaceutical companies endorsed Theranos.  In addition, the evidence showed that Holmes represented to investors that Theranos would soon dramatically increase the number of Wellness Centers within Walgreens stores even though Theranos’s retail Walgreens rollout had stalled because of several issues.Holmes was initially charged on June 14, 2018.  On July 28, 2020, a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging Holmes with two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349, and ten counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343.  One of the conspiracy counts alleged Holmes defrauded investors while the second count alleged Holmes defrauded patients who used Theranos services.  Similarly, the indictment charged Holmes with ten counts of wire fraud, several of the counts alleging investor fraud and several alleging Holmes defrauded patients who were induced to purchase Theranos services.The jury convicted Holmes of the investor wire fraud conspiracy count and three substantive wire fraud counts relating to the scheme to defraud investors, including wire transfers totaling more than $140 million.  The jury acquitted Holmes of the patient-related conspiracy wire fraud count and three additional wire fraud counts.  One count of wire fraud relating to a Theranos patient was dismissed during the trial.  The jury could not reach a unanimous verdict with respect to three investor fraud-related counts.Holmes faces a maximum sentence of twenty (20) years in prison, and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution, for the conspiracy count and each count of wire fraud.  However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. § 3553.Judge Davila has not yet scheduled Holmes’s sentencing hearing.  She remains free on bond, pending further hearings.Assistant U.S. Attorneys Robert S. Leach, Jeff Schenk, John C. Bostic, and Kelly Volkar are prosecuting the case with the assistance of Lakisha Holliman, Madeline Wachs, Elise Etter, Susan Kreider, and Leeya Kekona.  The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the FBI, USPIS, and FDA Office of Criminal Investigations.Topic(s):Financial FraudSecurities, Commodities, & Investment FraudComponent(s):USAO - California, Northern"

        "content": "Press ReleaseOperation Atlas21st December 2021The Food Standards Agency (FSA) welcomes today’s sentencing of a man who unlawfully sold DNP for human consumption.Mr Jack Finney has been sentenced at Chester Crown Court today for suppling 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), a highly toxic industrial chemical which he illegally sold as a diet pill for weight loss.Mr Finney will now serve 28 months in prison after products were found containing DNP at an address in Northwich during an investigation by the FSA’s NFCU and supported by Cheshire Police, UK Border Force, West Midlands Cyber Crime, the United States Food and Drugs Administration and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency.The defendant had been selling this lethal substance to people across Europe and America on the dark web between June 2017 and July 2020.DNP is poisonous to humans and can cause death, as well as other serious physical side effects. The life threatening substance DNP is often marketed as a slimming or weight loss aid and has sadly resulted in 33 deaths across the UK to date.Reginald Bevan, Deputy Head of the National Food Crime Unit said:“We welcome today’s sentencing as it sends a strong message to anyone seeking to profit from the illegal sale of this life threatening substance. We continue to be relentless in pursuing and bringing to justice those who are endangering the public and breaking the law.This operation continues to demonstrate how seriously the NFCU takes the illegal sale of DNP for human consumption in the UK and through our close working partnership with local authorities and other law enforcement agencies in the UK and abroad that we are able to tackle offenders, close websites and work to disrupt possible supply routes within and into the UK.”“Selling dangerous unapproved drugs, disguised as dietary supplements, can cause serious harm to those who buy and use the drugs,”saidU.S. Food and Drug Administration Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations Catherine A. Hermsen. “We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to bring to justice those who jeopardize the public’s health.”As DNP is an industrial chemical, there is no safe dosage and it is not made to be consumed as a diet supplement, which are often claims made by those selling the substance.The outcome of the case comes as the Home Office last week launched a consultation on proposed amendments of control measures for sales of explosives precursors and poisons under the Poisons Act 1972, which the FSA is supporting.The consultation is aimed at businesses who supply chemicals and chemical products, online marketplaces who facilitate the supply of chemicals and chemical products through their marketplaces and members of the public who use certain chemicals and chemical products in their hobbies in England, Scotland and Wales.The FSA continues to call for anyone who has information on those selling DNP for human consumption to contact the National Food Crime Unit at foodcrime@food.gov.uk or call Food Crime Confidential on 0207 276 8787.”ENDSBackground InformationThe FSA’s National Food Crime Unit (NFCU) proactively targets those found to be selling DNP to UK consumers. The unit monitors the internet to identify websites that are marketing DNP for human consumption, and the people behind them. Where such people are identified within the UK, we will work with partners to execute search warrants, seize DNP and prosecute those involved.The NFCU works with other UK law enforcement partners, such as the Border Force, and international agencies to identify those selling DNP. The unit has also launched campaigns to warn the public of the dangers of DNP and continues to highlight the dangers of consuming this toxic chemical."

In October 2020, Strickland pleaded guilty to one count of tampering with a consumer product, specifically the Schedule II controlled substance oxycodone, which is used for pain relief.While working as a registered nurse at Dighton Care and Rehabilitation Center, Strickland tampered with three blister card packages of oxycodone prescribed to an 89-year-old hospice patient who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease, severe dementia and breast cancer. To avoid detection, Strickland replaced the stolen oxycodone pills with other prescription drugs disguised to look like oxycodone.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeCentral District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, December 16, 2021LOS ANGELES– A former doctor and his company were found guilty today by a federal jury of scheming to defraud private insurance companies and the Tricare health care program for military service members by fraudulently submitting an estimated $355 million in claims related to the 1-800-GET-THIN Lap-Band surgery business.Julian Omidi, 53, of West Hollywood, and an Omidi-controlled Beverly Hills-based company, Surgery Center Management LLC (SCM), were found guilty of 28 counts of wire fraud and three counts of mail fraud. Omidi also was found guilty of two counts of making false statements relating to health care matters, one count of aggravated identity theft and two counts of money laundering. Omidi and SCM were found guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.According to evidence presented at his three-month trial, Omidi, a physician whose license was revoked in 2009, controlled, in part, the GET THIN network of entities, including SCM, that focused on the promotion and performance of Lap-Band weight-loss surgeries. Omidi established procedures requiring prospective Lap-Band patients – even those with insurance plans he knew would never cover Lap-Band surgery – to have at least one sleep study, and employees were incentivized with commissions to make sure the studies occurred.Omidi used the sleep studies to find a reason – the “co-morbidity” of obstructive sleep apnea – that GET THIN would use to convince the patient’s insurance company to pre-approve the Lap-Band procedure.After patients underwent sleep studies – irrespective of whether any doctor had ever determined the study was medically necessary – GET THIN employees, acting at Omidi’s direction, often falsified the results. Omidi then used the falsified sleep study results in support of GET THIN’s pre-authorization requests for Lap-Band surgery.Relying on the false sleep studies – as well as other false information, including patients’ weights – insurance companies authorized payment for some of the proposed Lap-Band surgeries. GET THIN received an estimated $41 million for the Lap-Band procedures.Even if the insurance company did not authorize the surgery, GET THIN still was able to submit bills for approximately $15,000 for each sleep study, receiving an estimated $27 million in payments for these claims. The insurance payments were deposited into bank accounts associated with the GET THIN entities.The victim health care benefit programs include Tricare, Anthem Blue Cross, UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Health Net, Operating Engineers Health and Welfare Trust Fund, and others.Prosecutors estimate Omidi’s total fraudulent billings at approximately $355 million.United States District Judge Dolly M. Gee has scheduled an April 6, 2022 sentencing hearing, at which time Omidi will face a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for each of the mail fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering counts, as well as a mandatory consecutive two-year sentence for aggravated identity theft.In 2014, the government seized more than $110 million in funds and securities from accounts held by individuals and entities involved in the criminal scheme, including Omidi. The government is seeking forfeiture of some or all those funds in the criminal case, and intends to pursue civil forfeiture of some or all of the assets.The criminal case against corporate defendant Independent Medical Services Inc., another company controlled in part by Omidi, has been severed from this litigation and stayed.Co-defendant Dr. Mirali Zarrabi, 59, of Beverly Hills, was acquitted of all charges.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations; the FBI; the Defense Criminal Investigative Service; IRS Criminal Investigation; and the California Department of Insurance investigated this matter.Assistant United States Attorneys Kristen A. Williams, Ali Moghaddas, David H. Chao of the Major Frauds Section, David C. Lachman of the General Crimes Section, and James E.

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, December 10,2021On Dec. 9, a federal jury in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, convicted James Boccuzzi, 37, of Boca Raton, Florida, of one count of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and one count of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances.Boccuzzi is the 11th defendant convicted in connection with Blackstone Labs LLC, a Boca Raton company that sold millions of dollars of products labeled as dietary supplements. According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Boccuzzi who was Blackstone’s director of sales, and his co-conspirators, including Phillip “PJ” Braun, Aaron Singerman, Blackstone Labs LLC and others, conspired to defraud the FDA and to manufacture and illegally distribute anabolic steroids that were controlled substances. Evidence presented at trial established that the steroid products sold by Blackstone Labs and affiliated companies became illegal controlled substances in December 2014 under a new federal law, the Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act, which amended the Controlled Substances Act. Evidence at trial established that despite knowing about the law and its impact on the legality of Blackstone’s steroid products, Boccuzzi and his co-conspirators continued selling the products for more than 18 months.The evidence also showed that Boccuzzi and his co-conspirators quickly sold off other Blackstone products containing certain stimulants after they received an FDA warning letter notifying them that the products were unlawful to sell as dietary supplements. Further, the evidence showed that the conspirators concealed the sales of other products containing research chemicals despite knowing that the products could not legally be sold as dietary supplements.Braun and Singerman each pleaded guilty on Nov. 17 to conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and to selling unapproved new drugs. Blackstone Labs pleaded guilty on Nov. 19 to the same charges as Braun and Singerman, as well as to conspiracy to defraud the FDA and to commit mail and wire fraud. Five other individual defendants and two corporate entities involved in the sale of Blackstone Labs products previously pleaded guilty to related charges.“It is illegal to sell drugs and controlled substances as dietary supplements,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The department will work with its law enforcement partners to prosecute individuals and companies that market potentially dangerous products, such as designer steroids, in violation of the Controlled Substances Act and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.”“Products mislabeled as dietary supplements can pose a serious risk to the health of U.S. consumers,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin C. Fielder of the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI) Miami Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who jeopardize the public health by selling violative products.”Boccuzzi was remanded to the custody of the U.S. Marshals following trial, and he is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 17, 2022, in Fort Lauderdale before U.S. District Judge William P. Dimitrouleas of the Southern District of Florida. Boccuzzi faces a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison. Braun, Singerman, and Blackstone are scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 27, 2022. The court will determine any sentences after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.The trial and plea agreements resulted from a multi-year investigation conducted by the FDA-OCI Miami Field Office.Trial Attorneys Alistair Reader and Stephen Gripkey, Senior Litigation Counsel David Frank, and Assistant Director John W.

Bannister also received international shipments of controlled substances and misbranded drugs at his residence, including pills containing the opioids Tapentadol and Tramadol, as well as Carisoprodol, a muscle relaxant. After receiving the controlled substances, Bannister and others unlawfully redistributed them, typically by U.S. mail, to customers across the United States. In June 2021, law enforcement executed a search warrant at Bannister’s residence and seized 14,449 pills containing Schedule II and IV drugs.Bannister faces a maximum sentence of up to 20 years of imprisonment, up to lifetime supervised release, and up to a $1,000,000 fine. The Court will determine the sentence with reference to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.Acting United States Attorney Jonathan A. Ophardt commended the collaborative investigative efforts of the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigation, Homeland Security Investigations, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and the Rutland City Police Department. “The importation and sale of diverted and counterfeit pharmaceuticals feeds the opiate crisis with pills cloaked in fraudulent legitimacy. The cost of addiction is borne by our communities, while the money pilfered from addicted individuals lines the pockets of foreign criminals. I applaud our investigatory partners for targeting the facilitators who play a vital role in supporting these international criminal organizations.”“Misbranded and counterfeit prescription drugs that are smuggled from overseas can present a serious health risk to those who buy and use them. The drugs may contain unknown ingredients, may be made under unknown conditions, and may be used without the supervision of a licensed medical professional,” said Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey J. Ebersole, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations New York Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who traffic in misbranded or counterfeit prescription drugs.”“Bannister peddled opioids and other dangerous substances, bringing them across borders and into New England and the rest of the United States,” said Matthew Millhollin, Special Agent in Charge for the Homeland Security Investigations’ Boston Field Office, which covers all of New England. “Cases like these require strong partnerships and HSI is proud to work with our law enforcement partners to prevent the illicit flow of controlled substances into the country.”“Responding to the increased prevalence of diverted or counterfeit pharmaceuticals in New England is among DEA’s highest priorities” stated Brian Boyle, DEA New England’s Special Agent in Charge. “This Vermont based international drug smuggling organization shows that every corner of New England is being targeted by drug trafficking organizations for distribution of these deadly substances. DEA and our federal, state and local partners are committed to bringing to justice, those who are fueling our country’s unprecedented opioid epidemic.”“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service and our law enforcement partners will continue to dedicate the necessary resources to fight drug trafficking in our communities,” said Inspector in Charge Ketty Larco-Ward of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service’s Boston Division. “The Postal Service has no interest in being the unwitting accomplice to anyone using the U.S. Mail to distribute illegal drugs.”Bannister is represented by Assistant Federal Public Defender David McColgin.

Bastian accepted Tuller’s guilty plea and scheduled a sentencing hearing for March 17, 2022, in Spokane.According to court documents and information disclosed during Tuller’s change of plea hearing, between August 2019 and April 2020, Tuller was a Washington-licensed registered nurse employed at the Confluence Health Clinic in Moses Lake. Her position as a nurse provided her with access to medications, including opioid narcotics such as morphine, an opioid derivative commonly prescribed by hospitals and health care facilities to relieve pain.While working at Confluence Health, Tuller used syringes to remove morphine from at least 17 vials, and then ingested that morphine as part of her own opioid addiction. She then replaced the morphine with a saline solution that was essentially salt dissolved in water and attempted to glue the caps back onto the vials to make them appear intact. Before Tuller was apprehended by law enforcement, at least one Confluence Health patient who was prescribed morphine had to be rushed to the emergency room; that patient continued to be in excruciating pain after receiving only saline from what was supposed to be morphine vials.United States Attorney Vanessa R. Waldref emphasized that part of her mission to ensure a safe and strong community in Eastern Washington includes addressing the opioid epidemic in all of its forms. “While Ms. Tuller’s addiction to opioids is both tragic and far too common, her decision to take advantage of her access to medical-grade morphine was an egregious breach of trust. It is deeply troubling that she compounded her misconduct by secretly replacing that morphine with saline in vials that she knew would be distributed to patients. She recklessly and seriously endangered the safety of patients who rely on the judgment and integrity of health care professionals every day.”The drug tampering charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, a $250,000 fine, and up to 3 years of court supervision after release.United States Attorney Waldref underscored how important it is to detect crimes like these. “I commend the outstanding investigative work by the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Diversion Group as well as the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations. This case demonstrates that DEA, FDA, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office will work tirelessly to protect and strengthen our communities both by combatting opioid abuse wherever it occurs, and by holding accountable anyone who abuses a position of trust to access dangerous drugs or put vulnerable patients at risk.”Frank A. Tarentino III, Special Agent in Charge of DEA’s Seattle Field Division, highlighted DEA’s ongoing work against the abuse of opioids. “Ms. Tuller’s reckless actions violated her oath as a medical professional and undermined the trust and confidence of the public. During this national opioid crisis, people are depending on health care and law enforcement professionals to keep our communities safe from anyone who seeks to exploit the system designed to provide care and treatment for those in need.”“The FDA oversees the U.S. drug supply to ensure that it is safe and effective, and those who knowingly tamper with medicines put patients’ health at risk,” added Special Agent in Charge Lisa L. Malinowski of the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office. “We will continue to protect public health and bring to justice any health care professionals who take advantage of their unique positions or compromise their patients’ health and comfort by tampering with needed drugs.”This investigation was conducted by the DEA’s Diversion Group in the Seattle Field Office, and the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, Seattle Domicile. Assistant United States Attorneys Dan Fruchter and Tyler H.L. Tornabene are prosecuting this matter on behalf of the United States.Topic(s):OpioidsPrescription DrugsComponent(s):USAO - Washington, EasternPress Release Number:No. 2:21-CR-00163-SAB (E.D. Wash.)"

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, December 3,2021On Dec. 2, a federal jury in Greeneville, Tennessee, convicted Peter Bolos, 44, of Tampa, Florida, of 22 counts of mail fraud, conspiracy to commit health care fraud and introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce, following a month-long trial.According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Bolos and his co-conspirators, Andrew Assad, Michael Palso, Maikel Bolos, Larry Smith, Scott Roix, HealthRight LLC, Mihir Taneja, Arun Kapoor, and Sterling Knight Pharmaceuticals, as well as various other companies owned by them, deceived pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), such as Express Scripts and CVS Caremark, regarding tens of thousands of prescriptions. The PBMs processed and approved claims for prescription drugs on behalf of insurance companies. Bolos and his co-conspirators defrauded the PBMs into authorizing claims worth more than $174 million that private insurers such as Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee, and public insurers such as Medicaid and TRICARE, paid to pharmacies controlled by the co-conspirators.Court documents and evidence at trial established that Bolos, Assad and Palso owned and operated Synergy Pharmacy in Palm Harbor, Florida. Under their direction, Synergy agreed with Scott Roix, a Florida telemarketer operating under the name HealthRight, to generate prescriptions for Synergy and the other pharmacies involved in the scheme. The prescriptions were typically for drugs such as pain creams, scar creams and vitamins. To obtain the prescriptions, evidence showed Roix used HealthRight’s telemarketing platform as a telemedicine service, calling consumers and deceiving them into agreeing to accept the drugs and to provide their personal insurance information. HealthRight then paid doctors to authorize the prescriptions through its telemedicine platform, even though the doctors never communicated directly with the patients and relied solely on the telemarketers’ screening process as the basis for their authorizations. Because this faulty and fraudulent process made the prescriptions invalid, the drugs were misbranded under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Synergy and the other pharmacies nonetheless dispensed the drugs to consumers as part of the scheme, so that Bolos could submit fraudulent reimbursement claims.Court documents and evidence at trial established that during the conspiracy, which lasted from May 2015 through April 2018, Bolos paid Roix more than $30 million to buy at least 60,000 invalid prescriptions generated by HealthRight. Evidence showed Bolos selected specific medications for the prescriptions that he could submit for highly profitable reimbursements. In addition, Bolos used illegal means to hide his activity from the PBMs so that he could remain undetected. Evidence showed that Bolos was responsible for at least $89 million out of the total $174 million in fraudulently paid billings.“The defendants deceived consumers in order to facilitate the distribution of drugs without proper medical oversight, and overbilled insurers for illegal prescriptions,” said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Arun G. Rao of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department will continue to investigate and prosecute individuals who use telemedicine to advance fraudulent schemes that violate the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.”“The United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Tennessee applauds the unwavering efforts of the multiple agencies involved in this collaborative investigation to bring this extensive healthcare fraud and misbranding scheme to justice,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Francis M. Hamilton III for the Eastern District of Tennessee. “The scope and nature of this fraud and misbranding scheme shock the conscience. Patients were given medications that they neither requested nor wanted, and the trial proof demonstrated that the prescriptions were specifically chosen by Bolos to maximize the fraudulent scheme’s profits, rather than for the patients’ healthcare needs. The guilty verdict against Bolos and the guilty pleas obtained from his co-defendants should send a strong message that the Department of Justice will aggressively prosecute fraud against health insurance providers.”“Healthcare fraud is an egregious crime problem that impacts every American,” said Special Agent in Charge Joseph E. Carrico of the FBI’s Knoxville Field Office. “The guilty verdict was a result of a multi-agency investigation into a complex health care fraud scheme that required substantial investigative resources. Along with its law enforcement partners, the FBI remains committed to investigate these crimes and prosecute all those that are intent in defrauding the American public.\"“Distributing misbranded prescription drugs in the U.S. marketplace places patients’ health at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin C. Fielder of the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Miami Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who put profits ahead of public health.”“Bolos and his co-conspirators used their pharmacies to fraudulently bill insurance companies hundreds of millions of dollars, and that type of health care fraud impacts everyone,” said Special Agent in Charge John Condon of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Tampa. “HSI will continue to work with our law enforcement partners at the federal, state and local level to investigate all fraud and bring those responsible to justice.”“Bolos and his co-conspirators sought to increase their profits by executing a comprehensive health care fraud scheme involving innocent patients,” said Special Agent in Charge Derrick L. Jackson of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General. “This conviction should serve as a warning to individuals who wish to deceive the government and steal from taxpayers. Alongside our law enforcement partners, we will continue to pursue medical professionals who engage in fraudulent activity.”“The verdict in this case sends a clear message that these types of schemes will not be tolerated,” said Special Agent in Charge Matthew Modafferi of the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General in the Northeast Area Field Office. “The Special Agents of the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General will continue to work closely with the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners to bring to justice those who commit these kinds of offenses.”Roix, Assad, Palso, Smith, Maikel Bolos and various associated business entities previously pleaded guilty to their roles in the conspiracy. Taneja, Kapoor, and Sterling Knight pleaded guilty to felony misbranding in a conspiracy with Bolos. U.S. District Judge J. Ronnie Greer set sentencing for Bolos for May 19, 2022, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee at Greeneville. Sentencings for the other defendants will be set for dates in 2022.The trial and plea agreements resulted from a multi-year investigation conducted by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Office of Inspector General (Nashville); Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations (Nashville); U.S. Postal Service, Office of Inspector General (Buffalo); Federal Bureau of Investigation (Knoxville and Johnson City, Tennessee); Office of Personnel Management Office of Inspector General (Atlanta); and the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations (Tampa). The U.S. Marshals Service also assisted in the investigation and the forfeiture of assets.Assistant U.S. Attorneys TJ Harker and Mac Heavener for the Eastern District of Tennessee and Trial Attorney David Gunn of the Department of Justice Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch in Washington, and a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in Knoxville, prosecuted and tried the case.

Following her term of incarceration, Nickel-Tangeman will serve one year of supervised release.According to court documents, Ms. Nickel-Tangeman used her position as Registered Nurse to access the rooms of patients she was not assigned to care for in a separate unit of a Colorado hospital. The defendant falsely and fraudulently told patients that she was conducting a “study” on the effectiveness of Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) pumps, which deliver controlled substances to hospital patients to relieve pain on-demand when the patient pushes a button.  The defendant then used a key to open the machine that secured the syringe of hydromorphone that was to be dispensed to the patient. The defendant removed a portion of the drug from the syringe, which she kept, then returned the syringe to the patient’s PCA. The defendant illegally obtained controlled substances in this way from three patients on four occasions. When confronted by law enforcement regarding her actions, the defendant lied about the diversions and persisted in her false story that she was engaged in a study with a well-known university. The defendant engaged in obstructionist conduct by producing to law enforcement a false e-mail that she stated came from a friend who asked her to participate in the research.  The defendant created the false e-mail herself using a fictitious e-mail account she created in the name of this alleged friend.“Medical professionals who criminally abuse their positions of trust will be held accountable,” said United States Attorney Cole Finegan.  “Our office’s priority is to protect the public and the health care system our citizens rely upon for their medical care.”“The FDA oversees the U.S. drug supply to ensure that it is safe and effective, and those health care professionals who fraudulently obtain needed medicines from patients put those patients’ health at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L.

Honig announced.Alain Bouaziz, 68, a French citizen and resident of the United Arab Emirates, was arrested at Newark Liberty Airport while attempting to depart the United States. Bouaziz is charged by complaint with making false statements to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). He is scheduled to appear today by videoconference before U.S. Magistrate Judge Cathy L. Waldor.According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:Bouaziz is a French citizen and resident of the United Arab Emirates who represented himself to be the chief operating officer of Hexim Pharmaceuticals (Hexim), a company headquartered in Secaucus, New Jersey. Hexim was known as Alkopharma USA Inc. until its name was changed in June 2013.Beginning in February 2018, Bouaziz submitted forged documents and made false statements to the FDA to fraudulently gain control of Sanorex, a weight-loss pharmaceutical owned by a major international pharmaceutical company (Pharmaceutical Company-1). Bouaziz sent letters and documents by email and in hard copy to the FDA falsely stating that Hexim had purchased the New Drug Application for Sanorex and requesting a meeting about marketing Sanorex in the United States. Bouaziz knew these representations were false because Hexim had not purchased the rights to Sanorex from Pharmaceutical Company-1. The documents that Bouaziz submitted to the FDA contained multiple forgeries and false statements, including one example where an earlier agreement between Alkopharma and Pharmaceutical Company-1 had been altered to purport to show a sale of Sanorex to Hexim.The false statements charge carries a maximum term of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss caused by the offense, whichever is greatest.Acting U.S. Attorney Honig credited special agents of the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigation, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey Ebersole, with the investigation leading to the charges.The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Hayden M.

Braun is Blackstone’s CEO and former President, and Singerman is the former CEO of Blackstone.On Nov. 17, Braun and Singerman pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(E), and 846, and to selling unapproved new drugs, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a), and 333(a)(2). On Nov. 19, Blackstone Labs pleaded guilty to the same charges as Braun and Singerman, as well as to one count of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and to commit mail and wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.In pleading guilty, Braun and Singerman admitted to leading a conspiracy to sell products through Blackstone that were labeled as dietary supplements but were actually controlled substances or drugs that were not approved by the FDA. Blackstone made the same admissions, and also admitted to having defrauded the FDA and consumers by selling illegal substances falsely labeled as dietary supplements.The defendants specifically admitted that, from 2012 through 2017, they conspired to sell products that were unapproved new drugs and/or illegal controlled substances under the Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act. The defendants admitted that they falsely characterized their products as safe and legal dietary supplements. In addition, they falsely represented that the products were made in “FDA approved” registered facilities that followed all required regulations, when in fact they were not. The defendants also admitted to controlling a supplement manufacturer that fraudulently imported raw ingredients for their products from China. Braun and Singerman both admitted to selling many other products in violation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, including synthetic stimulants DMAA and DMBA, and the “nootropic” chemical picamilon. The defendants ignored injury complaints from consumers and did not notify the FDA of complaints, even when required by law. As part of their plea agreements, the defendants also agreed to forfeit all proceeds of these crimes, with Braun forfeiting $3 million, Singerman forfeiting $2.9 million and Blackstone forfeiting $1 million.“Dietary supplements are regulated to protect the health of American consumers,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department of Justice will prosecute individuals and corporations who sell dangerous products while misrepresenting that they are safe and legal dietary supplements.”“Consumers who use dietary supplements expect those products to be safe,\" said Assistant Commissioner Catherine A. Hermsen for FDA Criminal Investigations. \"Products mislabeled as dietary supplements can pose a serious risk to the health of U.S. consumers. We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who jeopardize the public health.”Braun and Singerman are scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 27, 2022, in Ft. Lauderdale before U.S. District Judge William P. Dimitrouleas of the Southern District of Florida. Both face a maximum penalty of 13 years in prison.

Tucker for smuggling smokeless tobacco products across state lines to avoid paying the associated taxes.The defendant operated Capital Trade, Inc., a tobacco wholesaler based in Bristol, PA. During the charged conduct, Al Najar and his associates transported almost $40 million worth of tobacco from Pennsylvania to New York, while failing to pay millions of dollars in New York state excise taxes on that tobacco. In order to hide his scheme, the defendant and his associates created false invoices and filed false documents with Pennsylvania and New York regulators which substantially underreported the amount of tobacco sold. Al Najar also failed to register and report as an interstate seller of smokeless tobacco as required by the Prevent All Cigarette Smuggling Act (PACT Act).“The defendant thought he found a loophole to fast money, by cheating both Pennsylvania and New York out of substantial taxes owed for the sale of tobacco products,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Williams. “But now he is the one paying the price.

None of the drugs the defendants distributed were approved by the FDA, and the defendants were not permitted to distribute the drugs without the approval of the FDA. Substances distributed by the defendants were misbranded and included misleading labeling that did not include accurate drug/active ingredient names, labeling that did not contain adequate directions for use, and labeling that did not contain the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor. The court was advised that the defendants acted with the intent to defraud the FDA, by impeding, impairing, obstructing, and defeating the ability of the FDA to regulate the manufacturing, labeling, and distribution of drugs in the United States.“Thomas and Sara Mouton began by distributing steroids to their associates in the fitness and body building industry, but their business ultimately expanded through word of mouth to serving a couple hundred clients,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Kaufman. “Individuals who defraud the FDA will be held accountable for their crimes.”“The requirements that prescription drugs are labeled appropriately and approved by FDA before they are marketed help ensure the health and safety of consumers,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office. \"The FDA will continue to aggressively pursue those who place the public health at risk.”Judge Ranjan scheduled sentencing for March 3, 2022. The law provides for a total sentence of not more than five years in prison, a fine of $250,000, or both. Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the actual sentence imposed is based upon the seriousness of the offense and the prior criminal history, if any, of the defendant.Assistant United States Attorney Christopher M. Cook is prosecuting this case on behalf of the government.The United States Postal Inspection Service, along with the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, conducted the investigation that led to the prosecution of Thomas and Sara Mouton.Topic(s):Prescription DrugsComponent(s):USAO - Pennsylvania, Western"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeCentral District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, November 3, 2021SANTA ANA, California– A physician has been found guilty of 26 felony charges for fraudulently distributing an unapproved cancer treatment over a six-year period, charging up to $2,000 per bottle, the Justice Department announced today.Benedict Liao, 81, a.k.a. “Wada Masao,” and “Masao A. Wada,” of Fullerton, was found guilty on Tuesday afternoon of seven counts of wire fraud, 11 counts of selling a misbranded drug and eight counts of selling an unapproved new drug.According to evidence presented at his five-day trial, Liao operated the Oeyama-Moto Cancer Research Foundation, which had offices in Monterey Park and, later, in West Covina.Using the alias \"Masao A. Wada, M.D.\" Liao submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2011 and 2012 an Investigational New Drug (IND) application in which he stated that he planned to engage in clinical trials of a product called Allesgen, which he told FDA and stated in promotional material was intended to treat and cure many types of cancer. FDA received these applications and both times informed Liao that the IND applications for Allesgen had been placed on a full clinical hold due to deficiencies in the submissions.The FDA required that a drug distributed under an IND application bear a label stating that it was a “New Drug – Limited by Federal…law to investigational use” andLiao told FDA that he would place a label on Allesgen with such a statement. Instead of doing so, Liao manufactured Allesgen in Fullerton and distributed the unapproved drug with a label calling Allesgen a “supplement,” not a drug, and this label stated that it “had not been evaluated by the FDA” and was not intended to treat any disease.From July 2012 through June 2014, Liao sold and distributed Allesgen at a price generally set at $2,000 per bottle, plus shipping, to customers in various states and in foreign countries, because of which he received at least approximately $850,000 in revenue. From approximately July 2014 through January 2018, Liao continued to sell and distribute additional bottles of Allesgen to customers in various states and in foreign countries, as a result of which he received additional revenue totaling approximately $765,000.The jury found that Liao schemed to defraud buyers of Allesgen by failing to inform them it was not an approved cancer treatment, that FDA had placed it on hold, barring any distribution of it, that he was not allowed to charge anything for it, and that it could have side effects that were unpredictable and could be serious. Several Allesgen buyers testified during the trial, described sending tens of thousands of dollars to Liao, explained that the information Liao did not disclose would have been important to know, and one said that he would not have purchased it had he been told that it was unapproved.United States District Judge James V. Selna has scheduled a February 14, 2022 sentencing hearing, at which time Liao will face a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for each wire fraud count and three years’ imprisonment for each of the 19 additional counts.The FDA investigated this matter.Assistant United States Attorney Lawrence E.

Maldonado-López, the secretary, and María de Lourdes Irizarry-Rodríguez, an associate of the company, were charged and pled guilty on November 2, 2021, to participating in a mail fraud conspiracy to illegally sell weight loss products. The defendants marketed, sold, and delivered through the mail what they described as dietary supplements for weight loss but were in fact misbranded drugs containing ingredients that were not declared on the products’ labeling. W. Stephen Muldrow, United States Attorney for the District of Puerto Rico, and Justin C. Fielder, Special Agent in Charge of the FDA, Office of Criminal Investigations Miami Field Office, announced the convictions of the defendants for their role in the scheme. Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) collaborated during the investigation.Specifically, as part of the scheme, from 2018 through May 2021, the defendants sold products which contained undeclared drugs—sibutramine, phenolphthalein, and tadalafil. The defendants purchased the products from suppliers in China and used Facebook and the BAJA PESO YA INC. website to advertise and promote the illegal products. The defendants delivered the products to their customers via mail across the United States.The products the defendants sold included:“Slimmer Extreme”, which was labeled as containing a “Thermogenic Formula” that will “Help contain appetite and hunger cravings” and “Support losing excess body fat”;“Adipotrim Hardcore”, which was labeled as containing an “Original Formula” to “Reduce waist and hip size,” “Lose weight starting in one week,” “Most weight loss advanced formula,” and “Boost energy and metabolism”;“Adipessum”, which was labeled as “Miracle Slimming Capsules” containing an “Advanced Formula” that “Burns Fat and Calories” and will “Boost Energy,” “Control Appetite,” “Speed Metabolism,” and “Eliminate Excess Water”; and“Li Da Daidaihua,” which was labeled as “Weight Loss Capsules” “Made of Natural Herbs” and “Safe and Free of Side Effects.”From April 2015 through July 2019, the FDA published notifications via www.fda.gov for products sold by the defendants:FDA Notification DateProductFDA Lab Results04/30/15Li Da DaidaihuaContained undeclared sibutramine11/20/17AdipessumContained undeclared sibutramine and phenolphthalein01/28/19Slimmer ExtremeContained undeclared sibutramine and phenolphthalein07/01/19LiproContained undeclared tadalafil07/16/19Reduktis MaxContained undeclared sibutramineSibutramine is a Schedule IV controlled substance banned by the FDA in October 2010 because of a risk of heart problems and strokes. Sibutramine is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Meridia, a new drug approved by FDA for marketing in 1997 for prescription treatment of obesity, and subsequently withdrawn from the United States market on December 21, 2010, after clinical data indicated sibutramine poses an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.Phenolphthalein is a chemical that is not an active ingredient in any approved drug in the United States. Phenolphthalein was used in some laxative products until 1999. The FDA no longer recognizes the drug as “safe and effective.” Studies have indicated that it presents a cancer-causing risk.Tadalafil is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Cialis, an FDA-approved drug used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED).“Consumers must be able to trust that the products they buy are safe and the claims on the product’s label can be relied on,” said U.S. Attorney Muldrow. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to take action against irresponsible business owners that make unsubstantiated claims about products that can lead to serious health issues.”“Products that claim to be dietary supplements but contain unapproved drug ingredients pose a serious risk to public health,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin C. Fielder, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Miami Field Office.  “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who put profits above the health and safety of U.S. consumers.”“Protecting the health and safety of consumers is one of HSI San Juan’s highest priorities,” said HSI Special Agent in Charge Ivan J. Arvelo. “This investigation demonstrates how law enforcement partners work jointly to investigate these criminals and bring them to justice.”“At a time when the United States Postal Service is playing such a critical role in the nation’s supply chain, Postal Inspectors will be ever vigilant in our pursuit of criminals who use the U.S. Mail to ship counterfeit prescription drugs.  We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to prevent the conveyance of misbranded medications that can potentially cause severe injury or harm to unsuspecting consumers,” said Inspector in Charge Raymundo Marrero, Newark Division.As part of their guilty pleas, the defendants agreed to forfeit $400,000, which were proceeds traceable to the mail fraud conspiracy. The defendants face a maximum sentence of twenty years in prison; a fine not to exceed $250,000; and a supervised release term of not more than three years.The FDA-OCI-SJP led the investigation with the collaboration of Homeland Security Investigations and the US Postal Inspection Service.

Burdelik, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Chicago Field Office and Mario M. Pinto, Special Agent in Charge of the Chicago Region of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector GeneralSentenced was Patrick Wittbrodt, 46.  In addition to the custodial sentence, United States District Judge Laurie J. Michelson also ordered that Wittbrodt be placed on a two-year term of supervised release.  In addition, Wittbrodt was ordered to pay $7,317,173.51 in restitution to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and $902,387.93 in restitution to Medicare. As part of his plea agreement, Wittbrodt also agreed to forfeit approximately $72,000 seized by federal agents.According to court documents, Wittbrodt and his co-defendants caused an approximate $8,000,000 loss to Medicare and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan (“BCBS”). Some of this money was stolen from UAW members’ prescription insurance accounts.Court documents outlined the scheme:Due to the high reimbursement rate paid by Medicare and BCBS for prescription pain cream, scar cream, pain patches and/or vitamins, defendants targeted these insurance plans. Wittbrodt and others would then schedule time at various UAW meetings where defendants would tout pain cream, scar cream, pain patches and vitamins to the UAW members.  An aspect of the presentation was that the UAW members could receive their prescriptions free -- without paying a prescription drug copay at the pharmacy.  UAW members did not realize that acceptance of the “free” medications would cost their health care fund millions of dollars.Defendants would then collect the UAW members’ insurance information along with their family members’ insurance information.  According to court documents, Dr. April Tyler, who also pleaded guilty in the case, would then authorize the pain cream, scar cream, pain patch and/or vitamin prescriptions for the UAW members and/or their family members.  Defendant Dr. Tyler did not establish a valid doctor-patient relationship with any of the UAW members, did not perform a physical exam and did not determine medical necessity for the prescriptions she wrote for the UAW members.  The prescriptions were not, therefore, legally eligible for reimbursement from the various insurance companies.  Defendant Dr. Tyler also pre-signed prescription forms and allowed defendants to choose which compounded creams, patches and vitamins to write on the prescriptions.Wittbrodt directed the prescriptions to various pharmacies.  The pharmacies would fill the prescriptions, bill the UAW members’ insurance and pay a monetary kickback to Wittbrodt.  Wittbrodt would then provide remuneration to co-conspirators from the kickbacks he received.  The prescriptions were periodically re-filled and/or re-billed, regardless of whether the UAW member requested a refill or not.  The prescription co-pay was waived at the pharmacy for the UAW members. Another defendant, Jeffrey Fillmore, is scheduled for sentencing on November 23, 2021.“The unlawful actions of these defendants diverted taxpayer dollars and medications from patients who actually needed them in order to line their own pockets,” said Acting United States Attorney Saima Mohsin.  “We will continue to aggressively prosecute health care fraud and hold those who commit it accountable.”“Medical professionals who try to enrich themselves by billing federal health care programs for medically unnecessary prescription medications threaten the integrity of these programs and waste valuable taxpayer dollars that are otherwise utilized to provide medications that patients genuinely need,” said Mario M. Pinto, Special Agent in Charge of the Chicago Region of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General. “Our agency, working together with our law enforcement partners, will continue to pursue criminals who threaten these vital health care programs.”“Schemes that solicit and provide unneeded prescription drugs to patients erodes the confidence that U.S. consumers have in their health care professionals and others in positions of trust,” said Special Agent in Charge Lynda M. Burdelik, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Chicago Field Office. “Medical professionals and others should know that the FDA will investigate and bring to justice those involved in the illegal distribution of prescription drugs.”“This case demonstrates that collaboration between law enforcement and private insurance investigators is essential in prosecuting those responsible for federal healthcare fraud and kickback violations,” said by Dan Crowell, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, Director of Corporate and Financial Investigations.This case was investigated by the United States Department of Health and Human Services – Office of Inspector General, the United States Food and Drug Administration and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, under the supervision of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Philip A.

Barron; Special Agent in Charge James R. Mancuso of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Baltimore; Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack of the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Field Office; Postal Inspector in Charge Daniel A. Adame of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service - Washington Division; and Chief Melissa R. Hyatt of the Baltimore County Police Department.According to his guilty plea, Oluwalade conspired with others to obtain access to a bank account for use in the fraud scheme.  Oluwalade admitted that he knew the bank account would be used for a fraud scheme but was not aware of the specifics of the scheme.  The scheme called for Oluwalade to be compensated for his role in obtaining bank accounts for use in the scheme.As detailed in Oluwalade’s guilty pleas, the scheme involved the creation of a fake domain, named “Modernatx.shop” (the “Fake Domain”), which appeared visually similar to Company 1’s actual home page, including in the trademarked logos for Company 1, colors and markings.  Company 1 is a biotechnology company that focuses on drug discovery, drug development, and vaccine technologies, including a vaccine for COVID-19. According to the plea agreement, unlike Company1’s website, the Fake Domain had the text: “YOU MAY BE ABLE TO BUY A COVID-19 VACCINE AHEAD OF TIME,” with a link to “Contact us.”Oluwalade admitted that on November 13, 2020, he received a message from an individual asking him to obtain bank accounts to be used in the fraud scheme.  On November 16, 2020, a co-conspirator texted Oluwalade that he had located someone who would allow them to use his Navy Federal Credit Union account for the fraud scheme.  The co-conspirator provided Oluwalade with the banking information, which he sent to a second co-conspirator.On January 11, 2021, an HSI Special Agent, in an undercover capacity (“UC”), contacted a number listed on the Fake Domain, which investigators determined was linked to an account on an encrypted messaging application which also allows voice-over-Internet calls and video chats.  The number replied approximately two hours later requesting an e-mail address to contact the UC, which the UC provided. Approximately four minutes later the UC received an e-mail from sales@modernatx.shop, an e-mail address which appears on the Fake Domain, purporting to welcome the UC to Company 1 and providing a brief description of Company 1 and the storage requirements of Company 1’s vaccine.After several additional e-mails, the UC received information regarding payment, delivery, and purchase for alleged Company 1 vaccines from a Google e-mail address.  The UC was sent a purported invoice for 200 doses of Company 1’s vaccine at $30.00 per dose, for a total of $6,000, with payment terms listed as 50% up front and 50% upon delivery.  The UC was allegedly instructed to send payment to the Navy Federal Credit Union account discussed above.  The UC transferred a portion of the funds to the account as directed.According to his plea agreement and court documents, on January 15, 2021, the government seized the fake domain and executed a series of search warrants, including at the home of the co-conspirator with the Navy Federal Credit Union account.  Investigators used that co-conspirator’s phone to send Oluwalade a message: “Yo where u want me send the bread?” (referring to the cash investigators had sent to Williams’s bank account for the purchase of alleged vaccines as directed).  Oluwalade replied, “Yea send me some thru zelle and some through cash app.”  Both Zelle & Cash App are online payment platforms.  Oluwalade provided his Cash App User ID name, and investigators made a cash transfer of the funds to Oluwalade’s Cash App account per his request.Odunayo “Baba” Oluwalade faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for the wire fraud conspiracy.   U.S. District Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher did not schedule a sentencing date.On May 17, 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The Task Force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.

Clampitt II (42, Saint Johns) has pleaded guilty to tampering with a consumer product, specifically, injectable fentanyl. He faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in federal prison. A sentencing date has not yet been set.According to the plea agreement, on January 30, 2020, Clampitt, a registered nurse, was working a night shift in the intensive care unit of a hospital in Jacksonville. A patient under Clampitt’s care was prescribed and receiving an intravenous dose of fentanyl, along with other medications for anesthesia. Two fellow employees saw Clampitt using a syringe to inject a substance into the device that dispensed fentanyl into the patient, when there was no medically valid reason for Clampitt to do so. Laboratory testing eventually determined that the patient’s dose of fentanyl had been diluted with saline.When interviewed by law enforcement officers, Clampitt eventually admitted that he had diverted drugs from patients at the hospital for personal use. During that interview, however, he denied diluting patient drugs with saline.An audit of hospital records showed multiple discrepancies in Clampitt’s handling of controlled substances during the time he worked for the hospital.  Investigators later learned that in 2019, a separate hospital had employed Clampitt and discovered discrepancies in its records that suggested he might have been diverting drugs for his own use. That hospital fired Clampitt after he refused to submit to a drug test.As part of his guilty plea, Clampitt admitted that he knew that his activities resulted in one or more critically ill patients receiving diluted fentanyl, which lacked prescribed quantities of active medication necessary to control pain. Having been deprived of medically necessary medication, such patients would endure pain and suffering and were exposed to increased risks of illness and death, stemming from, among other things, possible infection and respiratory, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal complications.This case was investigated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations and the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office.

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASETuesday, October 26,2021Darknet Narcotics Vendors Selling to Tens of Thousands of U.S. Residents ChargedToday, the Department of Justice, through the Joint Criminal Opioid and Darknet Enforcement (JCODE) team joined Europol to announce the results of Operation Dark HunTor, a coordinated international effort on three continents to disrupt opioid trafficking on the Darknet. The operation, which was conducted across the United States, Australia, and Europe, was a result of the continued partnership between JCODE and foreign law enforcement against the illegal sale of drugs and other illicit goods and services. Operation Dark HunTor builds on the success of last year’s Operation DisrupTor and the coordinated law enforcement takedown earlier this year of DarkMarket, the world’s then-largest illegal marketplace on the Darknet. At the time, German authorities arrested the marketplace’s alleged operator and seized the site’s infrastructure, providing investigators across the world with a trove of evidence. Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and JCODE have since been compiling intelligence packages to identify key targets.Following the DarkMarket takedown in January 2021, U.S. and international law enforcement agencies identified Darknet drug vendors and buyers, resulting in a series of complementary, but separate, law enforcement investigations. Operation Dark HunTor actions have resulted in the arrest of 150 alleged Darknet drug traffickers and other criminals who engaged in tens of thousands of sales of illicit goods and services across Australia, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Prior to, but in support of Operation Dark HunTor, Italian authorities also shut down the DeepSea and Berlusconi dark web marketplaces which boasted over 40,000 advertisements of illegal products. Four alleged administrators were arrested, and €3.6 million in cryptocurrencies were seized in coordinated U.S.-Italian operations.Operation Dark HunTor resulted in the seizure of over $31.6 million in both cash and virtual currencies; approximately 234 kilograms (kg) of drugs worldwide including 152.1 kg of amphetamine, 21.6 kg of cocaine, 26.9 kg of opioids, 32.5 kg of MDMA, in addition to more than 200,000 ecstasy, fentanyl, oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methamphetamine pills, and counterfeit medicine ; and 45 firearms. Darknet vendor accounts were also identified and attributed to real individuals selling illicit goods on active marketplaces, as well as inactive Darknet marketplaces such as Dream, WallStreet, White House, DeepSea, and Dark Market.Operation Dark HunTor led to 65 arrests in the United States, one in Bulgaria, three in France, 47 in Germany, four in the Netherlands, 24 in the United Kingdom, four in Italy, and two in Switzerland. A number of investigations are still ongoing.“This 10-month massive international law enforcement operation spanned across three continents and involved dozens of U.S. and international law enforcement agencies to send one clear message to those hiding on the Darknet peddling illegal drugs: there is no dark internet. We can and we will shine a light,” said Deputy Attorney General Monaco. “Operation Dark HunTor prevented countless lives from being lost to this dangerous trade in illicit and counterfeit drugs, because one pill can kill. The Department of Justice with our international partners will continue to crack down on lethal counterfeit opioids purchased on the Darknet.”“The men and women of the department’s Criminal Division, in close collaboration with our team of interagency and international partners, stand ready to leverage all our resources to protect our communities through the pursuit of those who profit from addiction, under the false belief that they are anonymous on the Darknet,” said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Only through a whole of government and, in this case, global approach to tackling cyber-enabled drug trafficking can we hope to achieve the significant results illustrated in Operation Dark HunTor.”“The FBI continues to identify and bring to justice drug dealers who believe they can hide their illegal activity through the Darknet,” said FBI Director Christopher A. Wray. “Criminal darknet markets exist so drug dealers can profit at the expense of others’ safety. The FBI is committed to working with our JCODE and EUROPOL law enforcement partners to disrupt those markets and the borderless, worldwide trade in illicit drugs they enable.”“Today, we face new and increasingly dangerous threats as drug traffickers expand into the digital world and use the Darknet to sell dangerous drugs like fentanyl and methamphetamine,” said Administrator Anne Milgram of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). “These drug traffickers are flooding the United States with deadly, fake pills, driving the U.S. overdose crisis, spurring violence, and threatening the safety and health of American communities. DEA’s message today is clear: criminal drug networks operating on the Darknet, trying to hide from law enforcement, can no longer hide. DEA, the U.S. interagency, and our valued international partners, are committed to dismantling drug networks wherever they are, including on the Darknet.”“Illicit darkweb marketplaces represent a significant threat to public health, economic, and national security,” said Acting Director Tae Johnson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). “By working collaboratively and sharing intelligence across local, state, federal, and international law enforcement agencies, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and its partners are disrupting and dismantling transnational criminal organizations responsible for introducing dangerous narcotics and other contraband into our communities.”“The dark web has become an underground facilitator of illegal commerce,” said Chief Postal Inspector Gary Barksdale of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS). “Criminals use the dark web to sell and ship narcotics and other dangerous goods around the world, often relying on the postal system and private carriers to deliver these illegal products. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service is committed to finding and stopping these drug traffickers.”“The Darknet no longer provides a concealing cloak for criminals to operate,” said IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Chief Jim Lee. “The expertise of our agents and law enforcement partners helped uncover significant quantities of narcotics and money — both cash and virtual currency — derived from illicit means.”“The point of operations such as the one today is to put criminals operating on the dark web on notice: the law enforcement community has the means and global partnerships to unmask them and hold them accountable for their illegal activities, even in areas of the dark web,” said Europol’s Deputy Executive Director of Operations Jean-Philippe Lecouffe.The extensive operation, which lasted 10 months, resulted in dozens of federal operations and prosecutions, including:•    Four search warrants were executed in furtherance of a multiagency investigation resulting in the seizure of approximately $1 million in drug proceeds (including approximately $700,000 in cryptocurrency), eight firearms, one vehicle, and various controlled substances including MDMA, LSD, and cocaine. The FBI, DEA, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and USPIS jointly conducted the investigation. According to court documents, the targets of the investigation were operating over multiple Darknet marketplaces to traffic methamphetamine, counterfeit pressed Adderall (containing methamphetamine), MDMA, cocaine, and ketamine to customers throughout the United States. The investigation revealed that the organization’s base of operations was in Houston, Texas, and the organization shipped to various cities throughout the United States. Six defendants are charged in a five-count indictment in the Southern District of Ohio with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, distribution of controlled substances, sale of counterfeit drugs, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.•    The FBI in conjunction with the USPIS, FDA, and DEA, had been investigating a criminal enterprise that operated two Darknet vendor accounts. One of the accounts was operated out of the Miami area and the other out of the Providence, Rhode Island, area. According to court documents, the vendors, Luis Spencer, 31, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Olatunji Dawodu, 36, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida; and Alex Ogando, 35, of Providence, Rhode Island, allegedly advertised and sold pressed fentanyl pills throughout the United States. Agents identified several other co-conspirators and obtained search and arrest warrants for each. During the execution of the warrants, agents seized approximately $770,000, one weapon and approximately 3.5 kilograms of pressed fentanyl. Spencer, Dawodu, and Ogando are charged in the District of Columbia with conspiracy to distribute 400 grams or more of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of fentanyl.•    Kevin Olando Ombisi, 32, and Eric Bernard Russell Jr, 36, both of Katy, Texas, are alleged to have participated in Darknet controlled substances trafficking activities using the moniker Cardingmaster and are charged in a 10-count indictment in the Western District of Tennessee with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, distribution of controlled substances, attempted unlawful distribution of controlled substances, sale of counterfeit drugs, money laundering conspiracy, and mail fraud. According to court documents, Ombisi and Russell are alleged to have used the moniker Cardingmaster and conspired and attempted to, and did unlawfully distribute the Schedule II controlled substance methamphetamine, which was falsely represented to be Adderall, through the mail in the Western District of Tennessee and elsewhere. In conjunction with their arrests, the government seized more than $5 million in assets alleged to be connected to the drug trafficking activity. The case was investigated by the DEA, HSI, USPIS, and the FDA, and is being prosecuted by the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Tennessee.An indictment and criminal complaint are merely allegations, and the defendant, are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.Operation Dark HunTor was a collaborative initiative across JCODE members, including the Department of Justice; FBI; DEA; USPIS; ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI); IRS-Criminal Investigation; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF); Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) and the FDA’s Office of Investigations. This operation was aided by non-operational supporting participation from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Local, state, and other federal agencies also contributed to Operation Dark HunTor investigations through task force participation and regional partnerships. The investigations leading to Operation Dark HunTor were significantly aided by support and coordination by the Department of Justice’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF), multi-agency Special Operations Division, the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section’s Digital Currency Initiative, Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section, the Fraud Section, the Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs, the National Cyber Joint Investigative Task Force (NCJITF), Europol and its Dark Web team and international partners Eurojust, Australian Federal Police (AFP), Bulgaria’s General Directorate Combating Organized Crime (Главна дирекция Борба с организираната престъпност), France’s National Police (Police National - OCLCTIC) and National Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie Nationale – C3N), Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt), Central Criminal Investigation Department in the German city of Oldenburg (Zentrale KriminaIinspektion Oldenburg), State Criminal Police Offices (Landeskriminalämter), State Criminal Police Office of Lower Saxony (LKA Niedersachsen), various police departments (Dienststellen der Länderpolizeien), German Investigation Customs ( Zollfahndungsämter), Italy’s Finance Corps (Guardia di Finanza) and Public Prosecutor’s Office Brescia, the Netherland’s National Police (Politie), Switzerland’s Zurich Canton Police (Kantonspolizei Zürich) and Public Prosecutor's Office II of the Canton of Zurich (Staatsanwaltschaft II), and the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency (NCA) and NPCC.Federal prosecutions are being conducted in more than 15 federal districts, including the Central District of California, the Eastern District of California, the Northern District of California, the District of Columbia, the Southern District of Florida, the District of Massachusetts, the District of Nebraska, the District of Nevada, the Western District of New York, the Southern District of Ohio, the Northern District of Texas, the Eastern District of Virginia, the Western District of Virginia, the District of Rhode Island, the Western District of Tennessee, and the Western District of Washington.JCODE is an FBI-led Department of Justice initiative, which supports, coordinates, and assists in de-confliction of investigations targeting for disruption and dismantlement of the online sale of illegal drugs, especially fentanyl and other opioids.

Scola Jr. of the Southern District of Florida to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. According to court documents, Tejeda worked at Tellus Clinical Research, a medical clinic based in Miami. Tejeda served as a project manager and study coordinator for clinical drug trials. As part of his plea agreement, Tejeda admitted that he agreed with others to falsify data in medical records in connection with clinical trials intended to evaluate various medical conditions, including opioid dependency, irritable bowel syndrome and diabetic nephropathy. Among other things, Tejeda falsified data to make it appear as though subjects were participating in the trials when, in truth, they were not.“The defendant’s conduct put profits before public health,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Justice Department will continue to work with its partners at the Food and Drug Administration to investigate and prosecute anyone who engages in this conduct.”“The public relies on the accuracy and honesty of clinical trial data,” said U.S. Attorney Juan Antonio Gonzalez for the Southern District of Florida. “Falsifying clinical data not only violates the public’s trust, it also endangers the safety of consumers. Those who unlawfully profit by compromising the public’s health in this way commit serious crimes and will be prosecuted.”“FDA’s evaluation of a new drug begins with an analysis of reliable and accurate data from clinical trials,” said Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations Catherine A. Hermsen of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations. “Compromised clinical trial data could impact the agency’s decisions about the safety and effectiveness of the drug under review. We will continue to monitor, investigate and bring to justice those whose actions may subvert the FDA approval process and endanger the public health.”Tejeda faces a maximum penalty of twenty years in prison.

Brown.   Richard Marschall, 68, was convicted following a 4-day trial.  The jury found Marschall guilty of Introduction of Misbranded Drugs into Interstate Commerce, his third conviction for the same crime following earlier prosecutions in 2011 and 2017.  Sentencing in front of U.S. District Judge Benjamin H. Settle likely will occur in early 2022.According to records filed in the case, in late March, 2020, Food and Drug Administration criminal investigators began reviewing complaints from the public about Facebook posts for Marschall’s products. Investigators reviewed Marschall's Facebook page which included claims that his product the “Dynamic Duo” could “crush” viruses, including the coronavirus.  Marschall billed himself as a retired naturopath and “Health Coach.”  Marschall’s Facebook page also claimed that his products could eliminate MRSA and other infections “even if there is antibiotic resistance.”On March 30, 2020, an FDA investigator spoke to Marschall on the telephone in an undercover capacity explaining to Marschall that she was worried about COVID-19.  Marschall told the investigator that the “Dynamic Duo” contained garlic extract and larch tree starch, and further represented that one of the substances “doesn’t boost the immune system, it just kills the virus.”  Marschall represented that the second substance would boost the production of white blood cells that attack infections.  The undercover agent ultimately ordered the “Dynamic Duo” for $140 plus shipping.On the call with the FDA investigator, Marschall also referred to himself as “Dr. Rick Marschall.” His Facebook posts and other marketing materials for the “Dynamic Duo” also referred to Marschall as “N.D.” and “N.D. retired.” But Marschall did not have a license to practice naturopathy. In 2018, the Washington State Department of Health permanently revoked his credential to practice as a naturopath.FDA investigators received Marschall’s “Dynamic Duo” products in early April 2020, along with documents.  The products themselves were not made by Marschall but by other manufacturers.  The manufacturers’ labels for the substances do not claim to kill viruses, but still Marschall included documents that stated the substances can “crush 30 different viral infections, including those in the Corona family, like in China Corona-19.”The jury found that Marschall misbranded the drugs because his marketing was false or misleading and because his products were not listed with the FDA.In 2011 and again in 2017, Marschall was convicted and sentenced in federal court for distributing misbranded drugs.  For the current conviction, Marschall faces up to three years in prison and a $10,000 fine.The case was investigated by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigation (FDA-OCI).  The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Nicholas Manheim, Michelle Jensen, and Brian Werner.Topic(s):CoronavirusConsumer ProtectionHealth Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - Washington, WesternContact:Press contact for the U.S. Attorney’s Office is Communications Director Emily Langlie at (206) 553-4110 or Emily.Langlie@usdoj.gov."

U.S. District Court Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton scheduled sentencing for Feb. 23, 2022. Wells was charged along with three others on Aug. 26, 2021.Wells was the owner of Priority Payout, an independent sales organization based in Florida, whose clients included merchants engaged in prohibited or high-risk transactions and merchants that had already been terminated from card payment processing networks such as Visa and Mastercard for fraud, chargeback, or other compliance concerns. Wells referred merchant clients of Priority Payout seeking payment processing services to Allied Wallet Inc., a payment processing company that obtained for its clients access to services that enabled them to accept debit and credit card payments over global electronic payment networks run by Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover, among others (card brands) and served as an intermediary between its merchant clients and financial institutions that were members of the card brand networks (acquirers).Wells engaged in a scheme to defraud several acquirers, the card brands and others of money and property by knowingly misrepresenting that his merchant clients were engaged in the sale of low-risk retail goods to obtain debit and credit card payment processing for those clients from banks and credit card companies and fraudulently inducing them to provide payment processing services to these merchant clients. According to the charging documents, Wells and his co-conspirators accomplished this by, among other means, creating shell companies, designing fake websites that purported to sell low-risk retail goods and using industry-standard codes that miscategorized the true nature of the transactions. Through the scheme, Wells admitted that he personally obtained approximately $700,000 in fraudulent payment card processing proceeds.The charge of wire fraud conspiracy provides for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release, a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, forfeiture and restitution. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.Acting United States Attorney Nathaniel R.

Heroman, 43, formerly of Charlotte, appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge David S. Cayer on Monday, October 4, 2021, and pleaded guilty to receiving and delivering a misbranded medication, announced William T. Stetzer, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina.Derrick L. Jackson, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General for the region including North Carolina, and Justin C. Fielder, Special Agent in Charge of the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI), Miami Field Office, join Acting U.S. Attorney Stetzer in making today’s announcement.Dr. Heroman is an ophthalmologist and the former owner of a now-closed ophthalmology clinic, Carolina Retina and Vitreous Consultants (CRVC). According to plea documents filed with the court, as early as September 2013, Dr. Heroman caused CRVC to order and receive an unapproved, foreign and cheaper drug which he used to treat patients with macular degeneration, instead of using Lucentis®, the medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of the condition in the United States. As Dr. Heroman admitted in court yesterday, he purchased the foreign, unapproved medication because it cost less than the name brand Lucentis®. At the same time, Dr. Heroman caused CRVC to bill Medicare for the non-covered and non-reimbursable unapproved medication as if it were FDA-approved and kept the difference in price as profit.In addition to pleading guilty to the criminal charge, Dr. Heroman and CRVC have also agreed to pay $450,000 to resolve the United States’ allegations that they violated the False Claims Act, when they knowingly submitted or caused to be submitted false claims for payment to Medicare related to the administration of unapproved medications. The claims resolved by the civil settlement are allegations only and there has been no determination of liability.In making today’s announcement, Acting U.S. Attorney Stetzer said, “Dr. Heroman sought to increase his profit margins by using an unauthorized medication, potentially putting the health of his patients at risk.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeEastern District of MichiganFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, October 6, 2021BAY CITY – A Texas woman was sentenced today to six months in federal prison for introducing a misbranded drug into interstate commerce, announced Acting United States Attorney Saima Mohsin.Mohsin was joined in the announcement by Special Agent in Charge Lynda Burdelik, Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Sentenced was Judith Holloway 34, of Watauga, Texas.  Holloway pleaded guilty before United States Magistrate Judge Patricia Morris on June 2, 2021.According to court documents, 2,4-Dinitrophenol (DNP) is a chemical substance that, when ingested, causes rapid loss of weight, but is also associated with a high rate of adverse effects including cataracts, hyperthermia, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmia, and death. In 1938, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared DNP to be extremely dangerous and not fit for human consumption. At that time, the FDA announced publicly that it would prosecute those who manufacture and distribute DNP for use as a drug.According to the indictment, between October 2018 and May 2020, Holloway sold DNP to consumers throughout the United States and in a number of foreign countries and misbranded the substance as a yellow pigment powder.  Holloway purchased bulk DNP and utilized eBay and other websites to market and sell the drug over the internet. Holloway did not label the package as DNP, nor did she include any directions or warnings regarding the use of the drug when she mailed it to consumers. The defendant also utilized eBay and other means to post DNP for sale to consumers as a pigment powder.  The defendant listed DNP on eBay and falsely labeled the DNP as “Yellow Pigment Powder DNP.”  eBay removed her listings for violating the company’s policy prohibiting the sale of hazardous items, medicines and drugs that require a prescription or are labeled Rx/Rx only on the packing as required by the FDA.  The defendant was undeterred by the removal and relisted the DNP on eBay on three separate occasions utilizing a different email address and false label.Acting United States Attorney Mohsin stated, “This sentence should send a clear message to those who would profit from the sale of dangerous unapproved drugs that we will utilize every tool at our disposal to vigorously prosecute you in order to protect the health and safety of the general public. We urge everyone to refrain from ingesting DNP for any reason.”“Ignoring FDA requirements and selling dangerous unapproved drugs online can cause serious harm to those who use the drugs,” said Special Agent in Charge Lynda M. Burdelik, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Chicago Field Office.  “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who jeopardize consumers’ health.”This case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Regina R. McCullough. The case was investigated by special agents of the Food and Drug Administration.Topic(s):Consumer ProtectionComponent(s):USAO - Michigan, Eastern"

Stearns to two years in prison and two years of supervised release. The judge reserved judgment on restitution for a later date. On April 2, 2021, Ceron pleaded guilty to five counts of delivery for pay of an adulterated or misbranded medical device received in interstate commerce with the intent to defraud or mislead.“For 15 years, Ms. Ceron chose to make money by injecting her cosmetics customers with toxic silicone – all the while knowing that by doing so she was exposing them to serious harm, disfiguration and potentially death,” said Acting United States Attorney Nathaniel R. Mendell. “We are committed to protecting the health and safety of the public, and the sentence imposed by the court shows that people who callously put people at great risk of harm will be punished.”“Injecting silicone oil not approved for human use can result in serious bodily injury or death,” said Jeffrey J. Ebersole, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, New York Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who offer this dangerous product to the public.”From approximately 2004 to 2019, Ceron, who operated her business in Lawrence, performed illegal bodily injections using “gluteal material” that she obtained from a source in Florida. Lab tests of the material subsequently confirmed that it contained silicone oil – a substance that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns can travel through blood vessels and cause a stroke, death or permanent disfigurement.In 2018, Ceron agreed to perform buttock enhancing and facial injections for an individual. During a recorded meeting on May 24, 2018, Ceron told the individual that she charged $500 for buttock injections and $60 for each wrinkle-filling injection. A search of Ceron’s business in Lawrence the following month resulted in the seizure of several bottles and syringes of a substance that tests revealed to be silicone oil. Numerous uncapped, used syringes were also recovered from the business.Ceron admitted to performing illegal injections to augment the buttock or fill wrinkles of five victims in exchange for money and misled her victims about her qualifications and the identity and safety of the material she was injecting. According to court documents, the government estimates that hundreds or thousands of individuals may be victims of the illegal injections she performed.Acting U.S. Attorney Mendell, FDA OCI SAC Ebersole and Justin C. Fielder, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, Miami Field Office made the announcement today. Assistant U.S. Attorney Rachel Y.

He stated that he had never worked in the United States without authorization and that he never violated the terms or conditions of his non-immigration status. Pérez-Camacho knew his answers were false since he had worked in 2018 and 2019 in Puerto Rico without authorization in an unlicensed dental practice.“We are seeing an upward trend of foreign persons traveling to PR to illegally practice medicine and dentistry, and we need to be aware of these doctors and urge the community not to give them the opportunity to practice illegally in PR,” said U.S. Attorney Muldrow. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to protect the public from misbranded products, and to ensure that doctors are practicing medicine legally.”“The Diplomatic Security Service is firmly committed to working with the U.S. Attorney’s Office to investigate visa fraud, especially when the health and safety our citizens are unnecessarily placed at risk,” said Walter Rios, the newly appointed Resident Agent-In-Charge of the DSS San Juan Resident Office. “Traveling to the U.S. with the purpose of illegally practicing medical professions is a growing trend and a very serious matter that DSS is addressing with the help and support of our interagency partners”.“American patients rely on the FDA to ensure that their prescription drugs and devices are safe and effective,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin C.

Reviews of the labeling conducted by FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health on the injectable HA devices seized from Affordable Care confirmed various differences between the outer box and carton labels, patient information brochures, and instructions for use between the FDA-approved labeling for Supartz, Orthovisc, Synvisc, Synvisc-One and Euflexxa versus the labeling included with the unapproved versions being distributed by Affordable Healthcare. The value of the devices seized were in excess of $800,000.As a result of the plea agreement, Affordable Healthcare Solutions, LLC pled guilty to a felony, was fined and ordered to forfeit the $837,000 worth of medical devices seized during the search warrant executed by Special Agents with the FDA.Juan Antonio Gonzalez, Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and Special Agent in Charge, Justin C.

Kaufman announced today.United States District Judge David Stewart Cercone imposed the following sentences on the following individuals:38-month term of imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release on Devan Abrams, age 40, of West 37th Street, New York, New York;38-month term of imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release on Azad Khizgilov, age 47, of Dahlgren Place, Brooklyn, New York; and28-month term of imprisonment followed by two years of supervised release on Roman Shaulov, age 54, of Shore Parkway, Brooklyn, New York.According to information presented to the court, including in a public filing, for years these defendants enriched themselves by leading a massive and sophisticated fraud scheme that facilitated the black-market importation and sale of tens of millions of dollars of dangerous and addictive prescription medications and controlled substances. In summary, they established and ran a business that, through a series of misrepresentations, misled various credit card companies into processing credit card transactions for purchases of drugs that were illegal to be sold in the United States. These drugs were often imported from Russia, China, India, and other countries. The complex scheme involved front companies, fake websites, and a tangled web of bank accounts.“Committing fraud was the full-time job of these defendants,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Kaufman. “They manipulated friends and even family members to serve as owners of front companies, they had a cadre of employees whom they supervised and trained to commit fraud, and they created and executed a complex scheme that allowed them, for years, to deceive sophisticated financial institutions. Now they have been held accountable for their criminal actions.”“When prescription drugs from outside FDA’s secure supply chain enter the U.S. marketplace, patients are put at risk. The risk is even greater when the criminals disguise the purchase of these unlawful drugs to avoid detection,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S.

In addition to home confinement, he will pay $66,000 in monetary penalties and will be permanently excluded from participating in federal healthcare programs.According to court documents, Michael Olshavsky, conspired to receive and pay kickbacks to encourage urine drug screen testing performed by a lab in Florida. Some of the testing referred to the lab was paid for by Medicare, Virginia Medicaid, and TennCare. Co-conspirator John Linke was sentenced last week to three months home confinement.“Using an opioid treatment practice to defraud federal and state health care programs is unconscionable and a serious federal crime,” Acting U.S. Attorney Daniel P.

Arguello sentenced Mr. Vasquez to three months’ imprisonment.  The sentence also includes one year of supervised release with conditions requiring 100 hours of community service.  The defendant must also make state licensing authorities aware of his conviction and cooperate with their procedures.  The government recommended a lower sentence in this case in consideration of the defendant’s confession and cooperation in disclosing everything known about his diversion of drugs, which was a matter potentially affecting the public health and integrity of the health care system.  The felony offense in this case had a maximum sentence of four years of imprisonment and a fine of $250,000, per count.The investigation in this case was conducted by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, and the Drug Enforcement Administration.Assistant United States Attorney Bryan Fields prosecuted the case.CASE NUMBER:  20-cr-00067-CMA# # #Visit our website http://www.justice.gov/usao/co | Follow us on Twitter @DCoNewsTopic(s):OpioidsPrescription DrugsComponent(s):USAO - Colorado"

According to court filings, the products actually contained ingredients that made the products unapproved drugs and illegal to distribute.

From on or about November 14, 2018, to on or about February 14, 2019, Forester admitted he knowingly, intentionally and unlawfully obtained oxycodone and hydrocodone, Schedule II controlled substances, by misrepresentations, fraud, and deception. Forester admitted he did not place the controlled substances into the inventories of the four pharmacies and did not maintain records to show the controlled substances were dispensed. In addition, Forester admitted he relabeled generic drugs as name brand medications and then sold them as if they were the more expensive drugs. Finally, Forester admitted filling prescriptions with generic drugs, but billing Medicare and Medicaid for the more expensive name brand drugs, thereby committing health care fraud and causing a loss to Medicare and Medicaid of approximately $680,000.“Timothy Forester ordered opioids without adding them to inventory, mislabeled generic drugs as name-brand medications, and billed Medicare and Medicaid for name-brand drugs when he provided generics, all in violation of federal law,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Kaufman, “We will continue to pursue medical professionals who engage in fraud schemes to enrich themselves at the expense of their patients.”“U.S. consumers rely on health care professionals to follow FDA requirements pertaining to prescription medications.

Kaufman announced today.Joshua Fulton, 41, Bolivia, North Carolina, pleaded guilty to one count before United States District Judge Christy C. Wiegand.In connection with the guilty plea, the court was advised that Fulton owned or operated several businesses that sold substances designed to mimic the effects of steroids, a Southeast Asian plant called kratom, and products labeled as nootropics. In connection with the sale of these products, Fulton’s businesses made claims about the health effects that would result from their consumption, and Fulton was aware that most of his customers consumed his products as drugs—in other words, to obtain those purported effects. To evade regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the sale of drugs in interstate commerce, Fulton and his co-conspirators included disclaimers on their websites and the parcels shipped to consumers, falsely indicating that the products were not for human consumption. They also failed to register the facility where these substances were produced and distributed with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, as required by law. In connection with his plea, Fulton agreed to forfeit approximately $10.7 million in funds traceable to his businesses.“Joshua Fulton sold SARMs (Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators) over the internet, a substance which mimics the effects of anabolic steroids, and other substances by misbranding the products in a scheme to avoid regulations by the FDA,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Kaufman. “As this case demonstrates, we are committed to prosecuting anyone who uses deceitful practices to defraud the United States.”“The requirement that FDA approve new drugs before they are marketed is designed to ensure the health and safety of consumers,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office. “The FDA will continue to aggressively pursue those who place the public health at risk and compromise the integrity of the regulatory system by purposely evading scrutiny.”“For generations, humans have looked for quick fix, and still, that 'all-natural' remedy could cause serious health effects.

Seesholtz pleaded guilty to manufacturing between 40,000 and 60,000 pills of the anabolic steroids at a warehouse in Berwick, Pennsylvania. He also admitted to selling some of the anabolic steroids through a storefront in Kingston, Pennsylvania, while others were sold online by his coconspirators. Federal agents seized pill presses and encapsulating machines during the course of the investigation.The case was investigated by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Food and Drug Administration, and Homeland Security Investigations.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of ColoradoFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASESaturday, August 28, 2021DENVER – In two separate cases, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Colorado held nurses accountable after they stole controlled substances from their patients.Katie Muhs, age 34, of Littleton, CO, was sentenced for her felony conviction for illegally obtaining fentanyl through fraud and deception while on the job as a Registered Nurse in a hospital’s Intensive Care Unit.Alicia Nickel-Tangeman, age 44, formerly of Woodland Park, Colorado, entered guilty pleas to four counts of obtaining controlled substances using fraud and deception while she was on the job as a Registered  Nurse at a hospital in Colorado.Ms. Muhs was employed as a registered nurse in the Intensive Care Unit at a hospital in Colorado in 2019 when she used her position to divert fentanyl, a schedule II controlled substance, for her own personal use.  The defendant admitted that between June 2019 and September 2019, she stole fentanyl by removing it from the IV bags of ventilated patients using a sterile syringe. She also admitted to stealing fentanyl remaining in vials of the drug after patient administration. The defendant stated she would remove the excess drug from the vials and replace the stolen drug with saline, then have a fellow nurse witness her “waste,” or dispose of, the saline. In pleading guilty to the single-count Information in the case, charging a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 843(a)(3), the defendant specifically admitted that on September 8, 2019, she removed a bag of fentanyl from the automated medication control machine at the hospital under a different nurse’s login credentials. She then removed fentanyl from the IV bag for personal use.Ms. Nickel-Tangeman used her position as Registered Nurse to access the rooms of patients she was not assigned to care for in a separate unit of a Colorado hospital. The defendant falsely and fraudulently told patients that she was conducting a “study” on the effectiveness of Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) pumps, which deliver controlled substances to hospital patients to relieve pain on-demand when the patient pushes a button.  The defendant then used a key to open the machine that secured the syringe of hydromorphone that was to be dispensed to the patient. The defendant removed a portion of the drug from the syringe, which she kept, then returned the syringe to the patient’s PCA. The defendant illegally obtained controlled substances in this way from three patients on four occasions. When confronted by law enforcement regarding her actions, the defendant lied about the diversions and persisted in her false story that she was engaged in a study with a well-known university. The defendant engaged in obstructionist conduct by producing to law enforcement a false e-mail that she stated came from a friend who asked her to participate in the research.  The defendant created the false e-mail herself using a fictitious e-mail account she created in the name of this alleged friend.“We cannot allow health care professionals to feed their own addictions by diverting critical pain medications from patients,” said Acting United States Attorney Matt Kirsch.  “Thanks to the hard work of our office, the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, and the DEA, the theft of medications from suffering patients in these cases has been stopped.”“The FDA oversees the U.S. drug supply to ensure that it is safe and effective, and those health care professionals who fraudulently obtain needed medicines from patients put those patients’ health at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L. Grinstead, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Kansas City Field Office. “Today’s announcement should serve as a reminder that such conduct will not be tolerated.”“The DEA applauds the efforts of our Diversion Investigators that investigated this alongside the FDA and USAO,” said DEA Denver Field Division Special Agent in Charge Deanne Reuter. “We want it to be known that healthcare professionals who take advantage of patients in need by stealing their medications will be held accountable to the law.”On August 27, 2021, U.S. District Judge Raymond Moore sentenced Ms. Muhls to three months of probation. The government agreed to recommend a probationary sentence in consideration of the defendant’s confession and her cooperation in disclosing full information on her diversion, which is a matter potentially affecting the public health and the integrity of the health care system. The felony offense is punishable by up to four years of imprisonment and a fine of $250,000, per count.  The case number is  20-cr-00380-RM.On August 26, 2021, Ms. Nickel-Tangemen pleaded guilty before U.S. District Court Judge Christine M. Arguello.  Ms. Nickel-Tangemen will be sentenced on November 30, 2021.  The case number is 21-cr-00214-CMA.The investigations in these cases were conducted by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, and the Drug Enforcement Agency.Assistant United States Attorney Anna Edgar is prosecuting both of these matters.CASE NUMBERS:  21-cr-00214-CMA, 20-cr-00380-RM# # #Visit our website http://www.justice.gov/usao/co | Follow us on Twitter @DCoNewsTopic(s):OpioidsPrescription DrugsComponent(s):USAO - Colorado"

Three of the four individuals charged were arrested today. The fourth defendant has not yet been arrested and is a fugitive on separate federal charges.According to court documents, Ahmad “Andy” Khawaja, 49, of Los Angeles, California, and Thomas Wells, 74, of Martin County, Florida, are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Mohammad “Moe” Diab, 45, of Glendale, California, and Amy Ringler Rountree, 38, of Logan, Utah, are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Federal agents arrested Diab, Rountree, and Wells this morning. They are expected to appear in federal court in Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Utah, and Chicago, Illinois, respectively, later today or tomorrow. Khawaja is a fugitive from a December 2019 federal indictment filed in the District of Columbia that charges him, Diab, and others with campaign finance violations and obstruction of justice.According to the indictment, executives of Allied Wallet Inc., a payment processing company headquartered in Los Angeles, secured payment processing for high-risk businesses through fraudulent misrepresentations about merchant clients. Khawaja served as Allied Wallet’s owner and Chief Executive Officer, Diab served as the Chief Operating Officer, and Rountree served as Vice President of Operations. Allied Wallet provided services enabling merchant clients to accept debit and credit card payments over global electronic payment networks run by card brands such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. Allied Wallet served as an intermediary between its merchant clients and financial institution members of the card brand networks. Wells, through his company Priority Payout, introduced merchant clients seeking payment processing to Allied Wallet.The indictment alleges that Khawaja, Diab, Rountree, Wells, and others engaged in a scheme to defraud several financial institutions, the card brands, and others of money and property by fraudulently inducing them to provide payment processing services to merchants engaged in prohibited or high risk transactions, and to merchants that were terminated for fraud, chargeback, or other compliance concerns, through knowingly misrepresenting the types of transactions that the merchants were processing and the true identities of the merchants. The defendants and their co-conspirators accomplished the scheme through, among other steps, creating shell companies, designing fake websites that purported to sell low-risk retail and home goods, and using industry-standard codes that miscategorized the true nature of the transactions. Through the scheme, the defendants and their co-conspirators fraudulently obtained more than $150 million in payment card processing through more than 100 sham merchants.Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Nathaniel R.

From his residence in Florida, Burdick used a pill press to manufacture pills that he stamped with the letters ‘Xanax.’ The pills that Burdick created did not contain just alprazolam, which genuine Xanax contains, but also contained substances such as flualprazolam, etizolam, adinazolam, and microcrystalline cellulose.“The FBI works every day with our law enforcement partners to stop the sale of illegal drugs on the Dark Web. These drugs are not only illegal but can be extremely dangerous because these drug dealers are not selling the drugs they claim to be.

Bornstein of the FBI Washington Field Office Criminal Division. “The FBI Washington Field Office’s Hi-Tech Opioid Task Force is charged with identifying and investigating the most egregious Dark Web marketplaces, and the vendors operating on the marketplaces who are engaged in the illegal acquisition and distribution of controlled substances, to include fentanyl, methamphetamine, and other opioids.”“Selling counterfeit prescription drugs in the U.S. marketplace puts consumers’ health at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S.

We remain committed to keeping the mail safe for our customers and our employees.”Between June 2019 and August 2020, undercover federal agents purchased multiple packages of counterfeit pills from Burdick. When his home was searched pursuant to a federal search warrant in October 2020, agents recovered 16,000 counterfeit pills, a pill press, and almost $150,000 in cash. Law enforcement also discovered six firearms and miscellaneous ammunition in Burdick’s residence.Raj Parekh, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia; Robert E.

Mendell. “She caused a patient in her care to suffer needlessly, and she put lives at serious risk by working while under the influence of narcotics. Health care professionals who do such things warrant federal prosecution.”“Patients must have confidence in their health care provider that they are receiving appropriate medical care,” said Jeffrey Ebersole, Special Agent in Charge of the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, New York Field Office. “We are committed to working with our law enforcement partners to protect the public health and bring to justice those who tamper with medications and deny patients access to the treatments they need.”“Residents of Massachusetts depend on our state’s medical professionals to offer the highest level of care,” said Department of Public Health Acting Commissioner Margret Cooke. “DPH is committed to ensuring that our residents are receiving the best quality care at all congregate care facilities in the Commonwealth, and it is essential that we continue to hold accountable those who neglect this duty of care.”On Jan. 27, 2018, Works tampered with a bottle of morphine prescribed to a patient at Governor’s Center, a nursing facility in Westfield, by removing the morphine from the bottle and diluting the remaining morphine with another substance. The morphine was prescribed to a hospice patient, who subsequently received diluted doses of the medication shortly before her death. After ingesting the morphine, Works was observed to be significantly impaired while providing care to patients at the nursing facility.Acting U.S. Attorney Mendell; FDA SAC Ebersole; and Acting Commissioner Margret R. Cooke of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health made the announcement today.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of VermontFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, August 13, 2021The United States Attorney’s Office announced that today William Stenger, 72, of Newport, Vermont, pleaded guilty before Chief Judge Geoffrey W. Crawford in United States District Court in Burlington to a felony count of knowingly and willfully submitting false documents to the Vermont Regional Center (“VRC”) in connection with his involvement in the Jay Peak Biomedical Research Park EB-5 investment project, also called the AnC Vermont project.Stenger pleaded guilty to using false documents in a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency, namely United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which oversaw the EB-5 program.  According to court records and proceedings, the AnC Vermont project was designed to raise $110 million from 220 immigrant investors in order to construct and operate a biotechnology facility in Newport, Vermont.  EB-5 immigrant investors could qualify for permanent resident status (commonly known as a green card) by investing $500,000 in a commercial enterprise approved by the VRC, which had the authority to approve and monitor EB-5 projects in Vermont, and by USCIS.  In order to obtain a green card, each investor needed to demonstrate to USCIS that his or her investment had created, or would create within a few years, ten jobs.  So, for the AnC Vermont project, it was necessary to demonstrate a plan to create at least 2,200 jobs in a short time frame in order to obtain USCIS approval.As described during today’s hearing, according to materials provided to investors, to the VRC, and to USCIS, the AnC Vermont project would include three lines of business:  clean room rentals, sales of stem cell products, and sales of artificial organs.  The financial projections for the project forecasted that the three lines of business would generate over $40 million in revenue within three years, and would generate over $300 million in revenue in six years.  These financial projections impacted both the potential that investors would have their investments repaid, and the predicted number of jobs that the project would create.In the end of June 2014, Stenger agreed with the VRC to suspend offering and marketing the AnC Vermont project due to the VRC’s concerns about a number of aspects of the project.  Stenger understood that, in order to be permitted to market the AnC Vermont project again, he needed to provide answers to questions the VRC had asked about the financial projections and about the status of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approvals needed for commercialization of the products.  Stenger made a number of submissions to the VRC in an effort to convince the VRC to allow continued marketing of the AnC Vermont project, including a submission on January 9, 2015.  The January 2015 submission addressed, among other things, the AnC Vermont financial projections and the timeline for commercialization of the products.As to the financial projections, during the plea hearing Stenger admitted that he engaged a third-party consulting firm in October 2014 and asked the consulting firm to conduct a market demand study to analyze the potential market size of the AnC Vermont products and services, if the products and services were developed and FDA approved.  Throughout the rest of 2014, the consulting firm, which spent many hours working on the market demand analysis and had regular update meetings with Stenger and his team, was never asked to review, analyze, or opine on the project’s financial projections.  Instead, the process of working with the consulting firm made clear to Stenger that the AnC Vermont project had no stem cell products, and that the artificial organs either did not exist yet or required updating.  In the waning days of December 2014 and beginning of January 2015, Stenger asked the consulting firm’s project lead to write a letter stating that the AnC Vermont project’s business projections were reasonable.  Although the consulting firm had not assessed the project’s financial projections, the project lead ultimately signed a letter that falsely asserted that, based upon the consulting firm’s market analysis, the financial projections in the AnC Vermont business plan appeared reasonable.  Stenger knew that the consulting firm had not analyzed the financial projections.  Nonetheless, Stenger provided the letter to the VRC as part of the January 9, 2015 package of materials in support of reopening project fundraising.As to the product commercialization timeline, during today’s hearing Stenger admitted that he knew that each of the three lines of business—clean room rentals, sales of stem cells, and sales of artificial organs—required approvals from the FDA in order to generate revenue.  Stenger also knew that the FDA approval process was potentially a lengthy one, that obtaining FDA approval would require assistance from someone with regulatory expertise, and that no one associated with the AnC Vermont project had communicated with the FDA about any of the AnC Vermont business line ideas since Stenger exchanged letters with the FDA about one of the artificial organs in 2011.  As part of Stenger’s effort to convince the VRC to allow continued marketing of the AnC Vermont project, Stenger caused to be modified a commercialization timeline that he had previously received from co-defendant Alex Choi.  The timeline listed various steps required in order to commercialize the stem cell therapies and artificial organs referenced in the business plan, along with how long each step was expected to take.  In modifying Choi’s timeline, Stenger had the initial year changed from 2012 to 2015, reflecting the delays in the project’s development.  He also had four prominent red boxes, which contained text that read “Need to consult with FDA or experts in FDA’s regulation,” removed from the timeline.  As modified, the timeline downplayed uncertainty and lack of progress on FDA approvals, supporting the narrative that the AnC products would become profitable and create jobs in a short time.  Stenger submitted this modified timeline to VRC as part of the January 9, 2015 set of materials.  In the same submission, Stenger represented to the VRC that he had engaged FDA consultants to assist with the FDA process.  Stenger had the red caveats removed from the timeline without receiving any information from the consultants that might provide further support for the timeline, and without asking the consultants to start any work on the AnC Vermont project.  From 2012 to 2016, approximately 169 investors invested approximately $85 million in the AnC Vermont project, in addition to paying approximately $8 million in “administrative fees.”  Fundraising was never completed, and the AnC Vermont facility was never constructed.  Court records show that over $47 million of AnC Vermont investor funds were paid to Jay Construction Management, a Quiros-controlled company, and almost all of those $47 million were used for purposes unrelated to the AnC Vermont project.Stenger faces up to five years in prison and three years of supervised release for his knowing and willful submission of false documents to the VRC.  For sentencing, as stated in the plea agreement, the government will offer evidence about Stenger’s broader involvement in the fraud scheme as alleged in other counts of the indictment.  The Court will determine the sentence with reference to the federal sentencing guidelines.  The government has agreed that it will not recommend a fine or forfeiture, but instead will focus on seeking a restitution order for victims.Co-defendant Ariel Quiros pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering, and concealment charges in August 2020 and currently awaits sentencing.  Co-defendant William Kelly pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy and concealment charges in July 2021.  Both Quiros and Kelly have agreed to cooperate in the government’s ongoing matters.  Co-defendant Choi remains at large.Jonathan A. Ophardt, Acting United States Attorney, expresses his gratitude for the outstanding investigation assistance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the IRS Criminal Investigation, the Food and Drug Administration, and for the assistance of the Justice Department’s Fraud Section and Office of International Affairs.  The prosecutors handling the case are Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nicole Cate and Paul Van de Graaf.  William Stenger is represented by Brooks McArthur, Esq. and David Williams, Esq.  Ariel Quiros is represented by Neil Taylor, Esq. and Robert Katims, Esq.  William Kelly is represented by Robert Goldstein, Esq. and Mary Kehoe, Esq.Topic(s):Securities, Commodities, & Investment FraudImmigrationComponent(s):USAO - VermontFDA OCI, William Stenger, Newport VT, submit, false documents, FDA approval, Vermont Regional Center, VRC, Jay Peak Biomedical Research Park, EB-5, investment project, AnC Vermont, biotechnology, facility, stem cell, artificial organs, timeline,"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeWestern District of LouisianaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, August 12, 2021SHREVEPORT, La. –William Earl Maddox, 73, of Haynesville, Louisiana, the Constable of Claiborne Parish, Louisiana, pleaded guilty today before United States District Judge Elizabeth E. Foote to misbranding an illegal supplement, Acting United States Attorney Alexander C. Van Hook announced.Maddox was charged in a superseding indictment in September 2020 with selling and misbranding illegal supplements online and in stores. At today’s hearing, he pleaded guilty to a felony charge of misbranding of a drug while held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce. In connection with his guilty plea, Maddox agreed to a forfeiture judgment not to exceed $50,000 to the United States and agreed to sell real property in Homer, Louisiana to satisfy that judgment.According to information presented at the hearing, Maddox formed Middle Marketing, LLC in 2011. Shortly thereafter, he began operating two websites,www.sexassurance.comandwww.middlemarketing.com, wherein he advertised for sale capsules called “Sex Assurance.” Maddox described the capsules on his websites as a “natural male enhancement solution.”In 2017, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection intercepted a package that was shipped from Hong Kong and addressed to Maddox at his residence in Homer, Louisiana. The parcel was inspected and found to contain 2,000 unlabeled blister-packaged green capsules. The parcel was then referred to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA sent two letters to Maddox advising that the parcel had been detained for non-compliance with the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and advising him of his right to respond regarding the admissibility of the capsules. Maddox did not respond to either letter, and so the capsules were surrendered.In January 2018, FDA agents conducted a controlled purchase of two packs of Sex Assurance from Maddox’s website. An online receipt was issued that identified Middle Marketing as the seller and provided the email address and phone number associated with Maddox. A few days later, agents received a package shipped from Haynesville, Louisiana, that contained a business card in the name of “William Maddox” along with the two packs of Sex Assurance that were ordered. Both packs of Sex Assurance were labeled “100% natural herbs.” The Sex Assurance capsules were submitted to the crime lab for analysis and tested positive for sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra. The packs did not list sildenafil as an ingredient of the product, nor did it list any identifying information of the manufacturer, packer or distributor.In March 2019, agents executed a search warrant at Maddox’s residence. Agents found thousands of green blister-pack capsules, Sex Assurance labels, packaged Sex Assurance capsules, a computer, and other items to suggest Maddox packaged the product from his home. Maddox is not a licensed practitioner, nor has he ever registered with the Secretary of Health and Human Services to manufacture and distribute drugs as required by 21 U.S.C. § 360.“The regulations put in place by the FDA are to be taken seriously. When individuals decide to purchase medications from outside of the United States and sell to unknowing victims, it could result in serious complications,” stated Acting United States Attorney Alexander C. Van Hook. “Cases such as these will continue to be brought against those who choose to abuse these regulations.”\"Misbranded prescription drugs that are disguised as dietary supplements and smuggled from overseas can present a serious health risk to those who buy and use them,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin C. Fielder, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Miami Field Office. “The drugs often contain undisclosed active pharmaceutical ingredients and are made under unknown conditions. We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who attempt to traffic in misbranded prescription drugs.”The defendant, William Earl Maddox, faces a sentence of not more than three years in prison, a fine of $250,000, or both. Sentencing has been set for December 10, 2021.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jessica D.

Martinez of the Southern District of Florida sentenced Eduardo Navarro, 52, of Miami, to 46 months in prison, and Nayade Varona, 50, of Port St. Lucie, to 30 months in prison. The court also ordered the defendants to pay $2,134,503 in restitution. According to court documents, Navarro and Varona worked at a clinical research site called Tellus Clinical Research (Tellus). Navarro, a nurse practitioner, was a sub-investigator at Tellus, and Varona was an assistant study coordinator. As part of their plea agreements, Navarro and Varona admitted that they conspired with others to falsify data in connection with two clinical trials by, among other things, fabricating medical records to make it appear as though subjects were participating in the clinical trials when, in truth, they were not.“By falsifying clinical trial data, the defendants undermined a crucial component of the drug approval process,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian M.

Rather than pay full price to drug manufacturers for HIV, cancer, and other expensive medications, Joles bought his wholesale supply at a discount from co-conspirators who obtained the drugs on the streets, from black market sellers. While the drugs were branded medications, produced by the original pharmaceutical developers, they had been diverted from legitimate, secure supply chains to the black market through health care fraud and other illegal means. Once purchased from the black-market sellers, the co-conspirators re-packaged the drugs and sold them to Joles, complete with fabricated documentation to disguise the drugs’ origins. Joles knew he was buying illegally diverted drugs that were not from legitimate suppliers. Nevertheless, he sold the diverted drugs to unwitting retail pharmacies and consumers at big mark-ups. During the conspiracy, which lasted from 2014 to 2019, $78 million in illegal proceeds was laundered through shell company bank account operated by Joles’ co-conspirators.On May 27, Joles pled guilty to one count of conspiring to traffic in medical products with false documentation and one count of conspiring to launder money.Joles is one of nine defendants originally charged in case no. 19-cr-20674, seven of whom have pled guilty and been sentenced. There are five more defendants facing charges in a second superseding indictment, and one fugitive. The charges against these five defendants are mere allegations.

        "content": "City of London Police leads crackdown on international importation and distribution of illegal pharmaceutical drugs23/07/2021The City of London Police’s Serious Organised Crime Team executed a series of warrants at several addresses last week as part of an investigation into the illegal importation and distribution of unregulated pharmaceutical drugs from India into the UK.Officers from the unit attended six premises in North West London and Slough on Tuesday 13 July 2021, resulting in four arrests, as well as the seizure of approximately 1,200 kilograms of Class C pharmaceutical drugs and £60,000 cash.The ongoing investigation centres around the distribution of unapproved and counterfeit prescription drugs into the US. The drugs are believed to have been produced in India and then illegally imported into the UK, where they are stored and then bulk-shipped to the US. The international scale of this case has resulted in a joint investigation led by City of London Police with the support of the United States Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA OCI), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the United Kingdom Border Agency (UKBA) and HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).Detective Inspector Anne Medlycott, from the City of London Police’s Serious Organised Crime Team, said:“We believe that these pharmaceutical drugs are being mass-produced in India and imported to the UK for onward international distribution, resulting in significant financial gain for those involved. The drugs are unregulated, meaning that the contents’ purity and ingredients are unknown.“Our number one priority is public safety. By taking such a large quantity of drugs off the streets, we hope to protect people from the dangers these unapproved pharmaceutical drugs could pose.”Three storage containers and three residential properties were targeted during the operation, which saw the following arrests on suspicion of conspiracy to supply drugs and money laundering:a 48-year-old man from Slough;a 28-year-old woman from Brent, London;a 31-year-old man from Brent, London; anda 31-year-old man from Brent, London.The arrested suspects have been released under investigation until Friday 6 August 2021.The shipping container was loaded with boxes of pharmaceutical drugs, which have been found to be a mix of benzodiazepines and opioids used for the treatment of insomnia, severe pain, anxiety and seizures. The drugs were concealed under clothing and large cakes, and mixed in with sundries.Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations Cathy Hermsen from Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA OCI), said:“We are pleased to join our law enforcement partners in helping break the international supply chain of illicit prescription drugs and thus protect the public’s health.”Homeland Security Investigations London Attaché, Eric Feldman, said:“HSI is proud of our federal and international partnerships. Through constant cooperation and information sharing between our agencies, we were able to keep 1200 kg of illicit, unregulated prescription drugs out of the hands of criminals and off our streets.”"

The defendant was resentenced after the First Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed his criminal convictions but vacated his sentence and forfeiture order.Glenn Chin, 53, previously of Canton, was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Richard G. Stearns to 126 months in prison and three years of supervised release. Chin was also ordered to pay forfeiture of approximately $473,584 and restitution of $82 million.Chin was sentenced in January 2018 to eight years in prison, two years of supervised release and ordered to pay forfeiture of $175,000 and restitution in an amount to be determined. In October 2017, Chin was convicted by a federal jury of all 77 counts, including racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud and mislead.On July 7, 2021, co-defendant Barry Cadden, a former owner of NECC, was resentenced by Judge Stearns to 174 months in prison and ordered to pay forfeiture of $1.4 million and restitution of $82 million. Cadden was previously sentenced in June 2017 by Judge Stearns to nine years in prison and three years of supervised release after being convicted by a federal jury in March 2017 of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud and mislead.In 2017, the government appealed the defendants’ sentences. In July 2020, the First Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the defendants’ sentences, finding that the Court failed to impose applicable sentencing enhancements and erred in its forfeiture rulings. Significantly, the First Circuit held that the patients who were injected with NECC’s contaminated preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) may be considered victims of the fraud. According to court documents, more than 100 patients died and approximately 800 patients were sickened as a result of contaminated MPA injections. As a result of the First Circuit’s decision, the defendants’ convictions were affirmed, and their sentences and forfeiture orders were vacated and remanded to the District Court for re-sentencing.In 2012, 753 patients in 20 states were diagnosed with a fungal infection after receiving injections of MPA manufactured by NECC, and more than 100 patients died as a result. The outbreak was the largest public health crisis ever caused by a contaminated pharmaceutical drug.Chin manufactured and oversaw the manufacturing of contaminated MPA. In doing so, Chin ignored pharmacy regulations and NECC’s own drug formulation worksheets and standard operating procedures. Specifically, he improperly sterilized the MPA, failed to verify the sterilization process and improperly tested it to ensure sterility. Despite knowing these deficiencies, Chin directed the MPA to be filled into tens of thousands of vials and shipped to NECC customers nationwide. During the fungal meningitis outbreak, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control identified 18 different types of fungi from MPA vials and patient samples.Chin directed the shipping of drugs prior to receiving test results confirming their sterility, and he directed NECC staff to mislabel drugs to conceal this practice. He also directed the compounding of drugs with expired ingredients, including chemotherapy drugs that had expired several years prior. Chin prioritized drug production over cleaning, directed the forging of cleaning logs and routinely ignored mold and bacteria found inside the clean rooms.Acting United States Attorney Nathaniel R.

Pharmacywalmart.com purports to offer for sale a number of drugs, including Stromectol (Ivermectin), Aralen (Chloroquine) and Kaletra (Lopinavir and Ritonavir), for the experimental and unapproved treatment or prevention of COVID-19.As detailed in the affidavit filed in support of the seizure, Stromectol is the brand name of Ivermectin which is a prescription medication used to treat certain parasitic infections; Aralen is a brand name for chloroquine, most commonly used for the treatment and prevention of malaria; and Kaletra is the brand name of a combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir which are prescription medications that are approved to treat human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). None of those drugs are an approved preventative or treatment for COVID-19.  On the page offering Kaletra for sale, the subject domain name contained the following: “In 2020, after laboratory researches, it was found out that Kaletra shows positive results in a blockage of a COVID-19 viral replication.” The affidavit alleges that this statement is not supported by trials or the FDA.Neither domain name is authorized by Walmart to use their intellectual property or offer their products for sale.  By seizing the sites, the government has prevented third parties from acquiring the names and using it to commit additional crimes, as well as prevented third parties from continuing to access the sites in their present form.On May 17, 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The Task Force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeMiddle District of PennsylvaniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASETuesday, July 20, 2021HARRISBURG - The United States Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania announced that Jonathan Clark Baird, age 45, of Louisville, Kentucky, was sentenced on July 19, 2021, to one year of probation by Chief United States District Court Judge John E. Jones, III, for conspiracy to defraud the Food and Drug Administration.According to Acting United States Attorney Bruce D. Brandler, Baird was an attorney licensed to practice law in the Commonwealth of Kentucky focusing on steroid and nutritional supplements law. Baird conspired with two Internet-based businesses, Total Trading LLC and L and P, LLC, from December 2011 to on or about December 2014, to defraud the United States. In particular, Baird agreed to use his knowledge of steroid laws, nutritional supplement laws and the FDA’s regulatory and enforcement practices to instruct these companies on the methods to use to interfere and obstruct the United States Food and Drug Administration enforcement and regulatory oversight, including instructing his co-conspirators on the steps to be taken to fraudulently conceal the true nature of their illegal sale of prescription drugs from the FDA.Baird’s coconspirators, Paul Leix and co-defendant, Dominic Pileggi, were involved in a business, L&P Trading, which used the internet to market and distribute peptides (a type of amino acid), along with other bodybuilding chemicals, to individuals seeking to enhance their physiques. Leix and Pileggi marketed these products on their website while providing a disclaimer that the substances were not for human consumption and use (for research purposes only). Customers who visited the website seeking these products for bodybuilding purposes would falsely attest that they were buying the chemicals for research purposes. By marketing the products to the online bodybuilding community, Leix and Pileggi knew that purchasers would use the products for personal consumption rather than research. The “research only” disclaimer was a ruse to circumvent the regulatory authority of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). L&P Trading advertised on body-building billboards and sites and Leix and Pileggi were not properly licensed or had the required approvals to manufacture, sell or prescribe these products.  Leix and Pileggi also sold these drugs and their chemical components to other illegal distributors and manufacturers, including Total Trading, LLC, a company owned and operated by co- conspirator Thomas Keightly, located in Lebanon County. Keightly, in turn, sold directly to end users in the same manner as Leix and Pileggi.Paul Leix was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment and Thomas Keightly was sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment for conspiracy to commit money laundering and delivery of altered or misbranded drugs by fraud. Pileggi was sentenced to time-served for conspiracy to commit money laundering and introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce.“Selling unapproved prescription drugs in the U.S. marketplace is illegal and puts consumers’ health at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office. “We remain fully committed to disrupting and dismantling illegal drug distribution networks that take steps to avoid FDA regulatory scrutiny at the expense of public health and safety.”The cases were investigated by the Food and Drug Administration and the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation.  Assistant United States Attorney Joseph Terz prosecuted the cases.# # #Component(s):USAO - Pennsylvania, Middle"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of UtahFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, July 16, 2021SALT LAKE CITY – All eight of the co-defendants in the case against Aaron Michael Shamo have been sentenced after a series of sentencing hearings took place this week in a Utah federal court. Seven co-defendants were sentenced throughout the week, including Jonathon “Luke” Paz, Drew Wilson Crandall, Alexandrya Marie Tonge, Katherine Lauren Anne Bustin, Mario Anthony Noble, Sean Michael Gygi, and Ana “Gabby” Noriega, while Christopher Sean Kenny was sentenced last month in a separate hearing. All defendants previously plead guilty to charges related to their involvement in Shamo’s multi-million dollar nationwide dark net drug trafficking organization that distributed more than a half million counterfeit pills throughout the country.During a trial in federal court in August of 2019, a jury found Shamo guilty of organizing and directing a drug trafficking organization that imported fentanyl and alprazolam from China and used the drugs to manufacture fake oxycodone pills made with fentanyl and counterfeit Xanax tablets. The evidence at trial showed that more than 90 of Shamo’s customers died of drug overdoses. However, the total number of victims could not be calculated since Shamo sold many of his fentanyl laced fake oxycodone pills in bulk to redistributors and their customers could not always be located by investigators. Shamo was sentenced to life in prison by U.S. District Court Judge Dale A. Kimball in October of 2020.The sentences handed down in federal court for Shamo’s co-defendants are as follows:Jonathon “Luke” Paz, 33, now of Fort Walton Beach, Florida, was sentenced to 60 months in federal prison for his role in helping to run the dark web drug distribution empire founded by Aaron Shamo. Paz was convicted of conspiracy to manufacture a controlled substance containing fentanyl, two counts of knowingly adulterating drugs while holding them for sale, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. In the plea agreement, Paz admitted to operating pill presses for Aaron Shamo and pressing counterfeit Xanax containing alprazolam and counterfeit oxycodone pills containing fentanyl. Paz admitted that he developed the process and recipe to create the counterfeit fentanyl-laced oxycodone pills, and that he pressed almost 500,000 of these counterfeit pills. Paz turned over $800,000 in U.S. currency and 32.8 bitcoins to federal investigators upon his arrest that were proceeds from his involvement in the drug distribution with Shamo.Drew Wilson Crandall, 35, of Draper, was sentenced to 54 months in federal prison for his role in helping to run the dark web drug distribution empire founded by Aaron Shamo. Crandall was convicted of conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, conspiracy to distribute alprazolam, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. In the plea agreement, Crandall admitted that he and Aaron Shamo imported and distributed controlled substances in Utah and around the country using the Pharma-Master dark web site developed by Shamo. Crandall also admitted that he helped Shamo mix the illegal narcotics in mason jars and used pill presses to turn the mixture into pill form. After having his own misgivings about the scheme, Crandall sold his stake in the company to Shamo for $40,000 and moved to New Zealand in November of 2015, but was later lured back into the scheme by Shamo and continued to work in customer service and handled complaints and inquiries from Shamo’s customers. Crandall was arrested in 2017 by federal law enforcement when he returned to Hawaii to get married to his fiancé.Alexandrya Marie Tonge 29, of South Jordan, was sentenced to 36 months in federal prison for her role in Shamo’s drug trafficking network. Tonge was convicted of conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, conspiracy to distribute alprazolam, possession of fentanyl with the intent to distribute, using the U.S. mail to commit drug trafficking, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. In the plea agreement, Tonge admitted to being paid to ship and receive packages containing illegal narcotics on behalf of Aaron Shamo and Drew Crandall, and to using their bitcoin wallets to pay for expenses related to the drug trafficking organization.Katherine Lauren Anne Bustin, 31, of South Jordan, was sentenced to 36 months in federal prison for her role in Shamo’s dark web drug trafficking network. Bustin was convicted of conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, conspiracy to distribute alprazolam, possession of fentanyl with the intent to distribute, using the U.S. mail to commit drug trafficking, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. In the plea agreement, Ms. Tonge admitted to being paid to ship and receive packages containing illegal narcotics on behalf of Aaron Shamo and Drew Crandall, and to using their bitcoin wallets to pay for expenses related to the drug trafficking organization. Bustin also admitted that Shamo paid her and Tonge $7,000 per month to package thousands of shipments of narcotics to Shamo’s customers, including placing the correct number of pills in the customers’ orders and writing false return addresses on the packages.Mario Anthony Noble, 32, of Midvale, was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison for his role in Shamo’s dark web drug trafficking network. Noble was convicted of conspiracy to distribute fentanyl and conspiracy to distribute alprazolam. In his plea agreement, Noble admitted to being recruited by Shamo to be the “backbone” of Shamo’s dark web store and to manage customer service along with processing orders of various controlled substances. These controlled substances included alprazolam tablets and pills marked like oxycodone, but which contained fentanyl. Noble admitted that when he worked for Shamo, part of his daily duties included pulling together a list of customers, their mailing addresses, and the types and quantities of drugs they ordered. Once he created these lists, he would send them in an encrypted form, through an email account Aaron Shamo created, to co-conspirators who were responsible for packaging the orders and affixing mailing labels and postage. Noble admitted that he processed thousands of tablets containing alprazolam and pills containing fentanyl.Sean Michael Gygi, 31 of Midvale, was sentenced to 24 months in federal prison for his role in Shamo’s dark web drug trafficking network. Gygi was convicted of conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, conspiracy to distribute alprazolam, importing fentanyl into the United States, and using the U.S. mail to commit drug trafficking. In his plea agreement, Gygi admitted to accepting shipments of illegal narcotics from China at his home on behalf of Aaron Shamo. Gygi also admitted that he also served as a runner for Shamo and picked up packages from co-defendants Tonge and Bustin five nights a week and delivered them to multiple post offices around the Salt Lake Valley to avoid detection.Ana “Gabby” Noriega, 30, of West Jordan, was sentenced to 36 months of probation for her role in assisting Aaron Shamo’s drug trafficking operation. Noriega was convicted of conspiracy to commit money laundering, and in her plea agreement, admitted to working for Shamo for six months in 2016 in a role that was equivalent to an Executive Assistant. Noriega admitted that she bought supplies and other items for Shamo to use in furtherance of his drug trafficking operation and that she used money to purchase items that she knew was obtained from the sale of illegal narcotics.Christopher Sean Kenny, 46, of Midvale, was sentenced to 120 months of imprisonment in June of 2021. Kenny was convicted of conspiracy to distribute fentanyl and engaging in money laundering. In the plea agreement, Kenny admitted that he worked as a middleman for Aaron Shamo and helped Shamo sale fentanyl laced oxycodone pills to other drug dealers in Utah, who would then sell Shamo’s pills to their customers. Kenny admitted that he was paid approximately one dollar per pill for this service and that he distributed approximately 140,000 pills. Kenny then bought a Ford F150 in August of 2016 using cash that he obtained from selling narcotics for Shamo.“Aaron Shamo’s life sentence, and the sentences imposed on his co-defendants, send a clear message to anyone involved in the distribution of illegal narcotics. Law enforcement will catch you, and you will be punished for your role in the death and destruction that you cause in our communities,” said Acting United States Attorney Andrea Martinez. “As the opioid epidemic continues to take its destructive toll, we will remain vigilant and continue to aggressively prosecute those who violate the controlled substance laws of the United States. I send my deepest condolences to the families of our victims. We know you will never be made whole, but we hope that this will provide some measure of closure and allow you to heal.”“There is no way to overstate the deadly severity of the crimes these defendants committed. They assisted one of the most prolific opioid dealers this state has ever encountered, and they are complicit in the destructive and too often-fatal consequences that resulted,” said Utah Attorney General Sean D. Reyes. “Regardless of the length of their sentence, they must live with the fact that they profited from crimes that ruined countless lives.   I would like to express my sincere condolences to the families around the world who lost loved ones and whose lives were devasted by these crimes. I am grateful to the fine DEA agents and prosecutors of the DEA, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, and the Utah AG Office in this case. I also appreciate Judge Kimball’s careful handling and thoughtful decisions in this case.”“The amount of Fentanyl distributed throughout the U.S. as a result of the operations these criminals supported devastated communities throughout the country,” said Steven Cagen Special Agent in Charge, Homeland Security Investigations Denver. “We will continue to investigate those that put personal profits above the lives of people in their communities and bring deadly drugs into the U.S. for distribution. Justice was served and we’re gratified these co-conspirators will be behind bars for the foreseeable future.”“The dismantlement of this organization, which was responsible for multiple overdose related deaths, highlights the success of cooperative efforts between law enforcement agencies within the state of Utah,” said Michael J. Tinkler, Utah DEA Assistant Special Agent in Charge.“It’s another example of the strength of our partnerships and unified approach in confronting criminal organizations targeting our communities.”“The opioid crisis is still with us and continues to expand. Those who contribute to the breadth and depth of this crisis carry the burden of the devastation they impose on families and communities across the nation,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L. Grinstead, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Kansas City Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who facilitate illicit access to opioids.”“Mr. Shamo and his associates put at risk countless individuals addicted to opioids, through the sale of dangerous counterfeit fentanyl laced pills. This drug empire affected the entire nation, and today marks a final step in justice for those who caused this great tragedy for so many,” said IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge, Albert Childress. “We will continue to work together with our law-enforcement partners to dismantle criminal enterprises like this, who intend to financially profit from the exploitation and suffering of the American people.”“Battling and keeping illegal narcotics - especially synthetic opioids - out of the U.S. Mail is one of the highest priorities of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service,” said Utah Postal Inspection Service Team Leader Jared Bingham. “In today’s world of Dark Web and cyber crimes, drug dealers don’t always fit the stereotypical image of years past where the danger and effect of their crimes was confined to local jurisdictions. The Dark Web allowed the defendants in this case to operate their criminal organization from the safety and comfort of their own homes. However, the danger and lethal effects of their drug dealing enterprise was not limited to individual cities and towns. Rather, it touched virtually every corner of our nation, and it’s wake of death and pain is just as wide. In cases like this, it is important that justice not only be served, but that it send the right message to would be Dark Web criminals. The Postal Inspection Service is grateful to the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our federal law enforcement partners for their diligence in investigating and prosecuting this important case.”Assistant U.S. Attorneys and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney’s from the Utah Attorney General’s Office prosecuted the cases. Special Agents from the DEA’s Metro Narcotics Task Force, Homeland Security Investigations, IRS Criminal Investigations, Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, and Inspectors from the United States Postal Inspection Service conducted the investigation.Topic(s):Drug TraffickingComponent(s):USAO - Utah"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, July 16, 2021SAN DIEGO – Jennings Ryan Staley, a physician who attempted to profit from the pandemic by marketing a “miracle cure” for COVID-19, pleaded guilty in federal court today, admitting that he tried to smuggle hydroxychloroquine into the United States to sell in his coronavirus “treatment kits.”Staley, the former operator of Skinny Beach Med Spas in and around San Diego, also admitted in his plea agreement that he abused his position of trust as a physician in making the extreme claims, and that he lied to the FBI when confronted about it.The doctor pleaded guilty to one count of importation contrary to law, admitting that he worked with a Chinese supplier to try to smuggle into the United States a barrel that he believed contained over 26 pounds of hydroxychloroquine powder by mislabeling it as “yam extract.”  Staley admitted that he intended to sell the hydroxychloroquine powder in capsules as part of his 2020 business venture selling the COVID-19 “treatment kits.”In his plea agreement, Staley also admitted that he wrote a prescription for hydroxychloroquine for one of his employees and then misused the employee’s name and personal identifying information and answered questions as though he were the employee to fill the prescription, all without the employee’s knowledge or consent. Staley agreed that he engaged in this conduct in order to obtain more of the drug for his enterprise.In late March and early April 2020, Staley marketed and sold his treatment kits to Skinny Beach customers.  According to the plea agreement, he described his products—which included hydroxychloroquine—as a “one hundred percent” cure, a “magic bullet,” an “amazing weapon,” and “almost too good to be true,” and stated that the products would provide at least six weeks of immunity. Staley admitted that these statements were material to his potential customers, and that as a doctor he abused a position of public trust. An undercover agent purchased six of Staley’s treatment packs for $4,000.Staley also admitted that he willfully impeded and sought to obstruct the federal investigation into his conduct by lying to federal agents.  Specifically, he falsely denied ever claiming that his treatment packages were a “one hundred percent effective cure,” adding “that would be foolish.”  Staley likewise falsely claimed that his medical practice would “absolutely” get all relevant information about each family member when sending out medications for a family treatment pack, when just a week earlier, he had dispensed a “family pack” of hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, generic Viagra, Xanax, and azithromycin to the undercover agent without collecting any medical information from the agent or his five supposed family members.“While healthcare workers around the world selflessly labored on the frontlines of an international pandemic, this doctor used his position of trust to cash in on COVID-19 fears,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Randy Grossman. “We are committed to protecting the American people from such scams and holding the scammers accountable.” Grossman commended the federal agents from FBI and FDA-OCI, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nicholas Pilchak and Jaclyn Stahl, who worked hard pursuing justice in this case.  He also commended U.S. Customs and Border Protection for its assistance with the investigation.“Dr. Staley offered a 'magic bullet' - a guaranteed cure for COVID-19 to people gripped in fear during a global pandemic,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Suzanne Turner. “Today, Dr. Staley admitted it was all a lie as part of a scam to make a quick buck. The FBI will continue to vigorously pursue doctors who abuse their professions to defraud innocent victims with gimmicks of false hope and promises.”“The FDA continues to work with its law enforcement partners to protect the public health by identifying, investigating and bringing to justice those who attempt to profit from the pandemic by offering and distributing COVID-19 treatments with unproven ‘miracle cure’ claims to American consumers,” said Special Agent in Charge Lisa L. Malinowski, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office.Staley’s next court date is October 8, 2021 before U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel.On May 17, 2021, Attorney General Merrick Garland established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force, led by the Deputy Attorney General, to bring together the full resources of the federal government to bolster fraud enforcement efforts.If you think you are a victim of COVID-19 fraud, immediately report it to the FBI (visit ic3.gov, tips.fbi.gov, or call 1-800-CALL-FBI or the San Diego FBI at 858-320-1800).

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, July 8, 2021St. Jude Medical Inc. (St. Jude) has agreed to pay $27 million to settle allegations under the False Claims Act that, between November 2014 and October 2016, it knowingly sold defective heart devices to health care facilities that, in turn, implanted the devices into patients insured by federal health care programs. St. Jude was acquired by Abbott Laboratories in January 2017.“To ensure the health and safety of patients, manufacturers of implantable cardiac devices must be transparent when communicating with the government about safety issues and incidents,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “We will hold accountable those companies whose conduct violates the law and puts patients’ health at risk.”“Medical device manufacturers have an obligation to be truthful with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the U.S. government will not pay for devices that are unsafe and risk injury or death,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Jonathan F. Lenzner for the District of Maryland. “The government contends that St. Jude knowingly caused the submission of false claims and failed to inform the FDA with critical information about prior injuries and a death which, had the FDA been made aware, would have led to a recall. The U.S. Attorney’s Office is committed to protecting Medicare and other federal health care programs from fraud, and in doing so strengthen patient safety.”The government alleges that St. Jude failed to disclose serious adverse health events in connection with the premature depletion of the battery in certain models of its Fortify, Fortify Assura, Quadra and Unify devices, which are implantable defibrillators used in patients at risk of cardiac arrest due to an irregular heartbeat. The devices are surgically implanted into patients’ chests, and when the devices detect an irregular heartbeat, they send an electrical pulse to the heart to “shock” it back to its normal rhythm. The government alleged that, by 2013, St. Jude knew that lithium clusters formed on the batteries of the devices, causing some of the batteries to short and, in turn, suffer a premature power drain.The government alleges that, in late 2014, St. Jude submitted a request to the FDA to approve a change to prevent lithium clusters from draining the battery and told the FDA, “no serious injury, permanent harm or deaths have been reported associated with this” issue. However, according to the government’s allegations, St. Jude was aware at that time of two reported serious injuries and one death associated with premature battery depletion (PBD) induced by lithium clusters.St. Jude continued to distribute devices that had been manufactured without the new design. In August 2016, St. Jude contacted the FDA and informed it that the number of PBD events had increased to 729, including two deaths and 29 events associated with loss of pacing. On Oct. 10, 2016, St. Jude issued a medical advisory regarding the PBD caused by lithium cluster shorts, which FDA classified as a Class I recall. A Class I recall is where there is a reasonable probability that “violative” products “will cause serious adverse health consequences, including death.” After the recall, St. Jude no longer sold the older devices, but thousands of them had been implanted into patients between Nov. 20, 2014, and Oct. 10, 2016.“Ensuring patient safety is our number one priority,” said Special Agent in Charge Maureen R. Dixon of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “HHS-OIG will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to investigate and hold accountable medical companies who put profits over people and ensure the integrity of the Medicare and Medicaid programs.”“The FDA regulates medical devices to assure that patient health is protected,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack of the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Metro Washington Field Office. “Reporting information untruthfully to the agency about the safety of medical devices jeopardizes patients’ health and safety. We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who place the public health at risk.”“The Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) and its law enforcement partners will aggressively investigate fraud that puts the health of our military members and their families at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Christopher W. Dillard of the DCIS Mid-Atlantic Field Office. “We hope this settlement sends a clear warning to medical corporations that choose profit over patient care.”“The OPM OIG prioritizes the health and safety of patients above all else,” said Norbert E. Vint, Deputy Inspector General Performing the Duties of the Inspector General of the Office of Personnel Management’s Office of Inspector General (OPM-OIG). “We are grateful for today’s settlement and applaud the hard work of our Department of Justice and law enforcement partners.”The civil settlement includes the resolution of claims brought under the qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act by Debbie Burke, a patient who received one of the devices that was subject to recall. The qui tam case is captioned United States ex rel. Debbie Burke v. St. Jude Medical, Inc., No. 16-cv-3611 (D. Md.).The resolution obtained in this matter was the result of a coordinated effort between the Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch, Fraud Section; the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland; the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General and Office of General Counsel; DCIS; OPM-OIG; and the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations and Office of Chief Counsel.This matter was handled by Trial Attorney Jonathan Gold of the Civil Division and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Thomas Corcoran and Jane Andersen of the District of Maryland.The claims resolved by the settlement are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability.Attachment(s):Download St. Jude Settlement.pdfTopic(s):False Claims ActComponent(s):Civil DivisionPress Release Number:21-634"

Nahid “Nina” Tormosi Shafa, 63, was indicted on one count of health care fraud conspiracy and one count of international money laundering conspiracy. The defendants were previously indicted in August 2020.According to the charging documents, Shafa was a psychiatrist who owned and operated Novel Psychopharmacology, for which Tormosi Shafa served as office manager. From April 2016 through January 2019, the defendants allegedly filed false and fraudulent Medicare reimbursement claims that they deposited into bank accounts they controlled.It is further alleged that from approximately January 2008 through January 2018, Shafa and Tormosi Shafa engaged in an international money laundering scheme to purchase naltrexone pellet implants as well as disulfiram pellet implants and injections from Hong Kong.

However, the forms that Shafa and Tormosi Shafa allegedly purchased are not approved by the FDA. Shafa allegedly falsified shipping documents to conceal that the packages containing the drugs were shipped from Hong Kong to Shafa in Massachusetts. For example, packages containing naltrexone pellet implants were falsely declared as ‘plastic beads in plastic tubes’ in shipping documents. Shafa and Tormosi Shafa offered to sell these drugs to patients of Novel.The charge of health care fraud conspiracy provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of MassachusettsFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, July 7, 2021Outbreak was the largest public health crisis ever caused by a contaminated pharmaceutical drugBOSTON – The former owner of the now-defunct New England Compounding Center (NECC) was resentenced today in federal court in Boston in connection with the 2012 nationwide fungal meningitis outbreak. The defendant was resentenced after the First Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed his criminal convictions but vacated his sentence and forfeiture order.Barry Cadden, 54, previously of Wrentham, was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Richard G. Stearns to 174 months in prison. Cadden was also ordered to pay forfeiture of $1.4 million and restitution of $82 million.Cadden was originally sentenced in June 2017 by Judge Stearns to nine years in prison, three years of supervised release and forfeiture in the amount of $7.5 million after being convicted by a federal jury in March 2017 of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud and mislead.Co-defendant Glenn Chin, NECC’s former supervisory pharmacist, is scheduled to be resentenced tomorrow by Judge Stearns. Chin was sentenced in January 2018 to eight years in prison, two years of supervised release and ordered to pay forfeiture of $175,000 and restitution in an amount to be determined. In October 2017, Chin was convicted by a federal jury of all 77 counts, including racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud and mislead.In 2017, the government appealed the defendants’ sentences. In July 2020, the First Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the defendants’ sentences, finding that the Court failed to impose applicable sentencing enhancements and erred in its forfeiture rulings. Significantly, the First Circuit held that the patients who were injected with NECC’s contaminated preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) may be considered victims of the fraud. According to court documents, more than 100 patients died and approximately 800 patients were sickened as a result of contaminated MPA injections. As a result of the First Circuit’s decision, the defendants’ convictions were affirmed, and their sentences and forfeiture orders were vacated and remanded to the District Court for resentencing.In 2012, 753 patients in 20 states were diagnosed with a fungal infection after receiving injections of MPA manufactured by NECC, and more than 100 patients died as a result. The outbreak was the largest public health crisis ever caused by a contaminated pharmaceutical drug.Cadden was responsible for directing and authorizing shipments of contaminated MPA to NECC customers nationwide. In addition, he authorized the shipping of drugs before test results confirming their sterility were returned, never notified customers of nonsterile results and compounded drugs with expired ingredients. Furthermore, certain batches of drugs were manufactured, in part, by an unlicensed pharmacy technician at NECC. Cadden also repeatedly took steps to shield NECC’s operations from regulatory oversight by the FDA by claiming to be a pharmacy dispensing drugs pursuant to valid, patient-specific prescriptions. In fact, NECC routinely dispensed drugs in bulk without valid prescriptions. NECC even used fictional and celebrity names on fake prescriptions to dispense drugs, such as “Michael Jackson,” “Freddie Mae” and “Diana Ross.”Acting United States Attorney Nathaniel R.

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, July 8, 2021Avanos Medical Inc. to Pay $22 Million to Resolve Criminal Charges Related to the Fraudulent Misbranding of Its Microcool Surgical GownsAvanos Medical Inc., a U.S.-based multinational medical device corporation, has agreed to pay more than $22 million to resolve a criminal charge relating to the company’s fraudulent misbranding of its MicroCool surgical gowns.A criminal information filed yesterday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas charges Avanos with one count of introducing misbranded surgical gowns into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud and mislead. According to court filings, Avanos falsely labeled the gowns as providing the highest level of protection against fluid and virus penetration. Under the terms of a deferred prosecution agreement filed with the criminal information, Avanos will pay $22,228,000, composed of a victim compensation payment of $8,939,000, a criminal monetary penalty in the amount of $12,600,000 and a disgorgement payment of $689,000. The deferred prosecution agreement resolves a criminal investigation into Avanos’s misbranding of its MicroCool surgical gowns under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the company’s obstruction of a 2016 for-cause inspection conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) into Avanos’s surgical gown business.“Companies that sell medical products put their customers at risk when they misrepresent the quality of those products,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department of Justice will work with its law enforcement partners to prosecute companies that put profits over safety, especially when they provide products meant to protect medical professionals in potentially high-risk situations involving infectious diseases.”“Customers of Avanos trusted the company to deliver on the promises it made about the safety of its surgical gowns,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Avanos betrayed that trust. This resolution emphasizes that the department will hold companies in the medical device industry accountable and shows the Criminal Division’s dedication to partnering with the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch to root out fraud.”“The last thing health care workers should have to worry about is whether their personal protective equipment lives up to manufacturers’ claims,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Prerak Shah for the Northern District of Texas. “Misbranded PPE can pose serious risks to medical professionals and patients alike. All companies that do business in Texas, health care or otherwise, will be held accountable for the promises they make about their products.”“Medical devices, such as surgical gowns, must have truthful and accurate labeling,” said Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations Catherine A. Hermsen of the FDA. “Surgical gowns with false or misleading labeling can put health care practitioners and patients at risk. The FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations protects the American public by aggressively investigating allegations involving FDA-regulated products and violations of the FDCA. In this case, OCI worked with the Department of Justice to ensure a just resolution, and we applaud the exceptional work done by the team.”According to court documents, surgical gowns sold in the United States are subject to regulation by the FDA, which recognizes a system of classification set forth by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) — known as the ANSI/AAMI PB70 standard. The ANSI/AAMI PB70 standard was first established in 2003 and revised to be more rigorous in 2012. Under the standard, the highest protection level for surgical gowns — AAMI Level 4 — is reserved for gowns intended to be used in surgeries and other high-risk medical procedures on patients suspected of having infectious diseases.As part of the deferred prosecution agreement, Avanos admitted that between late 2014 and early 2015, it sold hundreds of thousands of MicroCool surgical gowns that were labeled as AAMI Level 4 under the 2012 ANSI/AAMI PB70 standard but did not actually meet that standard. In addition, Avanos made direct misrepresentations to customers about the MicroCool gowns’ compliance with the 2012 ANSI/AAMI PB70 standard. For example, in November 2014, Avanos sent letters to certain hospitals and other potential purchasers that falsely claimed that the MicroCool gowns met the revised and more rigorous 2012 ANSI/AAMI PB70 standard for classification as AAMI Level 4 — a standard that Avanos’s employees knew the gowns had never met. At least one of these letters was sent in response to a request for assurances made by a health care provider seeking to obtain surgical gowns for use in responding to the 2014 Ebola outbreak. In total, Avanos sold approximately $8,939,000 worth of misbranded MicroCool gowns to customers in the United States and abroad.In addition, according to court documents, an employee and an agent of Avanos obstructed a July 2016 FDA for-cause inspection of the company’s surgical gown business by making numerous false entries in four documents requested by FDA investigators.As part of the criminal resolution, Avanos has agreed to continue to cooperate with the Justice Department and to report any evidence or allegation of a violation of the FDCA or U.S. obstruction or fraud laws committed by Avanos’s employees or agents upon any domestic government agency (including the FDA), regulator or any of Avanos’s customers. Avanos has further agreed to strengthen its compliance program and abide by specific reporting requirements, which require the company to submit yearly reports to the government regarding the status of Avanos’s enhancements to its compliance program and internal controls, policies and procedures aimed at deterring and detecting violations of the FDCA and U.S. obstruction and fraud laws, and the status of its remediation efforts.The government reached this resolution with Avanos based on a number of factors, including the nature and seriousness of the offense conduct and Avanos’s failure to timely and voluntarily self disclose the offense conduct to the department. In addition, Avanos fully cooperated with the investigation conducted by the government, including conducting a thorough internal investigation, meeting requests from the government promptly, making factual presentations to the government, assisting in making a key foreign-based employee available for interview, and producing extensive documentation to the government, including documents located in a foreign jurisdiction.The government also considered that Avanos engaged in remedial measures after the offense conduct, including: (i) changing the manufacturing process for the MicroCool surgical gowns to improve the quality of their sleeve seams; (ii) reorganizing its quality and regulatory departments so that they report directly to the CEO; (iii) substantially increasing the budget and headcount of its compliance and quality departments; (iv) creating a stand-alone Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors; (v) enhancing the independence, autonomy and resources of its compliance function by creating a stand-alone compliance department and appointing a full-time Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer who reports directly to the CEO and presents compliance reports to the Compliance Committee at least five times per year; (vi) enhancing compliance training for its employees; and (vii) implementing revised procedures for the review and approval of all medical device marketing material.The criminal case was investigated by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations.Senior Litigation Counsel Allan Gordus and Trial Attorneys David Gunn and Max Goldman of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch, Trial Attorney John “Fritz” Scanlon of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Katherine Miller of the Northern District of Texas prosecuted the case.Attachment(s):Download Avanos Criminal Information.pdfDownload Avanos DPA.pdfTopic(s):Consumer ProtectionHealth Care FraudComponent(s):Civil DivisionCriminal DivisionCriminal - Criminal Fraud SectionUSAO - Texas, NorthernPress Release Number:21-628"

Costello of the Southern District of Alabama announced that Richard and Monique Parker of Spanish Fort, Alabama, doing business as FB McGuinness were sentenced in federal court on four counts of an information. The Parkers pled guilty to introducing misbranded animal drugs into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud or mislead, operating an unregistered drug establishment, and the sale of unregistered, adulterated, and misbranded pesticides.According to documents filed as part of the defendant’s guilty plea the Parkers operated a business, F.B. McGuinness, from their residence in Spanish Fort. F.B. McGuinness sold products from a catalogue, including drugs and pesticides mainly focused on the cockfighting industry. The facility was unregistered with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These products included items that were repackaged and labeled to include false FDA and NADA numbers on F.B. McGuinness products. Through a series of anonymous purchases, products were obtained from the F.B. McGuinness catalogue. An analysis of the products purchased indicated that these items were mislabeled or not as they were advertised.In October 2020 a search warrant was executed at the Parker’s residence and location of their catalogue business. The Parkers admitted to producing and packaging drugs and pesticides at their residence for several years.  The Parkers went on to admit that many of the products were repackaged and relabeled for F.B. McGuinness. The Parkers stated that the false FDA and NADA numbers on the F.B. McGuinness products gave a perception of legitimacy for their customers.The F.B. McGuinness catalogue included products the FDA no longer approved for sale in the United States because they contained suspected carcinogens. Additionally, the EPA determined the Parker’s facility contained pesticides that were inactive or no longer allowed to be marketed in the United States.At sentencing, the Parkers were sentenced to a three year term of probation, a $5,000 fine and the forfeiture of $100,000.The case was investigated by the FDA, the EPA, and the FBI.“Since 2014, the defendants sold to customers across the country over $3 million of products, which included unregistered pesticides without instructions on how to use the product safely,” said Special Agent-in-Charge Chuck Carfagno of EPA’s Criminal Investigation Division in Atlanta. “Today’s sentencing shows that EPA and our law enforcement partners will hold responsible those who violate our pesticide laws and put the public at risk.”“The FDA regulates animal drugs as part of its mission to protect the public health, which includes ensuring that prescription animal drugs are lawfully distributed and dispensed pursuant to a valid prescription,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin C. Fielder, Ph.D., FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Miami Field Office. “These laws are in place not only for the well-being of the animals, but also to protect consumers from animals that may be used for food that may contain unsafe drug residues. We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who attempt to evade the law.”This matter was prosecuted by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Alabama.Component(s):USAO - Alabama, Southern"

Burroughs to one year and one day in prison and three years of supervised release, with the first year to be severed in home confinement. On Jan. 28, 2021, Croft pleaded guilty to one count of tampering with a consumer product and one count of acquiring a controlled substance by deception and subterfuge.While working at a Massachusetts hospital in January 2016, Croft administered hydromorphone and meperidine – both Schedule II controlled substances – to emergency department patients in need of pain relief. A month earlier, in December 2015, Croft had entered into an Agreement Not to Practice with the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Nursing after being terminated from a previous position as a nurse. Croft did not inform his then-current employer that he had voluntarily agreed not to practice. Between Jan. 5 and Jan. 14, 2016, Croft tampered with carpujects – syringe devices used to administer injectable fluid medication – containing hydromorphone and meperidine by accessing the automated dispensing machine (ADM) in the hospital’s emergency department.Specifically, Croft used his credentials to enter false “cancel” or “return to stock” transactions in the ADM, which allowed him to remove carpujects containing hydromorphone and meperidine. He then used syringes to puncture the carpujects and remove portions of the hydromorphone and meperidine for his own use. In several instances, Croft replaced the medication he removed with saline in an attempt to conceal his conduct. To avoid detection, Croft later put the carpujects with the diluted medication back in the ADM where they remained available for nurses to unwittingly use on patients.Acting United States Attorney Nathaniel R. Mendell; Jeffrey Ebersole, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, New York Field Office; and Margaret R.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of Puerto RicoFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, June 23, 2021SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico– Defendant Bryan Gilbert Díaz-De Jesús, a.k.a. “Bryan Gilbert De Jesús,” was sentenced today to 72 months (6 years) in prison for conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, possession with intent to distribute controlled substances, introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce, and use of a communication facility, announced United States Attorney for the District of Puerto Rico, W. Stephen Muldrow. Díaz- De Jesús pleaded guilty on November 20, 2019.From May 2019 through August 2019, Díaz-De Jesús, conspired with others to knowingly possess with intent to distribute and to distribute fentanyl, cocaine, and heroin in Puerto Rico. The defendant introduced and caused the introduction into interstate commerce, and with the intent to defraud and mislead, a “drug” as defined under Title 21,United States Code, Section 321(g)(1) – specifically, N-phenyl-N-[1(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperindinyl] propenamide, commonly known as fentanyl, that was misbranded, in that the drug’s labeling failed to bear adequate directions for use.Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 80-100 times stronger than morphine. Pharmaceutical fentanyl was developed for pain management treatment of cancer patients, applied in a patch on the skin. Because of its powerful opioid properties, fentanyl is also diverted for abuse by drug users. Fentanyl is often added to heroin by criminal drug distributors to increase the heroin’s potency to produce a stronger effect on the structure/function of the bodies of drug users. Many users believe that they are purchasing heroin and are unaware that they are, in fact, purchasing fentanyl. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, just two (2) milligrams of fentanyl is a lethal dose for most people.“Fentanyl is an extremely dangerous drug, far more potent than heroin, and its use very often results in death. Fentanyl is the number one threat in the opioid epidemic in the United States, and we are seeing an increase in the presence of fentanyl laced with other drugs in Puerto Rico, said U.S. Attorney Muldrow. “Federal law provides for particularly severe consequences when illegal drug trafficking results in death. We intend to use every available tool to combat this terrible problem, including these enhanced penalties.”“The opioid epidemic that has resulted in overdoses and deaths is a national public health crisis. Those who contribute to that crisis and threaten the health and safety of Americans by illicitly distributing opioids will be brought to justice,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin Fielder, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Miami Field Office. “The FDA is fully committed to disrupting and dismantling networks engaged in the manufacturing and sale of illicit opioids and misbranded prescription drugs.”The Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and US Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) are in charge of the investigation in collaboration with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).Assistant U.S. Attorney María L.

Some of the testing referred to the lab was paid for by Medicare, Virginia Medicaid, and TennCare.Between November 30, 2015, and May 30, 2016, Linke was employed at an office-based opioid treatment program that used medication-assisted treatment for patients suffering from substance use disorder. In exchange for being paid $5,000 per month, Linke arranged for the clinic to send urine drug screen samples to the laboratory in Florida where Olshavasky worked.  These payments were disguised as commissions paid to Linke as an “independent sales representative” for Olshavsky’s company, Encore Holdings LLC. Olshavasky paid Linke at least $16,000 through Encore Holdings to direct WRC’s drug screening business to the Florida lab, although Linke was not actually an independent sales representative for Encore, and he did not act as such.“This prosecution demonstrates our commitment to protect the integrity of the health care system and hold individuals accountable who seek to fraudulently obtain critical Medicare and Medicaid funds,” Acting U.S. Attorney Bubar stated.  “We will continue to investigate and prosecute healthcare providers who attempt to divert these funds for their own use.  I am grateful for the continued partnership of the Virginia Attorney General’s Office and our other federal and state partners, whose hard work brought these providers to justice.”“Healthcare providers who act fraudulently are not only stealing from our healthcare system but they are also stealing from taxpayers and they must be held accountable,” said Attorney General Herring. “I want to thank our local, state, and federal partners who worked alongside my Medicaid Fraud Control Unit to bring this case to justice and I look forward to our continued partnership on other important cases.”“Those who seek to profit off the opioid crisis through illegal schemes make the problem worse,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S.

The government alleged that from 2016 to 2019, Brooks marketed supplements containing anabolic steroids such as androsterone, trestolone, epiandrosterone and methylstenbolone to the bodybuilding and fitness community. Anabolic steroids are Schedule III substances under the Controlled Substances Act, and they may have dangerous effects on users, including increasing the risk of liver damage, coronary artery disease, strokes and heart attacks.The government also alleged that the supplements distributed by Brooks included a product labeled as containing Arimistane, an aromatase inhibitor typically used with steroids to decrease estrogen production. The FDA has long warned that aromatase inhibitors have been linked to significant health risks such as a decreased rate of bone maturation and growth, decreased sperm production, infertility, aggressive behavior, adrenal insufficiency, kidney failure and liver dysfunction. In pleading guilty, Brooks admitted that he knowingly took steps to mislead and defraud the government and consumers, in part by using an unregistered contract manufacturer to import ingredients and produce the unlawful products.“Marketing unapproved and potentially unsafe drugs as dietary supplements endangers consumers,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department of Justice will continue working with its law enforcement and agency partners to prosecute those who flout the law at the expense of public health.”“When Brooks and his company marketed and sold steroids and other supplements within the fitness community, they undermined the FDA approval process and seriously risked the health and safety of consumers,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Daniel P.

KVK-TECH was also charged with one count of mail fraud arising from the alleged sale of unapproved drugs to customers who believed the drugs were made with the approval of the FDA.According to the Indictment, from approximately October 2010 through at least March 2015, Vepuri, the de facto owner of KVK-TECH, and Panchal, the company’s head of Quality Assurance, conspired to defraud the United States and its agencies by impeding, impairing, and defeating FDA’s mission to protect the health and safety of the public by ensuring that drugs marketed and distributed in the United States are safe and effective for their intended uses.As alleged in the Indictment, Vepuri directed KVK-TECH’s day-to-day operations and made all key business decisions for the company, including decisions related to drug regulatory requirements, drug composition, drug manufacturing quality, purity, and potency. However, Vepuri – who previously owned a generic drug manufacturer in New Jersey that was subject to a restraining order due to ongoing FDA violations – is charged with hiding his involvement in KVK-TECH by placing its ownership in private trusts for the benefit of his children. Vepuri then allegedly represented to the FDA that he was merely an advisor or consultant to KVK-TECH, when in reality he exercised unchecked authority over the company.As alleged, under Vepuri’s control, KVK-TECH ignored regulatory requirements that had the potential to slow the manufacture, distribution, and sales of its drugs. Vepuri and Panchal are also charged with having provided false explanations to the FDA when inspectors identified violations. Often, Vepuri and Panchal attributed regulatory failures to a mistake or misunderstanding, and KVK-TECH would falsely assure the FDA that violations had been addressed when they knew no corrective and preventative actions had been taken.The Indictment highlights KVK-TECH’s conduct with regard to Hydroxyzine, a KVK-TECH prescription drug for the treatment of anxiety, for which Vepuri purchased an active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) made in Mexico by Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories (“DRL Mexico”). DRL Mexico was not an FDA-approved source. To the contrary, as alleged, the defendants knew that DRL Mexico’s API was considered adulterated by the FDA due to significant violations of good manufacturing practices (cGMP) at DRL Mexico’s manufacturing plant. The cGMP violations were so severe that the FDA issued an import alert for all DRL Mexico API from July 2011 through July 2012. Nonetheless, from 2011 through 2013, KVK-TECH is charged with having knowingly distributed more than 383,000 bottles of the unapproved Hydroxyzine without the FDA’s knowledge or approval.“FDA laws and regulations regarding drug composition, manufacturing, quality, and related controls are designed to protect Americans’ health and safety – so we can all be confident that our prescription medications will be safe and effective,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Williams. “When companies attempt to game the system to avoid these regulations and increase their profits, the ramifications are potentially catastrophic.  As this Indictment makes clear, any individuals or companies that try to evade the law in this manner will be brought to justice.”“The FDA’s requirements for drug approval are designed to ensure that patients receive safe and effective medical treatments. Evading the FDA process and distributing unapproved drugs to U.S. consumers will not be tolerated,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Metro Washington Field Office.  “We will continue to investigate and protect the public health of the nation.”“An important mission of the Office of Inspector General is to investigate allegations of fraud against the Department of Labor’s programs. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to investigate these types of allegations,” stated Syreeta Scott, Acting Special Agent-in-Charge, Philadelphia Region, U.S. Department of Labor Office of Inspector General.If convicted, Vepuri and Panchal each face a maximum possible sentence of five years in prison, three years of supervised release, a $250,000 fine and other financial penalties including forfeiture. KVK-TECH faces fines up to $4 million and other financial penalties such as forfeiture and probation. The parties also face mandatory exclusion from participating in federal programs.The case was investigated by the FDA-Office of Criminal Investigations, Homeland Security Investigations, and the Department of Labor Office of Inspector General, and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys M. Beth Leahy and Patrick J. Murray, and Ross Goldstein, Senior Litigation Counsel for the Department of Justice Consumer Protection Branch.An indictment, information, or criminal complaint is an accusation.  A defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.Topic(s):Prescription DrugsComponent(s):USAO - Pennsylvania, EasternContact:UNITED STATES ATTORNEY’S OFFICE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA 615 Chestnut Street, Suite 1250 Philadelphia, PA 19106 JENNIFER CRANDALL Media Contact 215-861-8300 If you have not done so already, follow @USAO_EDPA and @USAttyWilliams on Twitter to get the most up-to-date information about big cases and community news."

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of FloridaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, June 11, 2021Miami, Florida –A South Florida grand jury has charged five additional defendants for their alleged roles in a sophisticated scheme to purchase and distribute millions of dollars in diverted pharmaceutical drugs. A total of 14 defendants have now been charged in this case (19-cr-20674).Diverted pharmaceutical drugs are branded medications, produced by the original pharmaceutical developers, that make their way into the underground market through fraud, pharmacy burglaries, and cargo thefts. Diverted pharmaceuticals typically are high-priced medical drugs used to treat conditions such as mental illness, human immunodeficiency (HIV), and cancer.The Second Superseding Indictment returned on June 10, 2021, charges South Florida residents Stephen Manuel Costa, 37, Leah Solomon, 51, Rafael Angel Romero, 50, Ruben Reynaldo Rodriguez Diaz, 43, and Phoenix, Arizona resident David Ramirez Garcia, Sr., 58, with money laundering, mail fraud and violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act. It is alleged these defendants and their earlier charged co-conspirators purchased large quantities of diverted pharmaceutical drugs on the unregulated, underground market at a cost well below normal wholesale prices. Then, they used seemingly legitimate wholesale companies and fraudulent paperwork to introduce the diverted drugs back into the legitimate marketplace by selling them to unwitting pharmacies and consumers at big mark-ups, it is alleged. According to the Second Superseding Indictment, the operation was so large that co-conspirators purchased two wholesale pharmaceutical companies and chartered a plane to deliver the drugs.See also prior press release athttps://www.justice.gov/usao-sdfl/pr/two-ceos-wholesale-pharmaceutical-companies-and-two-owners-bank-accounts-used-money.Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Juan Antonio Gonzalez, FBI Miami Special Agent in Charge George L.

Navarro was a sub-investigator, and Varona was an assistant study coordinator. As part of their plea agreements, Navarro and Varona admitted that they agreed with one another and others to falsify data in medical records in connection with two clinical trials intended to evaluate a treatment for irritable bowel syndrome. Among other things, Navarro and Varona falsified data to make it appear as though subjects were participating in the trials when, in truth, they were not.“The falsification of clinical trial data puts the health and safety of the public at risk,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Justice Department will continue to work with its partners at the Food and Drug Administration to investigate and prosecute anyone who engages in this conduct.”“Public health and safety must always take precedence over profit when new pharmaceutical drugs are being tested,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Juan Antonio Gonzalez for the Southern District of Florida. “Medical researchers needlessly endanger the public by manipulating clinical data and falsifying records. Such conduct is illegal and will be prosecuted.”“FDA’s evaluation of a new drug begins with an analysis of reliable and accurate data from clinical trials,” said Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations Catherine A. Hermsen of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations. “Compromised clinical trial data could impact the agency’s decisions about the safety and effectiveness of the drug under review. We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those whose actions may subvert the FDA approval process and endanger the public health.”Navarro and Varona both pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Jose E.

The United States alleged that from 2016 to 2020, Puccio marketed drugs as “dietary supplements” to the bodybuilding and fitness community. The supplements included a product labeled as containing ostarine, a type of synthetic steroid known as a Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (SARM). The FDA has long warned against the use of SARMs, including statingin a 2017 warning letterto another firm that SARMs had been linked to life-threatening reactions such as liver toxicity, and have the potential to increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.“Undermining the FDA drug approval process puts consumers at risk, especially when those drugs contain ingredients that can cause harm,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department of Justice will continue to work closely with the FDA to prosecute those who put profit before the public health.”“When Mr. Puccio marketed unapproved drugs as dietary supplements, he sidestepped important safeguards to protect the public, and must be held accountable,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Daniel P. Bubar of the Western District of Virginia. “Our office will continue to closely partner with FDA to ensure safety and effectiveness in our drug supply and prosecute those who flout these rules.”“Marketing misbranded dietary supplements that contain unapproved drugs is illegal and is a threat to public health,” said Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations Catherine A.

Frohling of the Eastern District of Wisconsin announced that on June 8, 2021, Steven R. Brandenburg (age: 46) of Grafton, Wisconsin, was sentenced to 36 months’ imprisonment for tampering with COVID vaccine doses at the hospital at which he worked. Brandenburg will also be required to spend three years on supervised release following his prison sentence and was ordered to pay approximately $83,800 in restitution to the hospital.Brandenburg pleaded guilty on February 9, 2021, to two counts of attempting to tamper with consumer products with reckless disregard for the risk that another person would be placed in danger of death or bodily injury.According to court documents, Brandenburg purposefully removed a box of COVID-19 vaccine vials manufactured by Moderna—which must be stored at specific cold temperatures to remain viable—from a hospital refrigeration unit during two successive overnight shifts in late December 2020. According to his plea agreement, Brandenburg stated that he was skeptical of vaccines in general and the Moderna vaccine specifically. Court documents indicate that Brandenburg had communicated his beliefs about vaccines to his co-workers for at least the past two years.Brandenburg acknowledged that after leaving the vaccines out for several hours each night, he returned the vaccines to the refrigerator to be used in the hospital’s vaccine clinic the following day. Before the full extent of Brandenburg’s conduct was discovered, 57 people received doses of the vaccine from these vials.“The purposeful attempt to spoil vaccine doses during a national public health emergency is a serious crime,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. “The Department of Justice will continue working with its law enforcement partners to safeguard these life-saving vaccines.”“Ensuring access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines is critical to the well-being of everyone in our communities,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Frohling. “The Department of Justice is committed to working with its federal, state, and local partners to hold individuals who seek to tamper with these vaccines fully accountable. Today’s sentence was the direct result of that shared commitment and the underlying hard work and collaborative efforts of all involved in the investigation and prosecution of Mr. Brandenburg.”“The FBI, together with our local law enforcement and private sector partners, are committed to upholding laws designed to protect our health care system from harm. By illegally tampering with these doses, Brandenburg threatened the health and safety of an entire community,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge, Robert Hughes. “Today’s sentencing sends a clear message to individuals who intentionally violate these laws that they will be vigorously prosecuted.”The FDA has ensured that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine meets the agency’s rigorous standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality. Those who knowingly tamper with this vaccine place American patients’ health at risk,” said FDA Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations Catherine A. Hermsen. “Today’s announcement should serve as a reminder that this kind of illicit tampering activity will not be tolerated.”This matter was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, the Milwaukee Field Office of the FBI, and the Village of Grafton Police Department.Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin C.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of VermontWednesday, June 2, 2021The United States Attorney’s Office announced that today William Kelly, 72, of Weston, Florida, pleaded guilty before Chief Judge Geoffrey W. Crawford in United States District Court in Rutland to two felony charges in connection with his involvement in the Jay Peak Biomedical Research Park EB-5 investment project, also called the AnC Vermont project.Kelly pleaded guilty to conspiring with co-defendants Ariel Quiros, Jong Weon (Alex) Choi, and William Stenger in a multi-year wire fraud scheme to defraud immigrant investors seeking green cards through the EB-5 program.  He also pleaded guilty to concealing material facts in a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency, namely United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which oversaw the EB-5 program.According to court records and proceedings, the AnC Vermont project was designed to raise $110 million from 220 immigrant investors in order to construct and operate a biotechnology facility in Newport, Vermont.  EB-5 immigrant investors could qualify for permanent resident status (commonly known as a green card) by investing $500,000 in a commercial enterprise approved by the Vermont EB-5 Regional Center (VRC), which had the authority to approve and monitor EB-5 projects in Vermont, and by USCIS.  In order to obtain a green card, each investor needed to demonstrate to USCIS that his or her investment had created, or would soon create, ten jobs.  From 2012 to 2016, approximately 169 investors invested approximately $85 million in the AnC Vermont project, in addition to paying approximately $8 million in “administrative fees.”During the plea hearing, Kelly admitted that he and his co-conspirators misled AnC Vermont investors about how investor funds would be used, about how many jobs would be created by the project, and about the timeline for this job creation.  For example, Kelly and others knew that it was necessary to demonstrate a plan to create at least 2,200 jobs in order to obtain USCIS approval of the AnC Vermont project, and that USCIS approval and business revenues were both important to investors.  The jobs report for the project was directly based on hiring and financial projections generated by Kelly, Choi, and Stenger to justify the job creation number required for EB-5 approval.  Kelly knew that no one had assessed whether the purported financial projections in the project’s business plan were reasonable.  The job creation projections relied on three lines of business: clean room rentals, sales of stem cell products, and sales of artificial organs.  Between 2012 and 2016, Kelly and his co-conspirators maintained the jobs numbers in spite of the fact that no one associated with the AnC Vermont project was making progress toward identifying customers for clean room rentals, acquiring commercially viable stem cell products, or developing the potential artificial organs.During today’s hearing, Kelly also admitted that between March 2013 and October 2014, he helped Quiros and Stenger pay over $47 million in AnC Vermont investor money to Jay Construction Management, a Quiros-controlled entity that was designated as a pass-through corporation for approximately $52 million that was supposedly to be paid to AnC Biopharm, a company created and controlled by Choi in part to conceal Choi’s legal and financial problems.  During this period, Kelly knew that Quiros forwarded less than $6 million from JCM to AnC Biopharm.  Kelly knew that Quiros used approximately $21 million of the AnC Vermont investor funds sent to JCM to pay off a Raymond James loan that was used for expenses unrelated to the AnC Vermont project.  In addition to the wire fraud conspiracy charge, Kelly admitted helping conceal from the VRC that Quiros had used the $21 million in AnC Vermont investor funds for purposes unrelated to the AnC Vermont project.In the plea agreement, Kelly agreed to cooperate in the government’s ongoing matters.  The plea agreement caps Kelly’s jail sentence at 36 months, so long as he abides by the terms of the agreement.  The government agreed that it would not recommend a fine or forfeiture, but instead focus on seeking a restitution order for victims.  The government requested that the Court delay Kelly’s sentencing pending his ongoing cooperation.Co-defendant Quiros pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering, and concealment charges in August 2020 and currently awaits sentencing.  Co-defendant Stenger has entered a not guilty plea to the pending charges, which are only allegations.  Stenger is presumed to be innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.  The Court has scheduled his trial for October 2021.  Co-defendant Choi remains at large.Acting United States Attorney Jonathan Ophardt expressed his gratitude for the outstanding investigative assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Criminal Investigation Divisions of the Internal Revenue Service, the Food and Drug Administration, and for the assistance of the Justice Department’s Fraud Section and Office of International Affairs.  The prosecutors handling the case are Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nicole Cate and Paul Van de Graaf and Trial Attorney Jessee Alexander-Hoeppner, from the

Tricare is the health care benefit program covering military personnel and their dependents.According to court documents, 51-year-old Erik Santos and his co-conspirators ran the scheme as follows: Santos paid recruiters to convince Tricare beneficiaries to fill prescriptions for expensive, supposedly tailor-made, compounded medications that the beneficiaries did not need. Santos paid doctors to approve pre-printed prescriptions for large amounts of these medications. The doctors did not see the beneficiaries or otherwise consider their medical needs before approving the prescriptions. Lastly, Santos steered the Tricare beneficiaries to fill their prescriptions with Patient Care America (PCA), a compounding pharmacy located in Broward County, Florida. PCA would bill Tricare for expensive drug formulations that had little to no therapeutic value. Many of the compounded medications were billed to Tricare at $10,000 to $15,000 for a month’s supply, even though the ingredients used in the mixtures were little more than common pain or scar creams. Santos’s fraudulent referrals caused an actual loss to the Tricare program of approximately $12 million. PCA pharmacy paid Santos over $7 million in prescription referral kickbacks.In addition to the prison sentence, the Court imposed restitution in the amount of $11.8 million and entered a forfeiture judgement of approximately $7.6 million. On January 27, 2021, Santos pled guilty in federal district court in Ft. Lauderdale to one count of conspiring to commit health care fraud and wire fraud.Acting U.S. Attorney Juan Antonio Gonzalez of the Southern District of Florida, Special Agent in Charge Cynthia A. Bruce of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), Southeast Field Office, and Special Agent in Charge George L. Piro of FBI Miami announced the sentence.“Criminals steal exorbitant amounts of money from our government health programs through prescription medication fraud schemes. This significant sentence recognizes the seriousness of the crime,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Gonzalez. “Those who use kickbacks and other illegal activity to bilk taxpayer dollars from vital public programs will be held accountable.”“Billing healthcare programs for medically unnecessary medications not only undermines the viability of those programs, it exploits all citizens,” said DCIS Special Agent in Charge Bruce. “I am pleased with the significant outcome of this investigation and would like to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the investigative team for their tireless effort and great work to hold accountable those who fraudulently bill the Defense Health Agency.”“Illegal kickbacks undermined the integrity of the Tricare health benefit program by putting profits in front of patient welfare,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Piro. “The investigators who unraveled this scam are to be commended for their diligence and commitment. The FBI and our partners will continue to pursue those individuals who pay kickbacks and fraudulently bill for medical services that are not necessary.”DCIS investigated the case with assistance from FBI Miami and the Food and Drug Administration-Office of Criminal Investigation. The superseding indictment also named CHAMPVA (the Department of Veterans Affairs’ version of Tricare) as a fraud target and the Department of Veterans Affairs-Office of Inspector General assisted with the investigation.Assistant U.S. Attorney Jon Juenger prosecuted the case.

Escalona and FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Miami Field Office Special Agent in Charge Justin C. Fielder.U.S. Senior District Judge Karen O. Bowdre sentencedPatrick Charles Bishop, 54, to 30 months in prison followed by three years’ supervised release for conspiracy to fraudulently introduce adulterated drugs and misbranded drugs into interstate commerce.  Judge Bowdre also ordered Bishop to forfeit $900,000 in proceeds from his crimes.  Bishop pleaded guilty to the charge in January.“The defendant posed a dangerous threat to patients who thought they were receiving an approved and effective treatment for cancer,” U.S. Attorney Escalona said.  “My office will continue to prosecute those who deceive the public by selling unapproved drug products.”“The FDA’s requirements are designed to ensure that patients receive safe and effective medical treatments.  Evading the FDA process and distributing unapproved, adulterated, and misbranded drugs to vulnerable Americans will not be tolerated,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin C.

Hall in New Haven for tampering with fentanyl vials intended for patients at the fertility clinic where she was employed. Monticone was ordered to serve three years of supervised release, four weekends of incarceration, and three months of home confinement.According to court documents and statements made in court, Monticone was a nurse employed by the Yale Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility clinic (“Yale REI clinic”) in Orange. As part of her responsibilities at the Yale REI, Monticone ordered and inventoried a variety of narcotics used by the clinic, including fentanyl, which is a component of a cohort of drugs used by Yale physicians during outpatient surgical procedures to anesthetize patients and protect them from feeling pain.In June 2020, Monticone began stealing fentanyl for her own use. She accessed secure storage areas and took vials of fentanyl, used a syringe to withdraw the narcotics from the vials, and reinjected saline into vials so that it would appear as if none of the narcotics were missing. The investigation revealed that approximately 75 percent of the fentanyl given to patients at the Yale REI clinic from June to October 2020 was adulterated with saline. Some of the vials contained diluted fentanyl, while others contained no drug at all and contained just saline.Monticone knew that the adulterated vials of fentanyl she replaced at the Yale REI clinic would be used in surgical procedures, and that the absence of an anesthetic during an outpatient procedure may cause serious bodily injury to the patient. Monticone initially injected herself with the fentanyl while working at the Yale REI clinic and eventually began taking the vials home. She would refill the vials with sterile saline at home, bring them back to the clinic, and reintroduce them into the stock of fentanyl available for use during surgical procedures. On approximately November 1, 2020, Monticone brought approximately 175 vials of fentanyl that she had taken from the Yale REI clinic and discarded them in waste containers at the clinic.Numerous victims submitted letters to Judge Hall describing physical pain they experienced during their procedures at the Yale REI clinic during this time period.On March 2, 2021, Monticone pleaded guilty to one count of tampering with a consumer product.Monticone has surrendered her nursing license.This matter was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations; the DEA’s New Haven Tactical Diversion Squad; and the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection, Drug Control Division.

Instead the website was allegedly used to collect the personal information of individuals visiting the site, in order to use the information for nefarious purposes, including fraud, phishing attacks, and/or deployment of malware. Individuals visiting the site will now see a message that the site has been seized by the federal government and be redirected to another site for additional information. This is the 10th COVID fraud related domain name seized by the Maryland U.S. Attorney’s Office.The seizure of the domain name was announced by Acting United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Jonathan F. Lenzner and Special Agent in Charge James R. Mancuso of Homeland Security Investigations - Baltimore.“This is the 10th fraudulent website taking advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic that we have seized in recent months,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Jonathan F. Lenzner. “In a time when we are urging people to get vaccinated for COVID-19, it is reprehensible that fraudsters are trying to prey on unsuspecting residents and their families. Remember that the COVID vaccine is not for sale, and the federal government is providing the vaccine free of charge to people living in the United States. We urge all Maryland residents to be skeptical - don’t provide personal information or click on links in unsolicited e-mails.”“With the help of HSI’s cybersecurity experts, our office will continue to target bogus websites, social media platforms and any other online forums responsible for advertising counterfeit vaccines, treatments and information for COVID-19,” said Special Agent in Charge for the HSI Baltimore Field Office, James Mancuso. “We will not allow criminal networks to profit from these scams.”According to the affidavit filed in support of the seizure, the HSI Intellectual Property Rights Center (“IPRC”) and the HSI Cyber Crimes Center (“C3”) discovered an apparent fraudulent website, named “COVIDReliefSociety.org.” A domain analysis conducted by HSI indicated the domain name was created on December 26, 2020.The HSI Cyber Operations Officer (COO) noted a blog post on the webpage stating “you can now buy Covid-19 Vaccine Online from the Covid-19 Relief Society and have it delivered same day anywhere in the world. The vaccine is for preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in people aged 18 years and older. Even though the Covid-19 vaccine distribution is still slow, you can order it online from us the Covid-19 Relief Society. We can offer as much as 2 Million doses in a single expedited delivery. Send inquiries today if you are looking to order Covid-19 Vaccine online.”  This blog post contained a photograph of boxes that contained the text, “Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.” The blog page contains a “Click Here to Buy” button, but it does not appear to function. The website contains an image of what appears to be a screen capture of the Moderna webpage, including the trademarked Moderna logo. The domain name was not authorized to utilize the trademarked Moderna logo, nor to offer their vaccines for sale.By seizing the site, the government has prevented third parties from acquiring the name and using it to commit additional crimes, as well as prevented third parties from continuing to access the site in its present form.Federal law enforcement agencies are united in our efforts to fight against COVID-19 fraud.  HSI has identified tips to recognize and report COVID-19 fraud. If you believe you are a victim of a fraud or attempted fraud involving COVID-19, you may also call the National Center for Disaster Fraud Hotline at 1-866-720-5721 or for more information visit justice.gov/coronavirus.Acting United States Attorney Jonathan F. Lenzner commended HSI for its work in this investigation.  Mr. Lenzner recognized the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the Baltimore County Police Department for their assistance and thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Aaron S.J. Zelinsky and Sean R. Delaney, who are handling the case.# # #"

Unlimited Medical Research was one of many companies hired to conduct a clinical trial designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of an asthma medication in children. The indictment alleges that Palacio participated in a scheme to falsify medical records to make it appear as though pediatric subjects made scheduled visits to Unlimited Medical Research, received physical exams from a clinical investigator, and took study drugs as required, when in fact these things had not occurred. The indictment also alleges that when Palacio was confronted by a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory investigator about her conduct, she made a false statement to that investigator.“Falsifying clinical trial data risks the health and safety of those who might later rely upon the drugs being tested,” said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Arun G. Rao of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department of Justice will continue to work with its partners at the Food and Drug Administration to investigate and prosecute anyone who endangers the public for financial gain.”“When the efficacy of a new pharmaceutical drug is tested, public health and safety must always take precedence over profit,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Juan Antonio Gonzalez for the Southern District of Florida. “Medical researchers who manipulate clinical data and falsify records needlessly endanger the public and will be prosecuted.”“Reliable and accurate data from clinical trials is the cornerstone of FDA’s evaluation of a new drug,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin C. Fielder of the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Miami Field Office. “Compromised clinical trial data could impact the agency’s decisions about the safety and effectiveness of the drug under review. We will continue to monitor, investigate and bring to justice those whose actions may subvert the FDA approval process and endanger the public health.”Palacio is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and making a false statement. The defendant is expected to make her initial court appearance later this week in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.

Kaufman announced today.United States District Judge Mark R. Hornak sentenced Julia Fees, 29, to four years of probation. Fees was also ordered to forfeit a total of approximately $231,000 to the United States.During the defendant’s plea hearing on Jan. 17, 2019, Fees admitted her role in obtaining and distributing etizolam to individual consumers for their personal, recreational use. Etizolam, as Fees admitted, is a drug known as a thienodiazepine, which is chemically similar to benzodiazepines (e.g., Xanax) and carries risks of dependency, toxicity, and the possibility of fatal overdose—particularly in combination with other depressants. Etizolam is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the United States, and it cannot legally be imported, distributed, or prescribed domestically for use as a drug. The defendant further admitted that she and her business partner and co-conspirator, William Kulakevich, illegally brought significant quantities of etizolam into the United States from an overseas supplier—an Indian national named Jeetendra Belani, aka Jeetu—for the purpose of distributing the drug to individual consumers. As part of the conspiracy, the defendant arranged to have etizolam smuggled into the United States from Belani through the use of, among other means, multiple post office boxes controlled by the defendants. To evade scrutiny by regulatory and law enforcement authorities, Fees and Kulakevich used false and misleading packaging, and generally misrepresented the nature of the products sold on their website.In addition, in order to promote their continued illegal activities, Fees and Kulakevich engaged in money laundering activity, including by using varied methods to transfer funds to Belani in India as payment for his ongoing supply of etizolam. These methods included international wire transfers, virtual currency payments, and even cash payments. To further mask the co-conspirators’ activities, Fees admitted using used a front entity—Clicken Little LLC—and related bank accounts to route payments between the defendants and Belani.Kulakevich and Belani previously pleaded guilty for their roles in the etizolam conspiracies—among other offenses as to Belani—and were sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment and approximately thirteen months’ imprisonment, respectively.Assistant United States Attorney Eric G.

(Tetrahydrocannabinol, orTHC, is the psychoactive compound found in marijuana.)In September 2019, U.S. Customs & Border Protection agents intercepted a shipment of 2,400 counterfeit THC vaping devices addressed to Mr. Reyes and bound for his home. The vaping devices, which were sent from China and routed through DFW International Airport, bore the counterfeit trademark of a popular THC vape brand, “Cookies.” Agents estimated that at least five additional shipments of vaping products had been sent to Mr. Reyes.In plea papers, the defendant admitted that after receiving the packages, he sold the contents back to the vaping shop for profit. His bank statements, which show large purchases from Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba (an online retailer similar to Amazon), backed up his admissions.Mr. Reyes now faces up to three years in federal prison. His sentencing is set for Thursday, Aug. 26.Following a rash oflung injuriesrelated to counterfeit vaping devices, the CDC urged the public to avoid THC- containing vapes, especially those purchased from unreliable online retailers.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeNorthern District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, April 23, 2021Physician allegedly ordered foreign product substitutes with intent to defraud and mislead patientsSAN FRANCISCO– A federal grand jury handed down an indictment charging Lindsay Marie Clark with receiving, offering, and delivering misbranded drugs and misbranded and adulterated devices, in a scheme to buy at a discount and inject into patients products lacking FDA approval, announced Acting United States Attorney Stephanie M. Hinds and Lisa L. Malinowski, Special Agent in Charge of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations, Los Angeles Field Office.The indictment, filed April 1, 2021, and unsealed earlier today, alleges that Clark, 44, of San Francisco, is a California physician, with practices in San Francisco and San Mateo, who specialized in procedures that use injectable drugs and devices for cosmetic or aesthetic purposes. The indictment explains that federal law regulates the manufacture, labeling, distribution, and administration of biologics, drugs, and devices shipped or received in interstate commerce. The law forbids, as a felony, the receipt and delivery of misbranded or adulterated products with intent to defraud and mislead. Regulated products include drugs such as injectable botulinum toxin and devices such as injectable hyaluronic acid dermal fillers. Under Congress’s regulatory scheme, the FDA approved the use of Botox®, the brand name of a drug derived from Botulinum Toxin Type A. In addition, the FDA approved the use of dermal fillers made from hyaluronic acid, as Class III medical devices, under the name Juvederm® and related names.According to the indictment, from at least April 2016 until no earlier than February 2020, Clark obtained drugs and devices, represented by sellers to be foreign versions of Botox® and Juvederm®, that were not the subjects of FDA approval. Clark allegedly obtained these products from sources abroad, primarily by ordering the drugs and devices over the phone and internet. The indictment alleges that Clark purchased at least $270,951 worth of products from these foreign online “pharmacies” and “depots,” and obtained revenue from services rendered in connection with these products, perhaps more than $1,069,880.The indictment alleges that Clark instructed staff to conceal the true identity, name, and source of these products from patients.  The indictment also alleges that Clark had patients sign misleading “consent” forms that referred only to products approved by the FDA, rather than informing patients that they were receiving unlicensed and unapproved products. The indictment further alleges that Clark charged patients the same price for the “Botox” and “Juvederm” products whether the products were FDA-licensed and approved, or unlicensed and unapproved.“Health care professionals who dispense and administer misbranded and adulterated prescription drugs and devices of unknown origin put the health of their patients at significant risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Lisa L. Malinowski, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who choose to subvert the safeguards of the legitimate drug and device regulatory regime and supply chain and jeopardize the public health.”Clark is charged with receipt in interstate commerce of a drug that is misbranded, and a device that is adulterated and misbranded, and the delivery or proffered delivery thereof for pay or otherwise, with intent to defraud and mislead, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 331(c), 333(a)(2). If convicted, she faces a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a maximum fine of $10,000. However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. § 3553.Clark made an initial appearance today in federal court before the United States Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley. She remains out of custody on bond. Her next scheduled appearance is for a status conference before Senior District Judge Susan Illston on June 4, 2021.The charges contained in the indictment are mere allegations. As in any criminal case, the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Tartakovsky is prosecuting this case with assistance from Laurie Worthen. The prosecution is a result of an investigation by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations.###"

Robinson et al., 20 Cr. 162 (JPO). MANGINI pled guilty before U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken, and will be sentenced on September 10, 2021, before Judge Oetken.U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: “Scott Mangini created and flooded the supply side of a market of greed that continues to endanger racehorses through the sale of performance-enhancing drugs. Mangini designed and created dozens of products intended for use by those engaged in fraud and animal abuse. His products were manufactured with no oversight of their composition, in shoddy facilities, despite prior efforts by state and federal regulators to shut down Mangini’s operation and strip his license. Mangini’s guilty plea underscores that our Office and our partners at the FBI are committed to the prosecution and investigation of corruption, fraud, and endangerment in the horse racing industry.”According to the prior Indictments, the Superseding Information to which MANGINI pled guilty, and other court documents, as well as statements made in public court proceedings:From at least in or about 2011 through at least in or about March 2020, MANGINI and his conspirators manufactured, sold, and shipped millions of dollars’ worth of adulterated and misbranded equine drugs, including performance-enhancing drugs (“PEDs”) intended to be administered to racehorses for the purpose of improving those horses’ race performance in order to win races and obtain prize money. MANGINI, a former pharmacist whose license was suspended in 2016, sold these drugs through several direct-to-consumer websites designed to appeal to racehorse trainers and owners, including, among others, “horseprerace.com” and “racehorsemeds.com.”MANGINI contributed to the conspiracy by, among other things, using his training to design and create custom PEDs that were advertised and sold online, using misleading labels, packaging, and return address information, including sales to customers in the Southern District of New York. Among the drugs advertised and sold during the course of the conspiracy were “blood builders,” which are used by racehorse trainers and others to increase red blood cell counts and/or the oxygenation of muscle tissue of a racehorse in order to stimulate the horse’s endurance, which enhances that horse’s performance in, and recovery from, a race, as well as customized analgesics that are used by racehorse trainers and others to deaden a horse’s nerves and block pain in order to improve a horse’s race performance. MANGINI and his co-conspirators repeatedly touted illegal drugs sold on these websites as substances that “WILL NOT TEST” in the event of drug screens by racing officials. For example, MANGINI’s pain-numbing product “Numb It Injection” was advertised as a “proprietary formula and without question the most powerful pain shot in the market today AND WILL NOT TEST,” and customers were expressly directed to administer the drug by “injection as close to the event or extreme exercise as possible.”The drugs distributed through the defendant’s websites were manufactured in non-Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) -registered facilities and carried significant risks to the animals affected through the administration of those illicit PEDs. For example, in 2016, MANGINI and his co-conspirator, Scott Robinson, who was previously convicted and sentenced in this case, received a complaint regarding the effect of his unregulated drugs on a customer’s horse: “starting bout 8 hours after I give the injection and for about 36 hours afterwards both my horses act like they are heavily sedated, can barely walk. Could I have a bad bottle of medicine, I’m afraid to give it anymore since this has happened three times.” Commenting on this complaint to MANGINI, Robinson wrote simply, “here is another one.”MANGINI is among 29 individuals charged to date in a series of Indictments arising from an investigation of a widespread scheme by racehorse trainers, veterinarians, PED distributors, and others to manufacture, distribute, and receive adulterated and misbranded PEDs and to secretly administer those PEDs to racehorses competing at all levels of professional horseracing. By evading PED prohibitions and deceiving regulators, horse racing officials, and the FDA, among others, participants in these schemes sought to improve race performance and obtain prize money from racetracks, all to the detriment and risk of the health and well-being of the racehorses.*                *                *MANGINI, 55, of Boca Raton, Florida, pled guilty to one count of conspiring to violate the federal drug misbranding and adulteration laws. This offense carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. The maximum potential sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the judge.Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the New York FBI Office’s Eurasian Organized Crime Task Force and its support of the FBI’s Integrity in Sports and Gaming Initiative. Ms. Strauss also thanked the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office, the New York State Police, and the New York City Police Department for their support of this investigation, and the FDA and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration for their assistance and expertise.This case is being handled by the Office’s Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of FloridaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, April 23, 2021Defendants Accused of Attempting to Avoid Government Regulation by Selling Products Through a Company They Deceptively Named “Genesis II Church of Health and Healing”Miami, Florida-- A federal grand jury in Miami has returned an indictment charging a Florida man -- Mark Grenon, 62 -- and his three sons -- Jonathan Grenon, 34, Jordan Grenon, 26, and Joseph Grenon, 32 -- with fraudulently marketing and selling “Miracle Mineral Solution,” a toxic industrial bleach, as a cure for COVID-19, cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, autism, malaria, hepatitis, Parkinson’s, herpes, HIV/AIDS, and other serious medical conditions, and with defying federal court orders.Jonathan and Jordan Grenon were arrested last summer on related charges based on a criminal complaint filed by Miami federal prosecutors.According to the indictment, the Grenons, all of Bradenton, Florida, manufactured, promoted, and sold a product they named Miracle Mineral Solution (“MMS”). MMS is a chemical solution containing sodium chlorite and water which, when ingested orally, became chlorine dioxide, a powerful bleach typically used for industrial water treatment or bleaching textiles, pulp, and paper. The Grenons claimed that ingesting MMS could treat, prevent, and cure COVID-19, according to the charges. The FDA, however, had not approved MMS for treatment of COVID-19, or for any other use. Rather, in prior official warning statements, the FDA had strongly urged consumers not to purchase or use MMS for any reason, explaining that drinking MMS was the same as drinking bleach and could cause dangerous side effects, including severe vomiting, diarrhea, and life-threatening low blood pressure. Seehttps://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/danger-dont-drink-miracle-mineral-solution-or-similar-products.In fact, FDA received reports of people requiring hospitalizations, developing life-threatening conditions, and even dying after drinking MMS.The indictment further alleges that before marketing MMS as a cure for COVID-19, the Grenons marketed MMS as a miracle cure-all for dozens of other serious diseases and disorders, even though the FDA had not approved MMS for any use. The Grenons sold tens of thousands of bottles of MMS nationwide, including to consumers throughout South Florida, according to the allegations. They sold this dangerous product under the guise of Genesis II Church of Health and Healing (“Genesis”), an entity they are accused of creating to avoid government regulation of MMS and shield themselves from prosecution. According to charging documents, Genesis’ own websites describe Genesis as a “non-religious church,” and Defendant Mark Grenon, the co-founder of Genesis, has repeatedly acknowledged that Genesis “has nothing to do with religion,” and that he founded Genesis to “legalize the use of MMS” and avoid “going [ ] to jail.” The Genesis websites further stated that MMS could be acquired only through a “donation” to Genesis, but the donation amounts for MMS orders were set at specific dollar amounts, and were mandatory, such that the donation amounts were effectively just sales prices. The indictment alleges that the Grenons received more than $1 million from selling MMS.The indictment also charges the Grenons with criminal contempt. The United States previously filed a civil case against the defendants and Genesis II Church of Health and Healing. See United States v. Genesis II Church of Health and Healing, et al., Case No. 20-21601-CV-WILLIAMS. In that civil case, the United States obtained court orders halting the Grenons’ distribution of MMS. According to charging documents, the Grenons willfully violated those court orders and continued to distribute MMS. The Grenons also allegedly threatened the federal judge presiding over the civil case, and threatened that, should the government attempt to enforce the court orders halting their distribution of MMS, the Grenons would “pick up guns” and instigate “a Waco.”Furthermore, according to statements made in court by federal prosecutors in Miami, a search warrant was executed for Defendant Jonathan Grenon’s house at the time of his arrest, and officers discovered that the Grenons were manufacturing MMS in a shed in Jonathan Grenon’s backyard in Bradenton, Florida. Officers seized dozens of blue chemical drums containing nearly 10,000 pounds of sodium chlorite powder, thousands of bottles of MMS, and other items used in the manufacture and distribution of MMS. The government also recovered multiple loaded firearms, including one pump-action shotgun concealed in a custom-made violin case to disguise its appearance, according to prosecutors.The indictment charges each of the Grenons with one count of conspiracy to commit fraud and two counts of criminal contempt. If convicted, the Grenons face up to life imprisonment. A federal district judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.Jonathan and Jordan Grenon have been detained since their arrest, based on a judge’s finding that they posed a risk of nonappearance at future court proceedings and a danger to the community if released. They are scheduled to be arraigned on Monday, April 26, 2021, at 10:00 a.m., in federal magistrate court in Miami. Mark and Joseph Grenon are presently in Colombia.Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Juan Antonio Gonzalez and Assistant Commissioner of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations Catherine Hermsen announced the charges.FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations investigated the case.

Wolf to 42 months in prison and three years of supervised release. In May 2019, Langlois pleaded guilty to one count of tampering with a consumer product and one count of acquiring a controlled substance by deception and subterfuge.“The idea of taking desperately needed medication from a patient facing the last days and hours of life is horrifying and obviously violates legal and ethical duties,” said Acting United States Attorney Nathaniel R. Mendell. “The defendant abandoned his profession and abused his position of trust to exploit patients in their final moments.  The public can trust that my office will prosecute people who do this.”“Health care professionals who steal needed medications from patients put patients at increased risk of harm and disrupt the legal drug supply chain,” said Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey J. Ebersole, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, New York Field Office. “We will continue to protect the public health and bring to justice health care professionals who take advantage of their unique position and compromise their patients’ health and comfort by tampering with needed drugs.”“As a registered nurse, Langlois was entrusted with the care of sick and fragile patients. He brazenly and dangerously violated that trust at the expense of his patients by stealing morphine intended to comfort them during their most vulnerable moments,” said Phillip M. Coyne, Special Agent in Charge for the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “Today’s sentencing should serve as a strong reminder that we will spare no resources to bring to justice those who put patients in danger by tampering with drugs.”On Nov. 16, 2016, Langlois, then a registered nurse, tampered with bottles of liquid morphine that doctors had prescribed for two elderly hospice patients under his care at a Lowell nursing home. In each instance, Langlois took the liquid morphine, a schedule II narcotic used to treat pain, for his own use and then replaced it with saline or Benadryl in an attempt to cover up his crime. As a result of his conduct, the patients in Langlois’s care received a less potent dose of the painkiller than they had been prescribed.On or about April 3, 2017, Mr. Langlois diverted for his own use liquid morphine from a bottle prescribed to an elderly hospice patient under his care at a Melrose nursing home. To conceal his wrongful conduct, Mr. Langlois falsely represented in the medical file of one of his patients, and in the nursing home’s Medication Administration Record, that the liquid morphine for that patient was pure, when that was not in fact the case.Acting U.S. Attorney Mendell, FDA-OIC SAC Ebersole, HHS-OIG SAC Coyne and Monica Bharel, M.D., M.P.H., Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health made the announcement today.

Farley announced today.According to court documents and statements made in court, in November 2006, a federal grand jury charged BenMoshe with conspiracy to launder monetary instruments and conspiracy to engage in unlicensed wholesale distribution of prescription drugs.  Members of the conspiracy unlawfully purchased Serostrim (a drug for HIV and AIDS patients) from patients and then re-sold the drugs to wholesale drug distributors at a high profit.  As part of the conspiracy, the group created false drug pedigrees that suggested that the drugs had been obtained through legitimate distributors.After an initial appearance hearing in California on January 29, 2007, BenMoshe was released on conditions including his promise to notify the pretrial services officer of any plans to change his residence and to travel outside of the Central District of California and the District of New Hampshire.On January 9, 2009, BenMoshe pleaded guilty to conspiracy to engage in unlicensed wholesale distribution of prescription drugs. The Court accepted his guilty plea and permitted him to continue on the same conditions of release pending sentencing.  The sentencing hearing was scheduled for June 23, 2009.  On or about April 29, 2009, in violation of his conditions of release, BenMoshe moved to Israel and failed to appear for his sentencing hearing on June 23, 2009.On December 16, 2009, a federal grand jury charged BenMoshe with bail jumping for his failure to appear at his sentencing hearing.  In August 2020, BenMoshe was extradited from Israel to the United States to face the charges pending against him in New Hampshire.  He pleaded guilty to the bail jumping charge on January 27, 2021.The Court sentenced BenMoshe to 18 months in prison for the conspiracy offense and an additional 12 months for the bail jumping offense.  He will receive credit for the time he has been in custody prior to sentencing.“Mr. BenMoshe committed a serious federal crime by participating in an unlawful scheme involving prescription drugs and committed yet another federal crime by failing to appear for his sentencing hearing,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Farley.  “Although he fled from the United States, he was not able to avoid being held responsible for his criminal actions.  As this case demonstrates, those who fail to appear in court will be held accountable for their actions and will face additional federal prison time.”“U.S. consumers rely on FDA oversight to ensure that the drugs they receive are safe and effective. Improper distribution of prescription drugs of unknown origin put the health of all patients at significant risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey J. Ebersole, Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations’ New York Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who put the public’s health at risk.”“Mr. BenMoshe sought to enrich himself by engaging in illegal activity that may have put lives at risk,” said Phillip M. Coyne, Special Agent in Charge for the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  “His decision to flee the country only compounded his crime and the penalty that will ensue.”“The U.S. Marshals Service applauds the US Attorney’s Office and other law enforcement agencies, to include the Israeli government, who worked tirelessly to bring about this sentence, and we are proud to have been a partner in the furtherance of justice,” said Nick Willard, U.S. Marshal for the District of New Hampshire.The bail jumping matter was investigated by the U.S. Marshals Service.  The underlying criminal case was investigated by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation.  The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs assisted in securing BenMoshe’s extradition from Israel. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Cam Le and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Sarah Hawkins.###Component(s):USAO - New HampshirePress Release Number:21-063"

U.S. District Court Judge Richard G. Stearns scheduled sentencing for Aug. 5, 2021. Ceron was charged by criminal complaint and arrested in May 2019. A federal grand jury subsequently returned an indictment.From approximately 2004 to 2019, Ceron, who operated her business in Lawrence, performed illegal bodily injections using “gluteal material” that she obtained from a source in Florida. Lab tests of the material subsequently confirmed that it contained silicone oil – a substance that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns can travel through blood vessels and cause a stroke, death or permanent disfigurement.In 2018, Ceron agreed to perform buttock enhancing and facial injections for an individual. During a recorded meeting on May 24, 2018, Ceron told the individual that she charged $500 for buttock injections and $60 for each wrinkle-filling injection. A search of Ceron’s business in Lawrence the following month resulted in the seizure of several bottles and syringes of a substance that tests revealed to be silicone oil. Numerous uncapped, used syringes were also recovered from the business.Ceron performed illegal injections to augment the buttock or fill wrinkles of three other women in exchange for money and misled her victims about her qualifications and the identity and safety of the material she was injecting.The charging statute provides for a sentence on each count of up to three years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.Acting United States Attorney Nathaniel R. Mendell; Jeffrey J.

Brandler, the indictment alleges that Chunhasomboon sold unapproved chloroquine phosphate to customers worldwide, including in the United States, as a treatment for both COVID-19 and for malaria.  Chunhasomboon allegedly evaded and attempted to evade U.S. Customs inspectors by disguising his shipments of chloroquine phosphate as fish tank accessories and cell phone cases, among other things.  Chunhasomboon also allegedly undervalued the shipments to be worth only $10 to $12, when in fact they often were worth several hundred dollars each.  Chunhasomboon allegedly made tens of thousands of dollars from his scheme.Chloroquine phosphate is not approved by the FDA as a COVID-19 treatment, and previously was approved on an emergency basis only in controlled hospital settings and from approved sources. The CDC previously reported that two individuals who ingested chloroquine phosphate they obtained for treating aquarium fish did so as a prophylactic measure against COVID-19.  One of those individuals died, and one was left critically ill.Chunhasomboon is charged with two counts of mail fraud and three counts of wire fraud for selling chloroquine phosphate to four customers located in Pennsylvania.  He also is charged with two counts of smuggling chloroquine phosphate into the United States, two counts of introducing misbranded drugs into U.S. commerce, and two counts of introducing unapproved new drugs into U.S. commerce.  Chunhasomboon further is charged with two counts of making false statements to federal agents, denying that he sold chloroquine phosphate as either a treatment for COVID-19 or for malaria.The case was investigated by Homeland Security Investigations, with assistance from the Food and Drug Administration.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Phillip J. Caraballo is prosecuting the case.Criminal indictments are only allegations. All persons charged are presumed to be innocent unless and until found guilty in court.A sentence following a finding of guilt is imposed by the Judge after consideration of the applicable federal sentencing statutes and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.The maximum penalty under federal law for the most serious offenses is 20 years of imprisonment, a term of supervised release following imprisonment, and a fine. Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the Judge is also required to consider and weigh a number of factors, including the nature, circumstances and seriousness of the offense; the history and characteristics of the defendant; and the need to punish the defendant, protect the public and provide for the defendant's educational, vocational and medical needs. For these reasons, the statutory maximum penalty for the offense is not an accurate indicator of the potential sentence for a specific defendant.# # #Topic(s):CoronavirusComponent(s):USAO - Pennsylvania, Middle"

Bubar announced.Leedy, 31, pleaded guilty to one count of tampering with a consumer product (fentanyl and  hydromorphone) that affects interstate commerce with reckless disregard for the risk that another person will be placed in danger of death or bodily injury. At sentencing, Leedy faces a maximum possible sentence of up to ten years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.“When Leedy tampered with fentanyl and hydromorphone, he put patients’ care at risk, violated the trust we place in our health care workers, and committed a serious crime,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Bubar today.  “I applaud the good work carried out by FDA and the Virginia State Police to ensure the public receives unadulterated medication.”According to court documents, from November 2018 to June 2019, Leedy tampered with at least 50 vials of fentanyl and hydromorphone while working at Centra Lynchburg General Hospital and as an Emergency Medical Services (EMS) worker for Roanoke County Emergency Medical Services.On May 16, 2019, a Roanoke City EMS ambulance crew member discovered a suspected tampered vial of fentanyl while on an EMS call. When he attempted to administer the vial to a patient, he noticed the cap was not secured and believed the vial has been tampered with. Further investigation revealed that Leedy had tampered with the vial by removing the fentanyl and replacing it with saline.A supervisor with the Roanoke County EMS queried the access card database and determined that Leedy had been accessing the rescue squad building at night, while he was not working, to take the fentanyl.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of TexasFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, March 25, 2021HOUSTON - Two citizens of Ukraine have been sentenced after admitting they conspired to smuggle and distribute counterfeit cancer and hepatitis drugs into the United States.Maksym Nienadov, 36, is the owner of the Ukrainian-based company Healthy Nation. He and his co-conspirator and employee – Volodymyr Nikolaienko, 34 – pleaded guilty to conspiracy, trafficking in counterfeit drugs and smuggling goods into the United States July 17, 2020. Nienadov also admitted to introducing misbranded medicine into the United States.Today, Nienadov and Nikolaienko were sentenced to respective terms of 71 and 33 months in federal prison. They are both expected to face removal proceedings following the prison terms.“The defendants sought to profit off the illnesses of others, selling false hope – including fake drugs with no active ingredient – and risking the health of vulnerable patients,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “This prosecution makes clear that we will hold accountable those who disregard the risks to patients by smuggling counterfeit drugs into the United States.”“Those that traffic counterfeit drugs pose harm to our country’s most vulnerable citizens and will face consequences,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Jennifer B. Lowery. “Defenseless people need their medications for life-threatening illnesses. Schemes like these put patients at risk of not receiving the actual drugs required for treatment. This prosecution demonstrates the tremendous work by all our partners and our collaborative commitment to protecting our community and combatting counterfeit drug trafficking into the United States.”In June 2018, undercover U.S. authorities began communicating with Nienadov about the illegal sale of Keytruda. This prompted a months-long exchange which also involved Nikolaienko and resulted in the unlawful sale of counterfeit or unapproved Keytruda, Abraxane and Epclusa. Neither Nienadov nor Nikolaienko are medical doctors, pharmacists or licensed pharmaceutical wholesalers in the United States and did not have authorization to sell the drugs.Merck & Co. manufactures Keytruda, a medicine to treat cancer, while Gilead Sciences Inc. manufactures Epclusa, a prescription drug for the treatment of hepatitis-C. Celgene Corporation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol Myers Squibb and manufactures the oncology product Abraxane. In their legitimate form, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved all three drugs for distribution in the United States.During the undercover investigation, law enforcement received Nienadov’s banking information, which included the name “Maksim Nenadov” and his Ukrainian bank account number. Authorities transferred $2,400 to his bank account for the purchase of the purported Keytruda. Soon after, they received a shipment from “Maxim Nenadov” which contained two boxes represented to contain Keytruda. However, the items were sent to Merck for testing and determined to be counterfeit.Authorities then negotiated the purchase of more Keytruda as well as an another medication, Abraxane. The online messaging and email conversations resulted in a $3,400 undercover payment to Nienadov for the purchase of both drugs. On July 30, 2018, “Maxim Nenadov” sent two boxes of 50 mg purported Keytruda and two boxes of supposed Abraxane 5 mg/ml to undercover agents. Merck and Celgene performed analyses and confirmed the packaging and medication to be counterfeit.In late 2018, law enforcement also negotiated the undercover purchase of two boxes of purported Epclusa tablets from Nienadov and Nikolaienko for $6,000. Gilead identified the packaging and contents as counterfeit.“Selling illegal prescription drugs in the U.S. marketplace puts consumers’ health at risk, but it is especially reprehensible when the drugs are intended for use with especially vulnerable populations, such as cancer patients,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L. Grinstead of the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI) - Kansas City Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who sell illegal prescription drugs, knowing that they can jeopardize patients’ health.”“We work tirelessly, alongside our federal partners and private sector stakeholders, to prevent counterfeit pharmaceuticals from infiltrating the American marketplace,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Houston. “Today’s sentencing is another example of our relentless efforts to ensure consumers are receiving the life-saving pharmaceuticals that they need to treat their afflictions.”Nienadov and Nikolaienko were taken into custody April 18, 2019, after they arrived in the United States from Ukraine to discuss future unlawful shipments of pharmaceuticals. They have been and will remain in custody pending transfer to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future.HSI and FDA-OCI conducted the investigation.Assistant U.S. Attorney Sebastian Edwards and Senior Trial Attorney Jeffrey Pearlman of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) prosecuted the case.

Bencosme is the second defendant to be sentenced in connection with the scheme. On March 5, 2021, Lisett Raventos, 46, of Miami, was sentenced to 30 months in prison after also pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud.Bencosme was a licensed medical doctor who served as the primary investigator for clinical trials purportedly conducted at Unlimited Medical Research. Raventos was the site director, the director of clinical operations, and a study coordinator at the clinic. In pleading guilty, Bencosme and Raventos admitted that they participated in a scheme to defraud an unnamed pharmaceutical company by fabricating the data and participation of subjects in a clinical trial at Unlimited Medical Research.The clinical trial was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of an asthma medication in children between the ages of four and 11. Bencosme and Raventos admitted that they falsified medical records to make it appear as though pediatric subjects made scheduled visits to Unlimited Medical Research, took study drugs as required, and received checks as payment. In sentencing Raventos, U.S. District Judge Beth Bloom said that if the defendants’ actions had been left unchecked, the scheme “could have negatively impacted the treatment and well-being of children with asthma throughout the country.”“Falsifying clinical trial data risks the health of those who might later rely on the drugs being tested,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department of Justice will continue working with its partners at the Food and Drug Administration to investigate and prosecute anyone who endangers the public for personal gain.”“Clinical trials are an essential part of the medical research process, as they ensure the effectiveness and safety to patients of new drugs,” said U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan for the Southern District of Florida. “Those who manipulate clinical data risk the public’s health and such criminal behavior will be prosecuted.”“FDA’s evaluation of a new drug begins with an analysis of reliable and accurate data from clinical trials. Compromised clinical trial data could impact the agency’s decisions about the safety and effectiveness of the drug under review,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin C. Fielder of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations, Miami Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those whose actions may subvert the FDA drug approval process and put the public health at risk.”Another defendant in the case, Maytee Lledo, pleaded guilty in February 2021 to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. She is scheduled to be sentenced on April 16, 2021, in Miami.Trial Attorneys Joshua Rothman and Kara M. Traster of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch are prosecuting the case.

As part of a criminal resolution with the Department of Justice, FKOL agreed to plead guilty to the misdemeanor offense. U.S. District Judge Jennifer A. Dorsey accepted the company’s guilty plea and sentenced FKOL to pay a criminal fine of $30 million, forfeit an additional $20 million, and implement a compliance and ethics program designed to prevent, detect, and correct violations of U.S. law relating to FKOL’s manufacture of cancer drugs intended for terminally ill patients.“By concealing and destroying drug manufacturing records, FKOL undermined FDA’s regulatory authority and placed vulnerable consumers at risk,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “Today’s sentence holds the company accountable for its past conduct and seeks to ensure it will fully comply with its obligations to the FDA going forward.”According to court documents, FKOL owned and operated a manufacturing plant in Kalyani, West Bengal, India, that manufactured active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) used in various cancer drug products distributed to the United States. Prior to a January 2013 FDA inspection of the Kalyani facility, FKOL plant management directed employees to remove certain records from the premises and delete other records from computers that would have revealed FKOL was manufacturing drug ingredients in contravention of FDA requirements. Kalyani plant employees removed computers, hardcopy documents, and other materials from the plant and deleted spreadsheets that contained evidence of the plant’s noncompliant practices.“Today’s sentencing reflects our office’s and the department’s commitment to holding accountable companies that disregard FDA regulations, at the risk of consumers’ health and safety,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Christopher Chiou for the District of Nevada. “Together with our agency partners, we will continue to ensure that drug manufacturers fully comply with their obligations to maintain the integrity of records and data.”“FDA inspections of pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities help ensure the strength, quality and purity of our medicines,” said Judy McMeekin, Pharm.D., Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs of the FDA. “Today’s sentencing proves that we will continue to aggressively investigate and bring to justice those who attempt to subvert requirements that protect the public health.”The FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Los Angeles Field Office, investigated the case. The Central Bureau of Investigation in India provided invaluable assistance to U.S. authorities in the investigation of this matter.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeNorthern District of TexasFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, March 19, 2021Fourteen defendants convicted in the Forest Park Medical Center bribery scam have been sentenced to a combined 74+ years in federal prison and ordered to pay a total of $82.9 million in restitution, announced Acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas Prerak Shah.Seven defendants – Wilton McPherson “Mac” Burt, Jackson Jacob, Douglas Sung Won, Michael Bassem Rimlawi, Shawn Mark Henry, Mrugeshkumar Shah, and Iris Kathleen Forrest – were convicted at trial in April 2019, and were sentenced this week by U.S. District Judge Zack Zouhary. Ten other defendants pleaded guilty prior to trial, and one, who was granted a mistrial, pleaded guilty after trial.“Patient needs, not physician finances, should dictate where, when, and how patients are treated. Money should never be allowed to influence medical decisions,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Prerak Shah. “We believe the stiff sentences handed down this week send a strong deterrent message: Violate anti-kickback laws, and you will face consequences.”The $200 million scheme was designed to induce doctors to steer lucrative patients – particularly those with high-reimbursing, out-of-network private insurance – to the now defunct hospital.Most of the kickbacks, which totaled more than $40 million, were disguised as consulting fees or “marketing money” doled as a percentage of surgeries each doctor referred to Forest Park.Instead of billing patients for out-of-network co-payments, instituted by insurers to de-incentivize the high costs associated with out-of-network treatment, Forest Park allegedly assured patients they would pay in-network prices. Because they knew insurers wouldn’t tolerate such practices, they concealed the patient discounts and wrote off the difference as uncollected “bad debt.”Hospital manager Alan AndrewBeauchamp– who pleaded guilty in August 2018 to one count of conspiracy to pay healthcare bribes and one count of commercial bribery under the Travel Act, then testified for the government during his coconspirators’ trial – admitted that Forest Park “bought surgeries,” and then “papered it up to make it look good.” Mr. Beauchamp was sentenced Friday afternoon to 63 months in federal prison.Other defendants were sentenced as follows:• Wilton “Mac”Burt, Forest Park’s managing partner, was found guilty on 10 of 12 counts, including one count of conspiracy, two counts of paying kickbacks, six counts of commercial bribery in violation of the Travel Act, and one count of money laundering. He was sentenced Wednesday to 150 months in federal prison.• JacksonJacob, owner of the shell companies through which some of the bribes were routed, was found guilty on four of 14 counts, including conspiracy and three counts of paying kickbacks. He was sentenced Wednesday to 96 months in federal prison.• Dr. DouglasWon, a spinal surgeon, was found guilty on one of two counts, conspiracy. He was sentenced Thursday to 60 months in federal prison.• Dr. MichaelRimlawi, a spinal surgeon who partnered with Won, was found guilty on three of four counts, including conspiracy and two counts of receiving kickbacks. He was sentenced Thursday to 90 months in federal prison.• Dr. ShawnHenry, a spinal surgeon who invested in FMPC, was found guilty on three of three counts, including conspiracy, commercial bribery, and money laundering. He was sentenced Wednesday to 90 months in federal prison.• Dr. MrugeshkumarShah, a pain management doctor, was found guilty on four of four counts, including conspiracy, two counts of paying kickbacks, and one count of commercial bribery. He was sentenced Thursday to 42 months in federal prison.• IrisForrest, a nurse who recruited and preauthorized worker’s comp requests, was convicted on two of two counts, including conspiracy and paying kickbacks. She was sentenced Wednesday to 36 months in federal prison.• IsraelOrtiz, the founder of Kortmed, a company that fills out preauthorization for worker’s comp patients, pleaded guilty in February 2017 to conspiracy to pay and receive healthcare kickbacks. He was sentenced Thursday to 12 months in federal prison.• Dr. Wade NealBarker, a bariatric surgeon who co-founded Forest Park in 2008, pleaded guilty in October 2018 to one count of conspiracy to pay health care bribes and one count of paying illegal remuneration in violation of the Travel Act. He was sentenced Thursday to 60 months in federal prison.• Andrew JonathanHillman, a co-owner of Hospital Business Concepts, a surgeon brokerage,  pleaded guilty in October 2018 to conspiracy to pay and receive healthcare bribes. He was sentenced in December 2019 to 60 months in federal prison.• Dr. FrankGonzalez, a chiropractor who referred patients to Forest Park in return for bribes, pleaded guilty in August 2018 to conspiracy to pay and receive healthcare kickbacks. He was sentenced Friday to 21 months in federal prison.• SemyonNarosov, a co-owner of Hospital Business Concepts, pleaded guilty in October 2018 to conspiracy to pay and receive healthcare bribes. He was sentenced in July 2020 to 51 months in federal prison.• Dr. RichardToussaintJr., an anesthesiologist who co-founded Forest Park in 2008, pleaded guilty in March 2017 to one count of conspiracy to pay health care bribes and one count of paying illegal remuneration in violation of the Travel Act. He was sentenced in August 2020 to 60 months in federal prison.• Carli AdelHempel, who pleaded guilty in July 2019 to conspiracy to misapply property of a health care benefit program, was sentenced in October 2020 to three years’ probation.• Kelly WadeLoterand Andrea KaySmith, who both  pleaded guilty to misprision of a felony (failure to report a felony), were sentenced in January 2020 to three and five years’ probation, respectively.The Forest Park prosecution is one of the first cases in the nation to use the federal Travel Act to prosecute healthcare fraud.The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Department of Labor Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Labor Employee Benefits Security Administration, the U.S. Department of Defense - Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Office of Inspector General, and Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, with assistance from the Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.

Brennan. “The Department of Justice and our partner agencies will continue to protect the health of the public by ensuring critical regulatory functions, such as this, continue unabated.”“Federal law requires that dietary supplement manufacturers follow good manufacturing practice to ensure, among other things, that their products contain the labeled ingredients and are not contaminated with harmful or undesirable substances. FDA inspection of these facilities is critical to determining adherence to these regulations and manufacturers who refuse FDA oversight put the public at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office. “We will continue to monitor, investigate and bring to justice dietary supplement firms that ignore these important safety requirements.”According to court documents, Cotterill and Sanor also operated Genesis Herb Private Membership Association, an organization with trustees located in the Northern District of Ohio that distributed dietary supplements to its members.On September 22, 2016, December 13, 2017 and April 18, 2018, investigators with the FDA obtained a Warrant for Administrative Inspection for the Genesis Herb Company manufacturing facility site in Monroeville and Canton. On each occasion, investigators attempted to conduct an inspection at the Monroeville facility and were denied access by Shaun Cotterill.Cotterill initially allowed the inspection of storage areas and out-buildings that contained items such as boxes, packaging materials, shipping labels, invoices and more. However, Cotterill refused to provide access to the areas where the dietary supplements were manufactured and stored on each occasion.Additionally, Cotterill refused to provide access to manufacturing records required to be kept regulation governing the operation of by Genesis Herb. At each instance, Cotterill was told by an investigator that these refusals would constitute a refusal of inspection. Cotterill claimed he understood, and the inspections were terminated.According to the Bill of Information and details presented in court proceedings, from September of 2016 through June of 2020, Cotterill and Sanor pleaded guilty to introducing into interstate commerce dietary supplements manufactured, processed, packed, and held in a factory, warehouse, or establishment that did not meet required manufacturing practices.In addition, Cotterill and Sanor admitted to failing to renew a registration for Genesis Herb Company as a food manufacturing facility and never registering Genesis Herb Private Membership Association with the FDA as a food facility.This case was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations.  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Freeman.Topic(s):Consumer ProtectionComponent(s):USAO - Ohio, NorthernContact:Daniel BallDaniel.Ball@usdoj.gov"

The charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.“This case highlights the self-destructive power of addiction and the lengths to which those struggling with substance use disorder will go,” stated U.S. Attorney Kennedy. “This defendant took medications intended to treat cancer patients to feed her own addiction, hurting those who were seriously ill or dying. This case illustrates just how widespread and devastating the damage caused by a one person’s addiction can be.”“The FDA oversees the U.S. drug supply to ensure that it is safe and effective, and those who tamper with medicines put patients’ health at risk,” said Special Agent-in-Charge Jeffrey J. Ebersole, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, New York Field Office. “We will continue to protect the public health and bring to justice health care professionals who take advantage of their unique positions and compromise patients’ health and comfort by criminally tampering with needed drugs.”“Kelsey Mulvey's plea today to tampering with powerful narcotics intended to ease the suffering of cancer patients here in Buffalo painfully resonates with the thousands of families who have personally faced the challenges and torment that comes with the crippling affliction of cancer,” said FBI Buffalo Field Office Special-Agent-in-Charge Stephen Belongia. “Although the pain of addiction takes its own toll on those who suffer from it, it cannot and does not excuse medical professionals who intentionally compromise the health and comfort of cancer patients who deserve to receive safe and unadulterated medication meant to ease their pain.”Assistant U.S. Attorney Misha A. Coulson, who is handling the case, stated that between July 21, 2016, and July 13, 2018, the defendant worked as a registered nurse at Roswell Park Comprehensive Center. Between February and June 2018, Mulvey tampered with and stole controlled medications, including Dilaudid, from various medication dispensing machines located throughout the hospital, which tracked and held controlled substances meant for Rowell Park patients. She did so to satisfy her addiction.Specifically, the defendant would conduct a transaction at a dispensing machine, quickly cancel the transaction and leave the medication drawer open, open the vial and remove the hydromorphone, replace it with water, and place the vial back into the machine so the total count of vials would not trigger scrutiny. Over time, Mulvey utilized the patient medical record database to search for patients specifically prescribed hydromorphone, because to access the dispensing machine, the defendant had to first access patient profiles. At times, Mulvey would divert vials of controlled medications from the dispensing machine and not administer the medication to any patient.On June 27, 2018, the defendant had a scheduled vacation day, however, she was observed accessing a dispensing machine, carrying a backpack, and exiting a medication room in which she was not assigned. It was later determined that Mulvey had accessed the drawer for hydromorphone. The defendant was subsequently placed on administrative leave and resigned in lieu of termination.From June to July 2018, there was a spate of waterborne infections at Roswell Park, during which six patients became ill. An investigation by the hospital concluded that tampering of compounded hydromorphone vials was the cause. On June 27, 2018, seven hydromorphone vials were removed from the dispensing machines, which were involved in the defendant’s conduct. Four out of seven grew the waterborne bacteria and had approximately 80% of the hydromorphone removed and replaced. Roswell Park tested another set of vials and concluded that three out of four vials had a substantial percentage of hydromorphone removed and replaced and waterborne bacteria.The plea is the culmination of an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey Ebersole; the Federal Bureau of Investigation, under the direction of Special Agent-in-Charge Stephen Belongia; the New York State Department of Education, Office of Professional Discipline; and the New York State Attorney General’s Office, under the direction of Attorney General Letitia James.Sentencing will be scheduled at a later date.# # # #"

ROBINSON pled guilty to a one-count Information on September 16, 2020, before U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken, who also imposed today’s sentence.U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: “Scott Robinson created and profited from a system designed to exploit racehorses in the pursuit of speed and prize money, risking their safety and wellbeing. Robinson sold unsanitary, misbranded, and adulterated drugs, and misled and deceived regulators and law enforcement in the process.”According to the Indictment, the Superseding Information to which ROBINSON pled guilty, and other court documents, as well as statements made in public court proceedings:From at least in or about 2011 through at least in or about March 2020, ROBINSON conspired with others to manufacture, sell, and ship millions of dollars’ worth of adulterated and misbranded equine drugs, including performance-enhancing drugs (“PEDs”) intended to be administered to racehorses for the purpose of improving those horses’ race performances in order to win races and obtain prize money. ROBINSON sold these drugs through several direct-to-consumer websites designed to appeal to racehorse trainers and owners, including, among others, “horseprerace.com.”ROBINSON contributed to the conspiracy by, among other things, sourcing chemicals used to create custom PEDs that were advertised and sold; falsely labeling, packaging, and shipping those PEDs to customers across the country, including in the Southern District of New York; and collecting, reporting, and responding to employee and customer complaints regarding the misbranded and adulterated products advertised and sold online. Among the drugs advertised and sold during the course of the conspiracy were “blood builders,” which are used by racehorse trainers and others to increase red blood cell counts and/or the oxygenation of muscle tissue of a racehorse in order to stimulate the horse’s endurance, which enhances that horse’s performance in, and recovery from, a race, as well as customized analgesics that are used by racehorse trainers and others to deaden a horse’s nerves and block pain in order to improve a horse’s race performance. The drugs distributed through the defendant’s websites were manufactured in non-FDA registered facilities and carried significant risks to the animals affected through the administration of those illicit PEDs. For example, in 2016, ROBINSON received a complaint regarding the effect of his unregulated drugs on a customer’s horse: “starting bout 8 hours after I give the injection and for about 36 hours afterwards both my horses act like they are heavily sedated, can barely walk. Could I have a bad bottle of medicine, I’m afraid to give it anymore since this has happened three times.” Commenting on this complaint, ROBINSON wrote simply, “here is another one.”*                *                *In addition to his prison sentence, ROBINSON, 46, of Tampa, Florida, was sentenced to three years of supervised release and forfeiture of $3,832,318.90.Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the New York FBI Office’s Eurasian Organized Crime Task Force and its support of the FBI’s Integrity in Sports and Gaming Initiative. Ms. Strauss also thanked the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office, the New York State Police, and the New York City Police Department for their support of this investigation, and the Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration for their assistance and expertise.This case is being handled by the Office’s Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit.

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEMonday, March 8,2021In an indictment unsealed today, a federal grand jury in Miami charged a Florida medical doctor and three others for their roles in an alleged scheme to falsify clinical trial data.According to court documents, Dr. Martin Valdes, 64, of Coral Gables, Florida, Fidalgis Font, 53, of Miami, Julio Lopez, 54, of Miami, and Duniel Tejeda, 35, of Canon City, Colorado, were charged in a six-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury on Feb. 23, 2021. Each defendant was charged with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and at least one substantive count of mail fraud. In addition, Valdes and Font were charged with money laundering and Valdes was further charged with making a false statement to inspectors with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).“The public must be able to rely on the accuracy and honesty of clinical trial data, which is essential to ensuring the safety of drugs approved for patient use,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The defendants undermined that process and put patients at risk. The Department of Justice will pursue and prosecute those who put personal profit before public health.”According to the indictment, from at least February 2014 through at least July 2016, the defendants fabricated clinical trial data for profit while working at Tellus Clinical Research, a medical clinic based in Miami. The indictment alleges that the defendants knowingly enrolled subjects in clinical trials when those subjects failed to meet eligibility criteria, falsified subject laboratory results, falsified subject medical records, and falsely represented that subjects were taking the drugs being studied when in fact they were not. Valdes served as primary investigator for the clinical trials conducted at Tellus, Font was the owner of the business, and Lopez and Tejeda were senior Tellus employees.“Reliable and accurate data from clinical trials is the cornerstone of FDA’s evaluation of a new drug,” said Catherine A. Hermsen, FDA Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations. “Compromised clinical trial data could impact the agency’s decisions about the safety and effectiveness of the drug under review. We will continue to monitor, investigate and bring to justice those whose actions may subvert the FDA approval process and endanger the public health.”“Falsifying clinical data is a violation of the public’s trust and it endangers the safety of consumers,” said Ariana Fajardo Orshan, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. “Those who enrich themselves while compromising public health in this way commit serious crimes and will be prosecuted.”If convicted of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud or mail fraud, each defendant faces a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment. If convicted of money laundering, Valdes faces a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment, and Font faces a maximum of 10 years’ imprisonment. If convicted of making a false statement to the FDA, Valdes faces a maximum of five years’ imprisonment. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.Assistant Director Clint Narver, Trial Attorney Lauren M. Elfner, and Trial Attorney Joshua Rothman of the Justice Department’s Consumer Protection Branch are prosecuting the case. The FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, Miami Field Office, investigated the case, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of Florida provided critical assistance.Additional information about the Consumer Protection Branch and its enforcement efforts may be found atwww.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch.

They are expected to make their initial appearances before U.S. Magistrate Judge Andrew Edison at 2 p.m.The eight-count indictment alleges Mokbel is the owner of several Houston area pharmacies, while Elsafty is his accountant.4M Pharmaceuticals Inc. was the parent company for several retail pharmacies that operated in Houston, Fort Worth, South Florida and elsewhere, according to the charges. Mokbel was 4M’s CEO and allegedly had ownership interests in the subsidiary pharmacies. The charges allege Elsafty served as 4M’s accountant and tax preparer as well as nominee owner of the multiple pharmacies.4M Pharmaceuticals allegedly functioned as an outbound telemarketing call center that solicited Medicare, Medicaid and commercial insurance patients nationwide – many over the over the age of 55. The indictment alleges call center employees offered patients medically unnecessary diabetic supplies and topical creams although many refused the solicitations. However, 4M Pharmaceuticals and pharmacies allegedly billed the patient’s insurance plan anyway. In some cases, 4M pharmacies billed for prescriptions dispensed after a patient’s death, according to the allegations.The scheme also allegedly targeted doctors. The charges allege 4M Pharmaceuticals sent fax requests for prescriptions that patients often did not authorize. In several cases, the company billed patients for prescription drugs without a valid prescription, according to the allegations. 4M pharmacies also allegedly sent prescription requests to doctors for dead patients.In several instances, audits required 4M to produce paperwork, according to the indictment. ElSafty allegedly participated in fabricating records.The indictment alleges that from Dec. 13, 2013, through March 3, 2020, 4M pharmacies collectively received over $134 million in payments from Medicare and other healthcare benefit programs based on fraudulent claims. The funds were allegedly used, in part, to pay for Mokbel’s $1.5 million residence, $15 million in gambling and casino expenses and purchases and payments for a Ferrari and a Bentley automobile. Mokbel also transferred and controlled over $6 million in health care fraud proceeds in certificate of deposit accounts at banks, according to the allegations.Mokbel and ElSafty are charged with one count of a conspiracy to commit health care fraud, three counts of health care fraud and four counts of money laundering. All carry a possible prison sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 maximum fine.

Acting United States Attorney Daniel P. Bubar and Virginia Attorney General Mark G. Herring made the announcement today.Dube, 59, of Johnson City Tenn., previously pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Abingdon to two felony counts of health care fraud (one filed in the Western District of Virginia and one filed in the Eastern District of Kentucky).“Michael Dube took advantage of health care funds, aimed at helping the most vulnerable, for his own greed,” Acting U.S. Attorney Bubar said today. “Today’s significant sentence demonstrates that health care fraud will not be tolerated, and is the product of close partnership between federal, state, and local law enforcement, whose collaboration brought the Dubes to justice.”“Addressing the opioid crisis is an issue of great concern for our nation and remains a top public health priority for the FDA. It is crucial that treatment providers act with honesty and integrity in combatting the crisis,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Metro Washington Field Office. “In cooperation with our federal and state law enforcement partners, we will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who defraud federal programs.”According to court documents, in March 2011, Michael Dube pleaded guilty in the Eastern District of Tennessee to one count of intentionally omitting information from reports as required under the Controlled Substances Act. As a result of his conviction, the Department of Health and Human Services [HHS] informed Dube in a letter dated June 29, 2012, that he was excluded from participating in any federal health care program.Nonetheless, in May 2013, Michael and his wife, Regan Dube, established American Toxicology Labs [ATL] in Johnson City, Tennessee, with Regan Dube serving as the company’s registered agent, and using the couple’s home address as the principal office and mailing address. ATL then applied to participate in Medicare and Medicaid. On the applications, Regan Dube was listed as the owner of ATL, and Michael Dube’s name and participation in ATL was omitted.ATL conducted urine screens for various entities who represented themselves to be opioid treatment facilities. Between May 1, 2014, and January 31, 2020, Medicare, Virginia Medicaid, Kentucky Medicaid and TennCare made payments to ATL that totaled approximately $8.5 million. During this time, Michael Dube made employment decisions, negotiated business arrangements with providers, and otherwise participated in the management of ATL.In addition, Michael Dube also received kickback payments from third parties for referring individuals to those third parties for services for which payment was made (in whole or in part) by federal health care programs. These payments were deposited in Michael and Regan Dube’s personal checking account in a total amount of $441,646. Regan Dube was previously convicted and sentenced in connection with the scheme.As a result of their convictions, Regan and Michael Dube will pay a total of $9,015,046, plus interest, divided between special assessments, fines, restitution, and forfeiture. They will have to repay all of the money they received from Medicare and Medicaid programs.The investigation of the case was conducted by the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, Virginia Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Virginia State Police, and Internal Revenue Service – Criminal Investigations, and the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.

Murray announced today.According to court documents and statements made in court, Coleman worked as a pharmacy technician for a retail pharmacy chain in Nashua.  In January 2019, she agreed to deliver two prescriptions to an elderly patient, which was not part of her ordinary job responsibilities.  After the delivery, the patient checked her bottles and discovered several pills were missing from her oxycodone prescription.  Further, some of the pills in the bottle were larger and had a different imprint than the others, and were later determined to be baclofen, a non-scheduled drug indicated as a muscle relaxant and anti-spasmodic agent. Coleman admitted to law enforcement officers that she replaced some of the oxycodone in the prescription bottle with the baclofen and gave the stolen oxycodone to a friend to sell, for which she received $80.Additional investigation revealed that Coleman had been stealing Suboxone from the pharmacy for her personal use. Coleman admitted that she had stolen a strip a day for approximately one year.Coleman previously pleaded guilty on October 20, 2020.“Drug diversion and tampering with consumer products are serious crimes that can endanger the lives of patients,” said U.S. Attorney Murray.  “When criminals steal controlled substances and replace them with other drugs, patients are deprived of needed medicine and could face other serious medical risks.  In order to protect the health and safety of our citizens, we take crimes like this seriously and will not hesitate to prosecute health care workers who steal drugs from innocent victims.”“Those who knowingly tamper with and steal medicines risk harming patients by depriving them of their prescribed therapies,” said Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey J.

Hall to one count of tampering with a consumer product.Pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), the court proceeding occurred via videoconference.According to court documents and statements made in court, Monticone was a nurse employed by the Yale Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility clinic (“Yale REI clinic”) in Orange.  As part of her responsibilities at the Yale REI, Monticone ordered and inventoried a variety of narcotics used by the clinic, including fentanyl, which is a component of a cohort of drugs used by Yale physicians during outpatient surgical procedures to anesthetize patients and protect them from feeling pain.In June 2020, Monticone began stealing fentanyl for her own use.  She accessed secure storage areas and took vials of fentanyl, used a syringe to withdraw the narcotics from the vials, and reinjected saline into vials so that it would appear as if none of the narcotics were missing.  The investigation revealed that approximately 75 percent of the fentanyl given to patients at the Yale REI clinic from June to October 2020 was adulterated with saline.  Some of the vials contained diluted fentanyl, while others contained no drug at all and contained just saline.In pleading guilty, Monticone admitted that knew that the adulterated vials of fentanyl she replaced at the Yale REI clinic would be used in surgical procedures, and that the absence of an anesthetic during an outpatient procedure may cause serious bodily injury to the patient.  Monticone further admitted that she initially injected herself with the fentanyl while working at the Yale REI clinic and eventually began taking the vials home.  She would refill the vials with sterile saline at home, bring them back to the clinic, and reintroduce them into the stock of fentanyl available for use during surgical procedures.  On approximately November 1, 2020, Monticone brought approximately 175 vials of fentanyl that she had taken from the Yale REI clinic and discarded them in waste containers at the clinic.Judge Hall scheduled sentencing for May 25, 2021, at which time Monticone faces a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years.Monticone is released on a $50,000 bond pending sentencing.  She has surrendered her nursing license.This matter is being investigated by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations; the DEA’s New Haven Tactical Diversion Squad; and the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection, Drug Control Division.  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Ray Miller.Topic(s):Consumer ProtectionOpioidsPrescription DrugsComponent(s):USAO - Connecticut"

Momin a/k/a Saguftabanu Momin, husband and wife, have been sentenced to prison for naturalization fraud and conspiring to illegally import and distribute misbranded drug products from China and traffic counterfeit goods. The Momins have also been criminally denaturalized as result of their convictions for naturalization fraud.“The defendants built their business and earned their citizenship through fraud,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Kurt R. Erskine. “And, by illegally importing and distributing products containing drugs that can only be obtained in the United States with a prescription written by a licensed medical professional, the Momins put profit over public safety.”“This announcement demonstrates that those who subvert the regulatory functions of the FDA by distributing misbranded drugs containing undeclared prescription drug ingredients and counterfeit tobacco products will be held accountable for their actions,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin C. Fielder, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Miami Field Office. “We will continue to bring to justice those who place American consumers at risk by selling these illegal and potentially dangerous products.”“The Momins lived a life of lies in this country from their fraudulent citizenship to their business of selling illegal products to customers whose health was threatened by the use of those products,” said Chris Hacker, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. “Now they will pay for their deception in prison time and loss of their citizenship. The FBI is committed to working with our federal partners to protect our citizens against anyone who would choose to do them harm.”“The Momins will now face the consequences of their lies and schemes to illegally gain citizenship and import and sell misbranded pharmaceuticals. Their actions not only placed unsuspecting purchasers at risk, they also threatened the integrity of the US immigration system,” said Special Agent in Charge Katrina W. Berger, who oversees Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) operations in Georgia and Alabama. “Homeland Security Investigations and its law enforcement partners will aggressively pursue those that seek to profit from these fraudulent and dangerous activities.”According to Acting U.S. Attorney Erskine, the charges and other information presented in court: Between August 2014 and November 2018, the Momins ordered and sold male enhancement products from China marketed under various names.  These products contained sildenafil, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viagra, and/or tadalafil, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Cialis. Both Viagra and Cialis can be obtained in the U.S. only with a prescription from a doctor.The Momins had in fact received more than a dozen notices from the FDA advising them to not sell these products. The FDA has also warned consumers for more than half-a-decade to not purchase or use such “all natural” sexual products because they could have serious side effects, especially in men who are taking nitrates and suffer from diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease.In order to evade import restrictions, the Momins’ China-based suppliers mislabeled the boxes containing the illegal pills to make it appear that the boxes contained items that can be legally imported into the U.S., such as beauty products, health products, and health supplies. The Momins admitted to selling between $550,000 and $1.5 million in illegal drug products over the course of the conspiracy. They also sold various counterfeit goods from their warehouse in Dalton, Georgia, including counterfeit designer watches, headphones, e-cigarette devices, and tobacco rolling papers.Earlier, in October 2013, the Momins both applied to become naturalized U.S. citizens. On his application form, Irfanali Momin falsely stated that he had never been married before and did not disclose that he had in fact been married to two women at the same time. During an interview with USCIS in June 2014, Irfanali Momin made the same false declarations. Based upon his false statements, Irfanali Momin became a naturalized U.S. citizen on August 16, 2014. On her application form, Shiba I. Momin a/k/a Saguftabanu Momin, falsely stated that she did not go by any other names when in fact she knew that her actual name was Shiba I. Momin, but she was only passing as Saguftabanu Momin. The investigation had revealed that Shiba I.

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, February 19,2021A federal court in Texas sentenced a former dietary supplement company executive to prison for his role in fraudulently selling popular workout supplements, the Justice Department announced today.On Feb. 19, 2021, U.S. District Judge Sam A. Lindsay sentenced former S.K. Laboratories Vice President Sitesh Patel, 37, of Irvine, California, to 41 months’ imprisonment and one year of supervised release. The court previously ordered Patel’s former company, S.K. Laboratories, to forfeit $6 million in connection with the case.According to documents filed in the case, Patel played a key role in developing and manufacturing the popular workout and weight loss supplements known as Jack3d and OxyElite Pro, which were distributed by Dallas-based USPlabs. In pleading guilty in 2019 to conspiracy to introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce, Patel and several of his co-defendants admitted that they imported substances with false and misleading labeling to avoid law enforcement and regulatory agency attention. Patel also pleaded guilty to introduction of misbranded food into interstate commerce. The misbranding charges relate in part to OxyElite Pro, which was recalled in 2013 in the wake of an investigation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) into whether the supplement caused liver injuries in consumers. An indictment returned by a Dallas federal grand jury in 2015 against Patel and four other individuals associated with USPlabs alleged that the defendants sold some of their products without determining whether they would be safe to use.“Consumers should not have to question whether the dietary supplements they find on store shelves will cause them physical harm,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. “This case demonstrates the department’s commitment to working with our agency partners to prosecute individuals and companies that defraud the public and place consumers at risk.”“Dietary supplement manufacturers must not be allowed to mislead the public about untested ingredients mixed into their products,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Prerak Shah for the Northern District of Texas. “We are proud to hold this defendant accountable for lying to the public about ingredients that had the potential to cause them harm.”“FDA regulation of the manufacturing and distribution of dietary supplements helps ensure the safety of American consumers. Illegal schemes to subvert FDA’s oversight and trick the public into buying a product that does not meet FDA standards create a serious threat to public health,” said Judy McMeekin, Pharm.D., FDA’s Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs. “We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to investigate and bring to justice those who put profits ahead of the health of U.S. consumers.”“The defendant knowingly profited by deceiving American consumers, causing harm to them by concealing the true ingredients of a product intended to improve the very health it damaged,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Mark Pearson of the IRS-Criminal Investigation, Dallas Field Office. “Working to prosecute those people and institutions who endanger consumers is something the IRS-CI is dedicated to continuing to pursue with our partners in law enforcement.”The court previously sentenced Jacobo Geissler, 44, of University Park, Texas, the CEO of USPlabs, to 60 months’ imprisonment, and Jonathan Doyle, 41, of Dallas, the president of USPlabs, to 24 months’ imprisonment for their roles in the fraud. The court also sentenced defendants Cyril Willson, 40, of Ralston, Nebraska, a former consultant for USPlabs, and Matthew Hebert, 42, of Dallas, a co-owner of the company, to 18 months’ and 15 months’ imprisonment, respectively. In addition, USPlabs was ordered to pay $4.7 million in criminal forfeiture.The case was investigated by Special Agent Chad Medaris of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations and Special Agent Larissa Wilson of the IRS-Criminal Investigation. The case was prosecuted by Trial Attorneys David Sullivan, Patrick Runkle, and Raquel Toledo with the Consumer Protection Branch of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Errin Martin and John DelaGarza of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas.Additional information about the Consumer Protection Branch and its enforcement efforts may be found athttp://www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch.

SARMs are synthetic chemicals designed to mimic the effects of testosterone and other anabolic steroids.The FDA has long warned against the use of SARMs like those found in MedFit products, including stating in a publicly available 2017 warning letter to another firm that SARMs have been linked to life-threatening reactions including liver toxicity, and have the potential to increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. In connection with his sentence, Parks also forfeited $350,000.“Bypassing the FDA drug approval process puts consumers at risk,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The department will continue to work with the FDA to investigate and prosecute the illegal distribution of supplements that contain dangerous ingredients.”“When Parks marketed drugs masquerading as dietary supplements that had not been approved by the FDA, he sidestepped important safeguards to protect the public, and committed a serious crime,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Daniel P. Bubar of the Western District of Virginia. “Our office will continue to closely partner with the FDA to ensure safety and effectiveness in our drug supply.”“‘Sports supplements’ that are manufactured and distributed outside the FDA’s oversight and that contain unapproved and possibly toxic ingredients endanger the health of unsuspecting consumers,” said Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations Catherine A. Hermsen, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations. “Today’s actions represent our continued commitment to pursuing and bringing to justice those who mislead the public and intentionally attempt to subvert the regulatory functions of the FDA through the distribution of unapproved and potentially dangerous products.”In pleading guilty, Parks also admitted that he intended to mislead and defraud the FDA and consumers by omitting ingredients on MedFitRX product labels, falsely claiming MedFitRX was licensed and registered to sell these new drugs, importing raw drug ingredients with the intent to avoid regulatory scrutiny, and misrepresenting MedFitRX products as “dietary supplements” or “sports supplements” to create the impression that they were safe and legal to use.Assistant U.S. Attorney Randy Ramseyer of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia and Trial Attorney Speare Hodges of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch prosecuted the case.

Attorney’s OfficeEastern District of VirginiaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASETuesday, February 9,2021ALEXANDRIA, Va. – A Florida man pleaded guilty today to unlawfully distributing thousands of prescription opioid pills in exchange for over half a million dollars through the “dark web.”According to court documents, between 2012 and 2020, Daren James Reid, 35, of Fort Lauderdale, used the dark web to distribute oxycodone. Under the monikers “Oxyflight” and “Imperial Royalty,” Reid sold over 12,000 oxycodone pills, the sales of which yielded a profit of over $500,000. Reid used dark web sites such as Silk Road, Wall Street, and Apollon to advertise and sell oxycodone pills of various strengths and prices. Reid utilized the U.S. Postal Service to illegally mail the pills to his customers across the U.S. in exchange for Bitcoin payments. Reid also possessed over one kilogram of oxycodone, morphine, and other pills in a storage facility in Florida.“Reid preyed upon the vulnerabilities of others by illegally distributing over half a million dollars of highly addictive opioids through dark web markets,” said Raj Parekh, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. “EDVA, along with its law enforcement partners, will continue to investigate and hold accountable individuals who pose a significant danger to our communities by placing profits over lives.”Reid pleaded guilty to unlawful distribution and possession with the intent to distribute oxycodone. He is scheduled to be sentenced on June 1 and faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each of the counts. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties.

Charged in the criminal complaint are:Olakitan Oluwalade (“Olaki”), age 22, of Windsor Mill, Maryland; Olaki’s cousin, Odunayo Baba Oluwalade (“Baba”), age 25, of Windsor Mill; and Kelly Lamont Williams, age 22, of Owings Mills, Maryland.The criminal complaint was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Robert K. Hur; Special Agent in Charge James R. Mancuso of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Baltimore; Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack of the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Field Office; Postal Inspector in Charge Peter R. Rendina of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service - Washington Division; and Chief Melissa R. Hyatt of the Baltimore County Police Department.U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur stated, “My office and the entire law enforcement community are committed to bringing to justice fraudsters who are preying on citizens during this unprecedented public health crisis. We will also continue our outreach efforts to make the public aware of scams and frauds. I urge citizens to remain vigilant and if you see something that doesn’t seem right, please report it.  Don’t become a victim.”“As the public seeks vaccines to protect themselves and their families from COVID-19, fraudsters are waiting to take advantage of their desperation. We want to remind the public to exercise extreme caution online, especially when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines, treatments, and protective equipment,” said Special Agent in Charge James R. Mancuso of HSI Baltimore. “HSI, with our local and federal partners, is working tirelessly around the country to get fraudulent websites off the internet and counterfeit personal protective equipment and medications off the streets to protect the public from these dangerous scams.”“It remains a top priority for the U.S. Postal Inspection Service to protect all Americans from individuals who take advantage of people during this public health emergency. We continue to work in conjunction with the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our partners in the COVID-19 Anti-Fraud Task Force to bring those who exploit people during this pandemic to justice,” said Inspector in Charge Peter R. Rendina of the Washington Division of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.“The FDA, along with its law enforcement partners across the country, continues its critical work of protecting American consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic by monitoring the U.S. marketplace for fraudulent COVID-19 products,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office. “We remain committed to bringing to justice those individuals and companies that seek to profit from this public health emergency.”According to the affidavit filed in support of the criminal complaint, on January 11, 2021, the HSI Intellectual Property Rights Center and the HSI Cyber Crimes Center became aware of a fraudulent replication of the website of Company 1, a biotechnology company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts that focuses on drug discovery, drug development, and vaccine technologies, including a vaccine for COVID-19. On December 18, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency-use authorization for Company 1’s COVID-19 vaccine to be distributed in the United States. Company 1’s public website,www.modernatx.com, provides information to the public on the products the company has developed, or is in the process of developing, including those focusing on combating the COVID-19 pandemic.As detailed in the complaint affidavit, the home page of the fraudulent replication of Company 1’s website, named “Modernatx.shop” (the “Fake Domain”) appeared visually similar to Company 1’s real website and displayed the name and trademarked logos for Company 1, and the logo, markings, colors and texts on the Fake Domain were visually similar to that of Company 1’s actual home page. The source code of the Fake Domain indicated that the creator of the site used a website tool to copy Company 1’s actual website in order to create the Fake Domain.However, the affidavit alleges that the Fake Domain (unlike Company 1’s home page) had the text: “YOU MAY BE ABLE TO BUY A COVID-19 VACCINE AHEAD OF TIME,” with a link to “Contact us.” On January 11, 2021, at approximately 3:58 p.m., an HSI Special Agent, in an undercover capacity (“UC”), contacted a number listed on the Fake Domain, which investigators determined was linked to an account on an encrypted messaging application which also allows voice-over-Internet calls and video chats. The number replied approximately two hours later requesting an e-mail address to contact the UC, which the UC provided. The affidavit alleges that approximately four minutes later the UC received an e-mail fromsales@modernatx.shop, an e-mail address which appears on the Fake Domain, purporting to welcome the UC to Company 1 and providing a brief description of Company 1 and the storage requirements of Company 1’s vaccine.According to the affidavit, after several additional e-mails, the UC received information regarding payment, delivery, and purchase for alleged Company 1 vaccines from a Google e-mail address. The UC was sent a purported invoice for 200 doses of Company 1’s vaccine at $30.00 per dose, for a total of $6,000, with payment terms listed as 50% up front and 50% upon delivery. The UC was allegedly instructed to send payment to a Navy Federal Credit Union account in the name of Kelly Lamont Williams. The UC transferred a portion of the funds to Williams’s account as directed.On January 15, 2021, the government seized the Fake Domain and HSI agents executed a search warrant at Williams’s home. Law enforcement subsequently executed search warrants at Olaki’s and Baba’s homes. As a result of these searches, investigators recovered a number of communications between Baba, Olaki, and Williams discussing the fraud scheme. After the search at Williams’s residence, but before the searches at Olaki’s and Baba’s homes, investigators used Williams’s phone to send Baba a message: “Yo where u want me send the bread?” (referring to the cash investigators had sent to Williams’s bank account for the purchase of alleged vaccines as directed). Baba allegedly replied, “Yea send me some thru zelle and some through cash app.” Both Zelle & Cash App are online payment platforms. The affidavit alleges that Baba provided his Cash App User ID name, and investigators made a cash transfer of the funds to Baba’s Cash App account per his request.As detailed in the affidavit, Olaki allegedly referred Williams to Baba as someone who could assist with the fraud. Williams allegedly agreed to allow the conspirators to use his bank account to deposit the fraud payments in exchange for a cut of the fraud proceeds. Olaki allegedly was also supposed to receive a part of the fraud proceeds. Several of the recovered communications also indicated that Olaki allegedly applied for, and received a fraudulent COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan funded by the federal government in the summer of 2020.If convicted, the defendants each face a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. The defendants will have an initial appearance on February 12, 2021, in U.S. District Court in Baltimore.A criminal complaint is not a finding of guilt. An individual charged by criminal complaint is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty at some later criminal proceedings.Federal law enforcement agencies are united in our efforts to fight against COVID-19 fraud. HSI has identified tips to recognize and report COVID-19 fraud. If you believe you are a victim of a fraud or attempted fraud involving COVID-19, you may also call the National Center for Disaster Fraud Hotline at 1-866-720-5721 or go to justice.gov/coronavirus.United States Attorney Robert K. Hur commended HSI, the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the Baltimore County Police Department for their work in the investigation.  Mr. Hur thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Aaron S. J. Zelinsky and Sean Delaney, who are prosecuting the case.# # #Topic(s):CoronavirusComponent(s):USAO - MarylandContact:Marcia Murphy (410) 209-4854"

As part of a criminal resolution, FKOL agreed to plead guilty to the misdemeanor offense, pay a criminal fine of $30 million, and forfeit an additional $20 million. FKOL also agreed to implement a compliance and ethics program designed to prevent, detect, and correct violations of U.S. law relating to FKOL’s manufacture of cancer drugs intended for terminally ill patients.“By hiding and deleting manufacturing records, FKOL sought to obstruct the FDA’s regulatory authority and prevent the FDA from doing its job of ensuring the purity and potency of drugs intended for U.S. consumers,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “FKOL’s conduct put vulnerable patients at risk. The Department of Justice will continue to work with FDA to prosecute drug manufacturers who obstruct these inspections.”“Pharmaceutical companies that obstruct FDA inspections jeopardize patient safety,” said U.S. Attorney Nicholas A. Trutanich for the District of Nevada. “Maintaining the integrity of records and data is a critical part of drug manufacturing, and our office will continue prosecuting those that obstruct FDA inspections by destroying records or other means.”“FDA inspections of pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities help ensure the strength, quality and purity of our medicines. Any attempt to obstruct or interfere with these inspections threatens the public health,” said Judy McMeekin, Pharm.D., Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs of the FDA. “We will continue to aggressively investigate and present any such obstruction for prosecution.”According to court documents, FKOL owned and operated a manufacturing plant in Kalyani, West Bengal, India, that manufactured active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) used in various cancer drug products distributed to the United States. The government alleges that prior to a January 2013 FDA inspection of the Kalyani facility, FKOL plant management directed employees to remove certain records from the premises and delete other records from computers that would have revealed FKOL was manufacturing drug ingredients in contravention of FDA requirements. Kalyani plant employees removed computers, hardcopy documents, and other materials from the premises and deleted spreadsheets that contained evidence of the plant’s violative practices.This case is being prosecuted by Assistant Director Clint Narver and Trial Attorney Natalie Sanders of the Department of Justice’s Consumer Protection Branch, with assistance from Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas D. Dickinson of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Nevada. The FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, Los Angeles Field Office, investigated the case.

Selna.Lee pleaded guilty in September to one count of smuggling misbranded drugs, in this case Sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra. Lee specifically admitted that in late 2016, he caused 21.4 kilograms of the drug to be imported into the United States from China. In his plea agreement, Lee admitted smuggling both Sildenafil and Tadalafil, the active ingredient in Cialis, that were illegally brought into the U.S. under descriptions such as “Acrylic Paint” and “Glass Bottles.”Lee used the Sildenafil and Tadalafil to manufacture pills he sold to distributors, who then sold the products to liquor, gas and convenience stores across the United States, according to court documents. Even though his products contained drugs that required a prescription, the labels on Lee’s products either stated that no prescription was necessary or failed to state one was needed – meaning the products were mislabeled.Over the course of about 2½ years – until his businesses were shut down by federal authorities in October 2018 – Lee sold at least $3.5 million worth of pills under numerous names, including “Rhino” and variations of that name.Lee “organized the importation of bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients into the United States from China under false pretenses,” prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memorandum. “He then used this bulk powder to sell counterfeit prescription drugs across the United States totaling millions in sales. At least one of the consumers of [Lee’s] drugs, Victim S.S., suffered a serious medical condition after taking [Lee’s] counterfeit pills.”Lee has been in federal custody since his arrest in this case on October 31, 2018.Lee has agreed to forfeit his $1.2 million residence in Fullerton, nearly $458,000 seized from eight bank accounts, $346,324 in U.S. currency, and a 2018 Cadillac Escalade.The investigation in this case was conducted by the United States Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, Homeland Security Investigations, the Los Angeles Police Department, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the FBI.This case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Jake Nare of the Santa Ana Branch Office.

Hermsen. “We remain committed to pursuing and bringing to justice those who mislead the public and attempt to subvert the regulatory functions of the FDA by distributing unapproved and potentially dangerous products.”In pleading guilty, Parks also admitted that he intended to mislead and defraud the FDA and consumers by omitting ingredients on MedFitRX product labels, falsely claiming MedFitRX was licensed and registered to sell these new drugs, importing raw drug ingredients with the intent to avoid regulatory scrutiny, and misrepresenting MedFitRX products as “dietary supplements” or “sports supplements” to create the impression that they were safe and legal to use.A sentencing hearing has been scheduled for February 16, 2020 at 2:30pm.Assistant United States Attorney Randy Ramseyer of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia and Trial Attorney Speare Hodges of the Department of Justice Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch are prosecuting the case.

Hyslop, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington, announced that Sami Anwar, 42, of Richland, WA, was found guilty late Friday of Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud, Conspiracy to Commit Mail Fraud, and 45 additional charged crimes including Wire Fraud, Mail Fraud, Obtaining Controlled Substances Through Fraud, and Furnishing False Information to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).According to the Superseding Indictment on which Sami Anwar was found guilty of all counts, and the evidence presented during the three-week long trial, between 2013 and 2018 Sami Anwar headed a conspiracy to have his companies fraudulently pose as legitimate human clinical research trial sites and provided mountains of false clinical research trial data regarding drug safety and drug efficacy to dozens of drug companies and, through them, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The false clinical research data that Sami Anwar injected into the public health system included safety data on dozens of different drugs and medicines designed to treat a wide variety of diseases and conditions including, but not limited to, heart disease, diabetes, asthma, pediatric illnesses, adolescent smoking, cirrhosis, scabies, depression, and opioid addiction to name just a few, according the evidence presented at trial. The evidence at trial indicated that Sami Anwar and his companies received over $5.6 million dollars from the fraud.According to court documents and the evidence presented at trial, Sami Anwar, who is not a licensed medical doctor, would pose as a doctor and forge the signatures of the doctors he employed. In addition, over a dozen former employees of Sami Anwar testified that he directly instructed them to assist him in committing the fraud including falsifying medical records and data to admit dozens of ineligible research subjects; falsifying research data including electrocardiograms and vital signs, obtaining blood specimens from Sami Anwar’s employees or stealing them from unwitting medical patients of his medical center, disposing of study medications by shooting them down the drain and then falsely recording them as having been properly injected as required, dangerously hoarding opioids intended to be dispensed to study subjects, and fabricating required subject diary entries.According to the evidence presented at trial and the Superseding Indictment, Sami Anwar not only directed the fraud but engaged in threats, retaliation, and intimidation in order to hide his crimes from drug companies, the FDA, which regulates human clinical trials in the United States, and law enforcement. At trial numerous former employees of Sami Anwar testified that Anwar filed false police reports, made false allegations to the Washington State Department of Health, the FDA, threatened them at their homes, at their places of work, slashed their tires, and stalked them in order to prevent them from cooperating with the authorities.United States Attorney Hyslop stated, “Every day, Americans rely on the data from clinical research trials to keep us safe from deadly diseases and dangerous side effects. Injecting fraudulent and corrupt data into the system is an egregious breach of the trust and faith we all place in those who perform these vitally important trials.” Hyslop continued, “Based on the evidence presented at trial, and the jury’s unanimous verdict, Mr. Anwar profited from his blatant disregard for patient safety by running his fraudulent enterprise through fear and intimidation. “We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to ensure that those who continue to abuse this trust and undermine our health care system are brought to justice.”Two of Sami Anwar’s companies, Zain Research LLC and Mid Columbia Research LLC, were also convicted of participating in the conspiracy.After the jury delivered their unanimous verdict Senior Judge Edward F. Shea set sentencing for March 11, 2020 at 10:00 a.m. in Richland, WA. Sami Anwar will remain in custody pending sentencing. The maximum term of incarceration for each count of fraud is 20 years in federal prison.This case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Dan Fruchter and Tyler Tornabene. The case was investigated by DEA Diversion Investigators Craig Tom and Kevin Tripp. Subject matter expertise was provided by the Food and Drug Administration.Topic(s):OpioidsPrescription DrugsHealth Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - Washington, Eastern"

Murray announced today.According to court documents and statements made in court, in November 2006, a federal grand jury charged BenMoshe with conspiracy to launder monetary instruments and conspiracy to engage in unlicensed wholesale distribution of prescription drugs. After an initial appearance hearing on January 29, 2007, BenMoshe was released on conditions including his promise to notify the pretrial services officer of any plans to change his residence and to travel outside of the Central District of California and the District of New Hampshire. On January 9, 2009, BenMoshe pled guilty to conspiracy to engage in unlicensed wholesale distribution of prescription drugs. The Court accepted his guilty plea and permitted him to continue on the same conditions of release pending sentencing.  The sentencing hearing was scheduled for June 23, 2009. On or about April 29, 2009, in violation of his conditions of release, BenMoshe moved to Israel and failed to appear for his sentencing hearing on June 23, 2009.On December 16, 2009, a federal grand jury charged BenMoshe with bail jumping for his failure to appear at his sentencing hearing.In August of 2020, BenMoshe was extradited from Israel to the United States to face the charges pending against him in New Hampshire.BenMoshe is scheduled to be sentenced in both cases on April 1, 2021.“This prosecution demonstrates that defendants cannot flee from the United States to escape responsibility for their crimes,” said U.S. Attorney Murray.  “BenMoshe violated his promise to appear in court for sentencing and spent years avoiding the ultimate judicial reckoning for his crime.  Through hard work and diligence, the U.S. Marshals located this fugitive and he was extradited back to New Hampshire to face the consequences of his 2009 guilty plea and his flight from justice.  Other criminal defendants should take note that efforts to flee from justice will not succeed.”“The arrest and subsequent extradition of BenMoshe is a testament to the collaborative work of the US Marshals Service and the US Attorney’s Office for the District of New Hampshire,” said Nick Willard, U.S. Marshal for the District of New Hampshire.  “We are also grateful for the cooperation of the Israeli authorities who worked closely with the Deputy Marshals for a safe and professional transfer into our custody.”This matter was investigated by the United States Marshals Service.  The underlying criminal case was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Internal Revenue Service.  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Cam Le and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Sarah Hawkins.###Component(s):USAO - New HampshirePress Release Number:21-017"

Acting United States Attorney Daniel P. Bubar made the announcement today.Lewis, 35, of Roanoke, Virginia, was sentenced today to 12 months and 1 day in federal prison. He pleaded guilty in September 2020 to one count of tampering with a consumer product.  The United States requested a sentence of 51 months.“Tampering with powerful narcotics can harm patients and will not be tolerated,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Bubar.  “We appreciate the good work on this case by FDA, DEA, DHP, and VSP that brought Lewis to justice and demonstrates our commitment to ensure the public receives safe and unadulterated medication.”“Those who knowingly tamper with and steal medicines risk harming patients by depriving them of their prescribed therapies,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office. “We will continue to protect the public health and bring to justice healthcare professionals and others who take advantage of their position and compromise patients’ health and comfort by tampering with needed drugs.”According to court documents, in January 2018 an employee at Home Choice Partners in Roanoke discovered a needle, alcohol pad, and a bloody tissue in the toilet of an employee bathroom and reported it to another employee. When asked by that employee if he knew anything about the items, Lewis said the items may have fallen out of his pocket. The employee contacted human resources and a decision was made to drug test all employees.Lewis, who was scheduled to be off work on the day of the drug test, was instructed to report to work to be administered a drug screening. However, Lewis contacted an employee and explained that he was the employee responsible for the items in the toilet. When asked, Lewis explained he had been engaging in such conduct for nine months. Lewis admitted there was a 50 ml vial of hydromorphone in the back of the narcotics cabinet that did not contain hydromorphone, but instead had been replaced, by him, with saline.The investigation of the case was conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration – Office of Criminal Investigations, Drug Enforcement Administration Diversion Control Division, Virginia Department of Health Professions, and Virginia State Police.

U.S. District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs scheduled sentencing for May 20, 2021.While working at a Massachusetts hospital in January 2016, Croft administered hydromorphone and meperidine – both Schedule II controlled substances – to emergency department patients in need of pain relief. Between Jan. 5 and Jan. 14, 2016, Croft tampered with carpujects – syringe devices used to administer injectable fluid medication – containing hydromorphone and meperidine by accessing the automated dispensing machine (ADM) in the hospital’s emergency department.Specifically, Croft used his credentials to access the ADM and removed carpujects containing hydromorphone and meperidine. He then used syringes to puncture the carpujects and removed portions of the hdyromprohone and meperidine for his own use. In some instances, Croft replaced the medication he removed with saline in an attempt to conceal his conduct. To avoid detection, Croft later put the carpujects with the diluted medication back in the ADM where they remained available for nurses to unwittingly use on patients. Croft also used his credentials to enter a “return to stock” transactions in the ADM, making it falsely appear that no medications had been removed from the carpuject.The charge of tampering with a consumer product provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. The charge of obtaining a controlled substance by misrepresentation, fraud, deception and subterfuge provides for a sentence of up to four years in prison, one year of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.United States Attorney Andrew E.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeEastern District of WisconsinFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASETuesday, January 26,2021United States Attorney Matthew D. Krueger of the Eastern District of Wisconsin announced that on January 26, 2021, Steven R. Brandenburg (age: 46) of Grafton, Wisconsin, signed a plea agreement acknowledging that he was guilty of attempting to render hundreds of doses of COVID-19 vaccine ineffective, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1365.Brandenburg is charged by an Information with two counts of attempting to tamper with consumer products, with reckless disregard for the risk that another person will be placed in danger of death or bodily injury. Brandenburg has agreed to plead guilty to the charges, which each carry a maximum sentence of ten years’ imprisonment.As detailed in court documents, while working as a hospital pharmacist in Grafton, Wisconsin, on two successive overnight shifts in late December, Brandenburg purposefully removed a box of COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by Moderna—which must be stored at specific cold temperatures to remain viable—from the hospital’s refrigeration unit, intending to render the vaccine inert and no longer effective. According to the plea agreement, Brandenburg believed in various “conspiracy theories”; subscribed to notions of “alternative history”; and was skeptical of vaccines in general and the Moderna vaccine specifically. Brandenburg had communicated his beliefs about vaccines to his co-workers for at least the past two years.After leaving the vaccines out for several hours each night, Brandenburg returned the vaccines to the refrigerator to be used in the hospital’s vaccine clinic the following day. Before the full extent of Brandenburg’s conduct was discovered, 57 people received doses of the vaccine from these vials.“Distributing the COVID-19 vaccine is critical to overcoming this pandemic, which continues to end lives and upend our economy,” said United States Attorney Krueger.  “As these charges show, the Justice Department will pursue anyone—and especially any medical professional—who tampers with the vaccine.”“Tampering with vaccine doses in the midst of a global health crisis calls for a strong response, as reflected by the serious charges the United States has brought today,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. “The Department of Justice will continue to work with its law enforcement partners to ensure the public receives safe and effective vaccines.”“The FDA has ensured that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine meets the agency’s rigorous standards for quality, safety, and efficacy. Those who knowingly tamper with this vaccine place American patients’ health at risk,” said FDA Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations Catherine A. Hermsen. “Today’s announcement should serve as a reminder that this kind of illicit tampering activity will not be tolerated.”“Pharmacists rank among some of the most trusted professionals,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert Hughes. “This individual used his special access to tamper with vials of the much needed COVID-19 vaccine. The FBI takes allegations of consumer product tampering very seriously and will use all available resources to bring those to justice who intentionally put the public’s health at risk.”“The actions by Mr. Brandenburg are not representative of the great people at Aurora Grafton who, day in and day out, serve our community. I am extremely proud of those who came forward to expose Mr. Brandenburg’s actions. I am also proud of my team’s efforts, their professionalism, hard work and diligence on this case. Finally, I would like to thank all of our federal partners and the Ozaukee County DA’s Office for working with us on this case—it is through these partnerships that we are able to accomplish great things,”  said Jeff A. Caponera, Grafton Chief of PoliceAdam Gerol, Ozaukee County District Attorney said, “I’m grateful for the hard work and dedication of all the law enforcement officers, and the prosecutors from the federal government, that was necessary to bring an appropriate level of prosecution and punishment to this case.  Unfortunately, the facts of this incident simply didn’t fit a charge provided for by Wisconsin law that carried a sufficient measure of punishment. Hopefully, what transpired here will emphasize the need to expand the scope of our existing statutes should anything like this happen again.”This matter was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, the Milwaukee Field Office of the FBI, and the Village of Grafton Police Department. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin C. Knight of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, and Senior Litigation Counsel Ross S. Goldstein and Trial Attorney Rachel Baron of the Department of Justice Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch.The claims made in the Information are allegations that, if the case were to proceed to trial, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt to convict the defendant.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeWestern District of WashingtonFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, January 21,2021Defendant Persisted Despite Cease and Desist Letter and Consent Decree from Washington State Attorney GeneralSeattle - A Redmond, Washington, man who held himself out as a biotech expert was arrested today on a federal warrant charging him with introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce, announced U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran. JOHNNY T. STINE, 55, claims to be Founder & President of North Coast Biologics. In a variety of online postings from as early as March 2, 2020, STINE claimed to have a COVID-19 vaccine that he offered to inject in customers for $400-$1000 each. STINE will appear in U.S. District Court in Seattle at 2:00 today.“Untested, untried and potentially unsafe – this defendant was injecting people with an unknown substance claiming it was a vaccine for COVID-19,” said U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran. “Preying on our fears in the midst of this pandemic is unconscionable.  DOJ continues to investigate and prosecute these fraud cases.”According to the criminal complaint unsealed today, in early March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration - Office of Criminal Investigation (FDA-OCI), was alerted to Stine’s posts on social media. An investigator made contact with Stine in an undercover capacity, and STINE represented that he had a COVID-19 vaccine for sale.  STINE claimed that his main biotech effort was creating vaccines that attack cancer tumors. He indicated that he had used a similar method to develop his COVID-19 vaccine.  On March 27, 2020, even as the undercover investigation was ongoing, FDA-OCI received a complaint from an area resident about STINE injecting a friend of the complainant with a “vaccine” for COVID-19. Just this month, January 2021, law enforcement was alerted that at least one person who had been “vaccinated” by STINE was in the hospital battling COVID-19.In early April, investigators met with Stine in undercover roles. STINE represented to the agents that he traveled across the U.S. giving his vaccine. STINE indicated he would make a trip to Oregon and California to vaccinate family members of the undercover agents.In late April, responding to complaints from the public, the Washington State Attorney General issued a cease and desist letter to STINE, telling him to stop making claims and offering his “vaccine” for COVID-19. Rather than be deterred, STINE indicated it had just increased demand for his injections which he now called “immunogen” instead of a vaccine. In June, STINE signed a Consent Decree with the Washington State Attorney General wherein he agreed not to promote or sell his COVID-19 vaccine.Still, in August STINE again communicated with an undercover agent and traveled to Idaho to “vaccinate” the agent. Law enforcement contacted STINE in Idaho and seized the “vaccine.” Agents also executed a court-authorized search warrant on the Redmond warehouse where STINE claimed to conduct his research.The investigation also revealed that STINE conducted a business preying on cancer patients selling them untested “vaccines” to battle their malignant tumors. That conduct, along with the COVID-19, vaccine is charged in a separate Information filed today in federal court.“Unproven injectable vaccines purported to prevent or treat COVID-19, made from unknown substances under unknown conditions, present significant health risks in and of themselves. They also can lead consumers to make lifestyle choices that increase their actual risk of infection with COVID-19, or to delay or stop appropriate medical treatment,” said Lisa L. Malinowski, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office. “The FDA will continue to investigate fraudulent COVID-19 treatments and bring to justice those who try to profit from the pandemic by offering unproven and illegally marketed coronavirus products.”“The very idea that someone would prey upon fearful people seeking a COVID vaccine in the midst of a global pandemic is not only despicable, but potentially deadly behavior. Equally appalling is the exploitation of vulnerable cancer patients and their families, desperate for treatment,” said Special Agent in Charge Robert Hammer, who oversees Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) operations in the Pacific Northwest. “Snake oil salesmen, such as this, who endanger consumers should take this arrest as a stern warning.  HSI, along with our law enforcement partners, remain dedicated to protecting the community from these criminals and the dangerous substances they sell.”The criminal charges filed today are misdemeanor federal crimes, unrelated to the civil cease and desist letter and civil Consent Decree. The misdemeanors are punishable by up to one year in prison.The charges contained in the complaint and Information are only allegations. A person is presumed innocent unless and until he or she is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.The case is being investigated by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Homeland Security Investigations, and the Seattle Police Department.The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Brian Werner who serves as the COVID-19 fraud coordinator for the U.S. Attorney’s Office.Topic(s):CoronavirusHealth Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - Washington, WesternContact:Press contact for the U.S. Attorney’s Office is Communications Director Emily Langlie at (206) 553-4110 orEmily.Langlie@usdoj.gov."

During his employment, he stole medical devices and/or medical supplies from the hospital and resold them via the internet to customers throughout the United States. Defendant Paul Purdy never informed the purchasers that the medical devices and/or supplies he sold to them were stolen. Purdy resigned from the hospital in 2017 and enlisted Valdet Seferovic, an employee of the hospital, to continue the scheme of stealing medical device and/or medical supplies. Valdet Serferovic had access to the medical supply and the cleaning and disinfecting rooms at the hospital. Purdy and Seferovic primarily stole three types of medical devices: (1) cystoscopes, a thin tube with a camera which is inserted through the urethra and into the bladder, some of which may have been contaminated as they were stolen from the cleaning and disinfecting room after being used in surgical procedures; (2) Ophthalmoscopes, an instrument for inspecting the retina and the other parts of the eye; and (3) Otoscopes, an instrument for inspecting the ears. Purdy and Seferovic sold these devices and/or supplies via the internet to customers throughout the United States.  The purchasers were never informed that the medical devices and/or supplies were stolen.According to the indictment, in September 2017, Valdet Seferovic also agreed to steal and sell medical devices and/or medical supplies to Zafar Khan, the owner of Wholesale Medical & Surgical Suppliers of America, LLC.  Once Khan acquired the stolen medical devices and/or medical supplies he sold them to unsuspecting purchasers via the internet.United States Attorney Schneider stated, “These defendants used their employment status to circumvent the safety protocols established by Beaumont Hospital to profit from the theft of medical devices and put the health and safety of the general public at risk in doing so. This indictment should send a clear message that our office is committed to prosecuting anyone who would endanger the health and safety of the general public for personal gain.”“Medical devices that are removed from their rightful place in a hospital or other medical setting put patients’ health at risk by denying them access to needed diagnostic imaging and treatment,” said Special Agent in Charge Lynda M. Burdelik, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Chicago Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who jeopardize the public’s health for profit. And we commend our law enforcement colleagues for their assistance in this case.”This case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Regina R. McCullough. The case was investigated by special agents of the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations and the Royal Oak Police Department.An indictment is only a charge and is not evidence of guilt.  The defendants are entitled to a fair trial in which it will be the government’s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Component(s):USAO - Michigan, Eastern"

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, January 8,2021A Florida medical doctor pleaded guilty to conspiring to falsify clinical trial data regarding an asthma medication, the Department of Justice announced today.Dr. Yvelice Villaman Bencosme, 64, of Miami, Florida, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Bencosme was a licensed medical doctor who served as the primary investigator for clinical trials purportedly conducted at a medical clinic called Unlimited Medical Research (UM Research) in Miami. In pleading guilty, Bencosme admitted that from approximately 2013 to 2016, she participated in a scheme to defraud an unnamed pharmaceutical company by fabricating the data and participation of subjects in a clinical trial at UM Research. The clinical trial was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of an asthma medication in children between the ages of four and 11. Bencosme admitted that she falsified medical records to make it appear that pediatric subjects arrived for scheduled visits at UM Research, took study drugs as required, and received checks as payment for site visits.“Clinical trials are critical to ensuring the safety and effectivness of new drugs. Falsifying that data can endanger consumers,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Bossert Clark of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department of Justice will continue to work hand-in-hand with the FDA to investigate and prosecute fraudsters who put personal profit before public health.”“When those charged with investigating the efficacy of new drugs manipulate the data for personal profit, they violate the public’s trust and pose serious threats to our collective health and safety,” said U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan for the Southern District of Florida. “Such selfish and irresponsible behavior is criminal and will be prosecuted.”“FDA’s evaluation of a new drug begins with an analysis of reliable and accurate data from clinical trials. Compromised clinical trial data could impact the agency’s decisions about the safety and effectiveness of the drug under review,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin C. Fielder of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations, Miami Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who deny the public their right to safe and effective medicines.”Bencosme pleaded guilty before U.S. District Court Judge Beth Bloom. When sentenced, Bencosme faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Bencosme is the second defendant to plead guilty in this matter. Lisett Raventos, a former study coordinator at UM Research, pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge in November 2020. Two other defendants were charged in connection with the scheme, and they are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.Trial Attorneys Joshua Rothman and Kara M. Traster of the Department of Justice Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch are prosecuting the case.

Some of those drugs were shipped into the Western District of Virginia, Acting United States Attorney Daniel P. Bubar announced today.Becker 32, currently of Concord, Michigan, and Accelerated Genetix, LLC, a sport supplement company based in Argyle, Texas, pleaded guilty to one count of distributing unapproved new drugs with the intent to mislead and defraud the FDA and consumers.Becker admitted that, from approximately January 2016 to March 2019, he and his company unlawfully distributed Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (“SARMs”) and other substances that the FDA has not approved, including Ostarine and Ligandrol. SARMs are synthetic chemicals designed to mimic the effects of testosterone and other anabolic steroids. The FDA has long warned against the use of SARMs like those found in Accelerated Genetix products, including stating in a 2017 warning letter to another firm that SARMs have been linked to life-threatening reactions including liver toxicity, and have the potential to increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.“Drugs masquerading as dietary supplements sidestep the FDA approval process and put consumers at risk,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Bossert Clark of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.  “The Department of Justice will continue to work with FDA to ensure a safe and effective drug supply.”In connection with his plea, Becker agreed to forfeit approximately $3.5 million, reflecting the amount of Accelerated Genetix products sold across the United States through retail outlets and over the internet.“Becker and his company put their customers’ health at risk by unlawfully distributing drugs without FDA approval,” said Acting United States Attorney Bubar. “This case is particularly troubling, given the FDA’s explicit and repeated warnings about the dangers of SARMs.  FDA regulations are integral to safeguarding consumers, and I am proud of our federal team that took on this investigation to ensure the processes and the public are protected.”“The FDA’s laws are designed to protect the public health by ensuring, among other things, that drugs are safe and effective for their intended uses,” said FDA Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations Catherine A. Hermsen. “Those who manufacture drugs disguised as supplements outside the FDA’s oversight endanger consumers.  We remain committed to bringing to justice companies and individuals who attempt to subvert the regulatory functions of the FDA by distributing unapproved, and potentially dangerous, drugs.”In pleading guilty, Becker also admitted that he intended to mislead and defraud the FDA and consumers by importing these ingredients even after learning they were mislabeled by the distributor when they were shipped from China to the United States; misrepresenting Accelerated Genetix products as “dietary supplements” to create the impression that they were safe and legal to use; and manufacturing a custom order of a SARMs product despite knowing it was illegal to introduce the unapproved new drug into interstate commerce.U.S. District Judge Jones heard the defendants’ guilty pleas in federal court in Abingdon, Virginia, and set sentencing for March 15, 2021.Assistant United States Attorney Randy Ramseyer of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia and Trial Attorney Speare Hodges of the Department of Justice Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch are prosecuting the case.

The drug is sometimes improperly, and dangerously, used as a weight loss drug, but when ingested is highly toxic to humans. Oral exposure to DNP may cause serious adverse events, including dehydration, cataracts, liver damage, and death. In 1938, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared DNP to be extremely dangerous and not fit for human consumption. At that time, the FDA announced publicly that it would prosecute those who manufacture and distribute DNP for use as a drug.According to the indictment, between October 2018 and May 2020, Holloway sold DNP to consumers throughout the United States and in a number of foreign countries and misbranded the substance as a yellow pigment powder.  Holloway purchased bulk DNP and utilized eBay and other websites to market and sell the drug over the internet. Holloway did not label the package as DNP, nor did she include any directions or warnings regarding the use of the drug when she mailed it to consumers.United States Attorney Schneider stated, “This indictment should send a clear message to those who would profit from the sale of unapproved drugs that we will utilize every tool at our disposal to vigorously prosecute you in order to protect the health and safety of the general public.

        "content": "Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, December 17,2020Action Follows Sentencing of Former CEO and Corporate ResolutionsTimothy Baxter, the former medical director of Indivior PLC, was sentenced today in federal court in Abingdon, Virginia, to six months of home detention and 100 hours of community service in connection with the company’s marketing of an opioid drug.Baxter pleaded guilty in August 2020 to a one-count misdemeanor Information related to Indivior’s false and misleading representations to the Massachusetts Medicaid program (MassHealth) regarding Suboxone, a drug approved for recovering opioid addicts to avoid or reduce withdrawal symptoms. In connection with his guilty plea to causing the introduction into interstate commerce of misbranded drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Baxter admitted that he failed to prevent Indivior from sending false and misleading information to MassHealth related to the relative safety of Suboxone Film, a version of Suboxone, around children.“In this administration, the Department of Justice has augmented its important and ongoing drug enforcement efforts with a series of new initiatives targeted at illegal conduct involving prescription opioid drugs,” said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen.  “The Department’s multi-pronged prosecution of Indivior’s unlawful promotion of Suboxone is a prime example of how to combat this crisis through diverse strategies.  The net effect of the Department’s Indivior-related cases will bolster ongoing efforts to punish criminal conduct in the opioid space, deter further criminal conduct among opioid manufacturers and their top executives, and contribute significantly to the Department’s objective to stem the tide of this epidemic.”“When Timothy Baxter failed to ensure Indivior provided honest and accurate information to a state Medicaid program about Suboxone, it resulted in overstated safety claims and criminal conduct,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Daniel P. Bubar.  “Baxter’s failure was especially egregious, given his role in the company as global medical director.  Today’s sentence ought to be a deterrent to other pharmaceutical executives against providing anything less than truthful information about their products.  We could not have done this case without the hard work of and cooperation with the Virginia Attorney General’s Office and our federal partners, for which we are incredibly grateful.”“The Opioid crisis continues to be a critical public health issue with the toll of addiction—in lost lives and broken families—affecting every community in America. Addressing this crisis is one of the FDA’s highest priorities,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “Medication-assisted treatments incorporating drugs like Indivior’s Suboxone, in combination with counseling and behavioral therapy, are an important tool in combating opioid use disorder but can quickly become part of the problem if not used responsibly. When companies and their leadership provide misleading information about relative product benefits, they can ultimately risk more misuse, abuse, diversion, and accidental exposure to opioid drugs as well as make treatment more difficult to obtain for those suffering from this crisis. We will continue to work with the Department of Justice to investigate and hold accountable those who devise and participate in schemes to the detriment of the public health.”According to court documents, Baxter helped oversee Indivior’s efforts in 2012 to secure formulary coverage for Suboxone Film from MassHealth. Indivior employees devised a strategy to win preferred drug status for Suboxone Film and counteract a non-opioid competitor MassHealth was considering for opioid-addiction treatment. A certain Indivior employee subsequently shared false and misleading safety information with MassHealth officials about Suboxone Film’s risk of accidental pediatric exposure. Baxter failed to prevent this course of conduct carried out by an employee under his supervision. Two months after receiving that false and misleading information, MassHealth announced it would provide access to Suboxone Film for Medicaid patients with children under the age of six.Indivior’s former CEO, Shaun Thaxter, was sentenced in October 2020 to six months in prison and a $600,000 criminal fine and forfeiture after he pleaded guilty to the same charge. U.S. District Court Judge James P. Jones of the Western District of Virginia handed down the sentences for both Baxter and Thaxter. The cases follow corporate criminal and civil resolutions announced by the Department earlier this year. In total, payments made by Indivior Solutions and its parent companies, Indivior Inc. and Indivior plc, along with payments made under a 2019 resolution with Indivior’s former parent, Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, will exceed $2 billion. That amount represents the second-largest monetary resolution obtained by the Department of Justice in a case involving an opioid drug.The criminal case against Indivior was prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia; the Department of Justice Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch; the Department of Justice Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch; the Virginia Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the Office of the Virginia Attorney General; and the Federal Trade Commission.  This matter was investigated by the Virginia Attorney General’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit; FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigation; the United States Postal Service Office of Inspector General; and the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General.The joint effort advances the goals of the Department’s Prescription Interdiction & Litigation (PIL) Task Force to deploy all available criminal, civil, and regulatory tools to hold opioid manufacturers accountable for unlawful practices and to ensure that prescription opioid products are marketed truthfully.For more information about the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia, visit its website at https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdva.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of New JerseyFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASETuesday, December 15,2020CAMDEN, N.J. – A Cumberland County, New Jersey, man admitted today conspiring to illegally distribute over 1 million prescription pills and launder drug trafficking proceeds through the use of fictitious shell companies, U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito announced.Alton Chatmon, 50, of Bridgeton, New Jersey, pleaded guilty by videoconference before U.S. District Judge Joseph H. Rodriguez to an information charging him with one count of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, including Tramadol, a synthetic opioid, and butabital; and one count of conspiring to commit money laundering.According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:Chatmon is a former licensed pharmacist who operated two pharmacies in southern New Jersey until 2015. In 2015, after a DEA inspection of his pharmacies showed violations of regulations for the handling of controlled substances, Chatmon voluntarily surrendered his DEA registration, which had allowed him to process and fill prescriptions for controlled substances. In 2016, the State of New Jersey suspended Chatmon’s pharmacist license for two years.From January 2017 until August 2018, Chatmon obtained large quantities of Tramadol pills from suppliers outside the United States by having the pills shipped to numerous U.S. Post Office boxes that he directed a conspirator to open in the names of fictitious businesses. Chatmon received customer orders from other conspirators that had been placed on internet sites or over the phone. He and his conspirators repackaged the Tramadol, a Schedule IV controlled substance, and butabital, a Schedule III controlled substance, and mailed the pills to customers to fill their orders. Chatmon admitted filling the orders for the customers of the unlicensed online pharmacy, knowing that the customers did not have valid prescriptions, that he was not a licensed pharmacist at the time, and without regard for whether the customers had any legitimate medical need for these medications. In exchange for the pills provided, the customers provided Chatmon and other conspirators with U.S. Postal money orders, which were deposited into bank accounts that Chatmon and his conspirators controlled. The bank accounts were set up using shell companies designed to disguise the source and control of the funds. Chatmon and his conspirators also sent interstate and international wire transfers totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars to their drug suppliers in both India and in other states around the United States to pay for the pills supplied to them.Chatmon admitted that the drug conspiracy involved the illegal distribution of over 600,000 Tramadol pills and over 1 million Fioricet pills (containing butabital). He also admitted that the money laundering conspiracy involved the laundering of over $1.5 million in drug trafficking proceeds.Chatmon faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $750,000.

Birge announced today that Denise D’Andrea pleaded guilty to one count of causing the adulteration of a medical device.  In the criminal information, the government alleged that Ms. D’Andrea, the Director of Clinical Services at The Prometheus Group (“Prometheus”), a device manufacturer headquartered in Dover, New Hampshire, trained medical practitioners in the Western District of Michigan to reuse a single-user rectal pressure sensor on multiple patients by covering it with a surgical glove between uses.  The rectal pressure sensor is a component part of Prometheus’s Pathway CTS 2000 Pelvic Floor Training System used in a form of therapy known as pelvic muscle rehabilitation.  FDA cleared this system for introduction into the market in 2000, but restricted use of the rectal pressure sensor to single-patient use only.  As part of that clearance, FDA also approved instructions for use submitted by Prometheus for the rectal pressure sensor that prominently stated: “This sensor is restricted for single person use only.  Use by another person is strictly prohibited by Federal Regulations.”The government charged Ms. D’Andrea under the criminal provisions of the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), alleging that Ms. D’Andrea caused medical practitioners to engage in conduct that resulted in the rectal pressure sensors being adulterated.  Under the FDCA, a device is adulterated if it was “prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have been contaminated with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.”  As part of her guilty plea, Ms. D’Andrea acknowledged the government’s evidence that reusing the rectal pressure sensor on multiple patients, even when covered with a glove, resulted in the adulteration of the device given the risk of cross-contamination of viral and bacterial diseases.  She faces up to a year in prison.Ms. D’Andrea’s guilty plea follows the May 2020 convictions of Dr. Roger Beyer and Susan Wright who, in addition to convictions related to healthcare fraud, both pleaded guilty to counts of adulteration involving the reuse of the Prometheus rectal pressure sensor on multiple patients at Dr. Beyer’s practices. On October 29, 2020, U.S. District Judge Janet T. Neff sentenced Dr. Beyer to 57 months of incarceration, and she previously sentenced Ms. Wright to three years of probation and over 3,000 hours of community service.  Dr. Beyer and Ms. Wright, along with an office manager, paid separate civil settlements under the Federal False Claims Act totaling over $1.25 million.“The Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act plays an important role in protecting the public health and safety,” stated U.S. Attorney Birge.  “When device manufacturer representatives and medical practitioners flaunt the rules, they jeopardize the wellbeing of patients in our community.  My office is committed to working with FDA and other law enforcement to hold any other responsible parties accountable for this or other similar misconduct.”“The FDA requires medical device manufacturers to provide healthcare professionals with the important safety information, including single-use and single-user designations, that is required to protect patients’ health.  When manufacturers and their representatives blatantly disregard this safety information, they put patients’ health at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Lynda M. Burdelik, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Chicago Field Office.  “We will continue to aggressively investigate and bring to justice those who threaten the health and safety of Americans.”This case was the result of an investigation by FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in coordination with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Michigan.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Raymond E. Beckering III and Trial Attorney Ross S. Goldstein of the Justice Department’s Consumer Protection Branch are prosecuting the criminal case against Ms. D’Andrea, with subject-matter expertise and assistance from FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel and Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew J.

DuCharme, Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and Jeffrey Ebersole, Special Agent-in-Charge, Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, New York Field Office (FDA-OCI), announced the guilty plea.“With today’s guilty plea, Settino has been held accountable for stealing from his then-employer thousands of bottles of an injectable drug administered to horses, which he resold to trainers and vets potentially endangering the health of horses at New York racetracks because the stolen drugs were not handled properly,” stated Acting United States Attorney DuCharme.  “This Office will vigorously prosecute those who jeopardized drug safety.”“The FDA works to ensure that veterinary drugs are safe and effective so that animals remain healthy.  When drugs are taken out of the legitimate supply chain, there is no longer any assurance that they are safe or effective,” stated FDA-OCI Special Agent-in-Charge Ebersole.  “The FDA remains committed to investigating and bringing to justice those who endanger the health of animals.”As set forth in court filings and facts admitted in court, Settino was the production supervisor of manufacturing at Luitpold Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in Shirley, New York.  In January 2019, Luitpold was renamed American Regent.  One of the products manufactured at Luitpold and American Regent was Adequan, an injectable equine drug administered to horses with degenerative joint disease and sold throughout the United States.  Between 2012 and January 2020, Settino stole thousands of bottles of Adequan from Luitpold and American Regent valued at over $1 million and sold those drugs to horse trainers and veterinarians at New York racetracks, including Belmont Park, for more than $600,000.  Settino’s conduct potentially endangered the health of horses because the drugs were not maintained, stored or transported in accordance with proper procedures for ensuring the safety, effectiveness and efficacy of the drugs.  At times, Settino transported the drugs in shoeboxes stored in his car.  At all times, the drugs were handled in violation of the FDA regulated supply chain.The government’s case is being handled by the Office’s Long Island Criminal Division.  Assistant United States Attorney Charles P.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, December 3,2020SAN DIEGO – Dr. Jennings Ryan Staley, previously charged with one count of mail fraud, was indicted by a federal grand jury yesterday for additional crimes arising from his business venture selling COVID-19 “treatment kits,” which he advertised to one potential customer as a “miracle cure.”  Staley is a licensed physician and the former operator of Skinny Beach Med Spas in and around San Diego.According to the new charges, which became publicly available today, Staley agreed with a Chinese supplier to smuggle hydroxychloroquine powder into the U.S., lying to U.S. Customs by mislabeling a shipment as “yam extract.” Staley is also charged with stealing the name and identifying information of one of his employees in order to create and submit a bogus prescription for hydroxychloroquine on the employee’s behalf, in order to sell the drugs at a markup to his customers.In late March and early April 2020, Staley marketed and sold his treatment kits to Skinny Beach customers.  He described his product as a “concierge medicine experience,” which included hydroxychloroquine—an anti-malarial drug that Staley described to one potential customer as a “guaranteed” cure for COVID-19.  Staley’s kits were priced as high as $3,995 for a family of four, while Staley himself paid roughly $1 per tablet of hydroxychloroquine. Staley’s marketing materials, per the indictment, stressed that recipients should “NOT BELIEVE THE REPORTS THAT HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE DOESN’T WORK!”During a phone call with a prospective customer, in reality an undercover FBI agent, Staley repeatedly promised that the drugs he was selling would cure COVID-19.  According to the charging document, Staley said hydroxychloroquine “cures the disease,” and that it was “incredible,” a “magic bullet,” and an “amazing weapon.”  When the undercover agent asked if hydroxychloroquine and mefloquine—another anti-malarial that Staley described as “the Russian cure”—would effectively cure someone infected with COVID-19, Staley replied, “One hundred percent.  One hundred percent.”One week later, when interviewed by FBI agents, the indictment alleges that Staley falsely denied ever saying that the Skinny Beach treatment packages were a “one hundred percent effective cure.”“People must be able to trust their doctors to offer honest medical advice instead of a fraudulent sales pitch, especially during a global pandemic,” said U.S. Attorney Robert Brewer. “Medical professionals who lie about their treatments to profit from a desperate, fearful public will face criminal charges and serious consequences like any other lawbreaker.” Brewer praised prosecutors Nicholas Pilchak and Jaclyn Stahl as well as agents from the FBI and U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, for their excellent work on this case.“The FBI has been vigilant in investigating anyone trying to capitalize on the COVID-19 crisis,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Suzanne Turner. “It's clear that trust in our medical professionals is always important, but particularly so in current times. These additional charges emphasize the FBI's dedication to fully uncovering the extent of Dr. Staley's alleged fraudulent actions and our unwavering commitment to pursuing those who put personal greed before humanity.”The charging document outlines multiple ways that Staley obtained the hydroxychloroquine pills he resold as part of his treatment kits, including soliciting them from his acquaintances and employees with preexisting hydroxychloroquine prescriptions, and writing prescriptions for immediate family members and acquaintances to get the drugs “by any means necessary.”  He even had plans to make his own tablets of hydroxychloroquine, using the mislabeled powder he planned to smuggle in from Chinese suppliers he found online.Staley wrote one sham prescription, according to the superseding indictment, for a Skinny Beach employee.  Staley had also asked the employee for a few tablets from her own hydroxychloroquine prescription, supposedly for another Skinny Beach staff member who was sick. Instead of borrowing a few of the employee’s tablets to help a suffering colleague as he had promised, however, Staley turned around and wrote a bogus prescription using her name, date of birth, and prior home address.  Staley then took the sham prescription to multiple pharmacies to try to obtain hydroxychloroquine in the employee’s name, including by pretending to be her during the online ordering process.Staley also lied to agents about the employee whose identifying information he had stolen, falsely claiming that she had allowed him to use her pre-existing medical condition to get hydroxychloroquine tablets that he would re-sell at a significant profit.“The FDA continues its steadfast efforts to identify, investigate, and bring to justice those who attempt to profit from the pandemic by offering American consumers so-called ‘miracle cures’ to treat COVID-19,” said Special Agent in Charge Lisa L. Malinowski, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office. “We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to bring to justice those who place profits above the public health.”The superseding indictment also charges Staley with an importation crime, based on his agreement with a Chinese supplier to lie to U.S. Customs about a shipment that Staley believed contained 12 kilograms of hydroxychloroquine powder.  As alleged, when the supplier volunteered to “change the product name to export” in order to get the product through U.S. Customs by “replac[ing] hydroxychloroquine export with yam extract,” Staley replied “Excellent,” and then suggested the same mislabeling technique himself to another potential supplier.Staley later bragged to the undercover agent just days later that he “got the last tank of . . . hydroxychloroquine smuggled out of China Sunday night at 1:00 a.m. in the morning” by “saying it was sweet potato extract.”  In truth, but unbeknownst to Staley, the shipment contained only baking soda.As set out in the indictment, Staley also sought to raise money for his lucrative COVID-19 venture by soliciting investments.  He told one potential investor that, if she contributed a minimum of $25,000, he would promise to repay “triple [her] money in 90 days.”Staley’s next court date is December 17, 2020 at 11 a.m. before U.S. District Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel.If you think you are a victim of COVID-19 fraud, immediately report it to the FBI (visit ic3.gov, tips.fbi.gov, or call 1-800-CALL-FBI or the San Diego FBI at 858-320-1800; the public is also urged to report suspected fraud schemes related to COVID-19 by calling the National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF) hotline (1-866-720-5721) or by e-mailing the NCDF atdisaster@leo.gov.DEFENDANTCase Number 20cr1227-GPCJennings Ryan Staley, M.D.                           Age: 44                       Residence: San Diego, CASUMMARY OF CHARGESMail Fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1341Maximum Penalty: Twenty years in prison; fine; special assessmentImportation Contrary to Law, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 545Maximum Penalty: Twenty years in prison; fine; special assessmentFalse Statement, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001Maximum Penalty: Five years in prison; fine; special assessmentAggravated Identity Theft, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1028AMandatory minimum two years in prison; fine; special assessmentAGENCIESFederal Bureau of InvestigationU.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations*The charges and allegations contained in an indictment or complaint are merely accusations, and the defendant is considered innocent unless and until proven guilty.Topic(s):CoronavirusComponent(s):USAO - California, SouthernPress Release Number:CAS20-1203-Staley"

Brady announced today.United States District Judge Arthur J. Schwab sentenced Justin Ash, 37, to 24 months’ imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release. Ash was also ordered to forfeit a total of approximately $780,000.During his plea hearing on January 16, 2020, Ash admitted that between January 2016 and May 8, 2018, he engaged in a conspiracy to obtain unapproved drugs in bulk quantities from overseas suppliers, including suppliers in China, for the purpose of pressing the drugs into pills and distributing them to customers throughout the United States via his internet-based business Domestic RCS. Ash’s website,www.domesticrcs.com, advertised multiple unapproved or \"misbranded\" drugs—clonazolam, diclazepam, flubromazolam, and etizolam—each of which was a non-prescription benzodiazepine or substance with a similar chemical composition. As Ash further acknowledged, these substances carried risks of dependency, toxicity, and even fatal overdose, particularly when combined with other central nervous system depressants. Although his website and the packaging contained in his shipments indicated that the substances were for \"research purposes only,\" Ash admitted that he was aware that the vast majority of his customers purchased the drugs for individual consumption. Indeed, Ash or others acting at his direction communicated directly with individual customers about, among other things, the effects of the drugs when used for personal consumption. In an effort to evade detection by United States federal authorities, including the United States Food and Drug Administration, United States Postal Inspection Service, and United States Customs and Border Protection, Ash also admitted that he caused his overseas suppliers to ship drugs to multiple addresses under his control and in smaller quantities that would draw less government scrutiny.Assistant United States Attorney Eric G.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeEastern District of VirginiaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, November 20,2020ALEXANDRIA, Va. – A Maryland Darknet vendor and a Nebraska pharmacist were sentenced today to a combined over 23 years in prison for their respective roles in conspiracy to use explosives to firebomb and destroy a competitor pharmacy.According to court documents, William Anderson Burgamy IV, 33, of Hanover, Maryland, told co-conspirator, Hyrum T. Wilson, 41, of Auburn, Nebraska, that he would never surrender to law enforcement, that if anyone showed up during the attack, he would “blast [his] [expletive] way out,” and that he would shoot bullets at anyone who attempted to confront or apprehend him, including the owner of the victim pharmacy. Prior to Burgamy’s arrest in April 2020, which uncovered and thwarted the firebombing plot, Burgamy and Wilson fully intended on the attack occurring after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted.From August 2019 through April 2020, Wilson illegally mailed over 19,000 dosage units of prescription medications, including opioids, from his pharmacy in Nebraska to Burgamy’s residence in Maryland. Burgamy illegally sold prescription drugs through his Darknet vendor account to customers nationwide, including here in the Eastern District of Virginia, and claimed at one point that he made nearly $1 million total. Burgamy and Wilson laundered the proceeds of their scheme using Bitcoin cryptocurrency payments, wire transfers, and bundles of cash sent through the mail.Given the profitability of the Darknet scheme, Wilson repeatedly hit limits, set by his distributor, on the amount of prescription drugs that he could obtain and provide to Burgamy. Consequently, Burgamy and Wilson developed an attack plot known as “Operation Firewood” to break into, steal the opiate supply of, and firebomb a competing pharmacy located in Auburn by using explosives. The goal of the attack plot was to destroy Wilson’s local competition, which Burgamy and Wilson believed would increase the volume of prescription drugs that Wilson’s pharmacy could obtain, thereby allowing Burgamy and Wilson’s drug trafficking operation to continue and expand.Wilson created a “getaway” map and escape routes for Burgamy to use to help him evade law enforcement detection after the firebombing. Wilson instructed Burgamy to make the firebombing appear as though it was committed by a fictitious “pissed off husband” who learned about a fabricated affair involving the husband’s wife and a pharmacist from the victim pharmacy. Burgamy and Wilson also discussed obtaining and selling hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for illegal distribution purposes in order to further profit from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.Burgamy assured Wilson that if anything happened to him, he would take care of Wilson’s “family and bills,” and Wilson agreed to safeguard Burgamy’s life insurance information in the event Burgamy was killed during the attack. Burgamy and Wilson also agreed that Burgamy and another individual would carry multiple firearms during the attack and use explosives, specifically Molotov cocktails enhanced with Styrofoam as a thickening agent, to burn the victim pharmacy down. Law enforcement located eight unsecured fully loaded firearms in Burgamy’s residence, including AR-15 assault rifles and numerous high capacity magazines.Burgamy and Wilson were sentenced to 168 months and 112 months in prison respectively.This prosecution was part of an international enforcement operation targeting opioid traffickers on the Darknet. Operation DisrupTor, announced on September 22, was conducted across the United States and Europe and resulted in over 170 arrests worldwide, the seizure of weapons, drugs, and over $6.5 million.G.

Jones of the Western District of Virginia entered the sentence against Indivior Solutions pursuant to a plea agreement. Together with Indivior’s civil penalties, it will pay $600 million to resolve its civil and criminal liability. Altogether, the investigation and prosecution of Indivior Solutions and its parent companies, Indivior Inc. and Indivior plc, and two former Indivior executives (its CEO and Medical Director) and a resolution with Indivior’s former parent, Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, resulted in recoveries of more than $2 billion.Suboxone, which contains the powerful opioid buprenorphine, is a drug product approved for use by recovering opioid addicts to avoid or reduce withdrawal symptoms while they undergo treatment for opioid-use disorder. In connection with its guilty plea, Indivior Solutions admitted to making false statements to the Massachusetts Medicaid program (MassHealth) related to the relative safety of Suboxone Film, a version of Suboxone, around children.“Combating the opioid epidemic is a top priority for the Department of Justice,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Bossert Clark of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “We will hold drug manufacturers accountable when they make misrepresentations that could affect consumers’ access to opioid addiction treatments.”Indivior Solutions, a subsidiary of Indivior Inc., pleaded guilty on July 24, 2020, to a one-count felony criminal information charging false statements relating to health care matters.  Indivior Inc. agreed to terms complementing the Indivior Solutions guilty plea and agreed to implement prospective measures that include permanently disbanding Indivior Inc.’s Suboxone sales force and taking steps to prevent promoting Suboxone to health care providers at a high risk of inappropriate prescribing.On June 30, 2020, Indivior’s former CEO, Shaun Thaxter, pleaded guilty to a one-count misdemeanor information related to Indivior’s false and misleading representations to MassHealth. On October 22, 2020, the court sentenced Thaxter to a six-month term of incarceration and $600,000 in criminal fines and forfeiture.On August 26, 2020, Indivior’s former medical director, Tim Baxter, pleaded guilty to a one-count misdemeanor information related to Indivior’s false and misleading representations to MassHealth. Baxter’s sentencing hearing is scheduled for December 17, 2020, before Judge Jones in Abingdon, Virginia.“When a drug manufacturer claims to be part of the solution to the national opioid epidemic, we expect it to make honest representations to government officials, physicians and patients, who have to make crucial treatment decisions,” said Acting United States Attorney Daniel P. Bubar of the Western District of Virginia.  “Instead, Indivior made false statements about Suboxone’s safety to increase its sales.  I’m proud of the close relationship we have with our federal and state partners that led to today’s important result.”In its guilty plea, Indivior Solutions, which employed marketing and sales personnel for the Indivior group of companies, admitted that in October 2012 it sought to convince MassHealth to expand Medicaid coverage of Suboxone Film in Massachusetts and sent MassHealth a misleading chart and  false data indicating that Suboxone Film had the lowest rate of accidental pediatric exposure (i.e., children taking medication by accident) of all buprenorphine drugs in Massachusetts, when in fact it did not. Indivior Solutions further admitted that sending the false and misleading information occurred in the context of marketing and promotional efforts directed at MassHealth, which were overseen by top executives. MassHealth announced it would provide access to Suboxone Film for patients with children under the age of six shortly after Indivior provided the false and misleading information to agency officials.“Opioid manufacturers and distributors must be held accountable for their illegal actions in the course of this national crisis that continues to devastate families and communities across the Commonwealth,” said Attorney General Herring. “I want to thank my Medicaid Fraud Unit for their hard work on this important case and I also want to thank our local, state, and federal partners for their help and collaboration. No dollar amount or criminal punishment alone will fix this epidemic, but my team and I remain dedicated to holding these pharmaceutical companies accountable for illegal conduct related to the sales of opioids.”“The purposefully false assurances of Indivior Solutions leading to potential misuse of potent substances such as Suboxone have only added to the opioid epidemic plaguing our nation,” said Elton Malone, Assistant Inspector General for Investigations with the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  “This sentencing, along with law enforcement’s continued focus on this public health crisis, should serve as a warning that large companies cannot rely on their corporate veils to protect them from prosecution.”“The U.S. Postal Service spends billions of dollars per year in workers compensation-related costs, most of which are legitimate, said Kenneth Cleevely, Special Agent in Charge of the Eastern Field Office for the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General.. “However, when medical providers or companies choose to flout the rules and profit illegally, special agents with the USPS OIG will work with our law enforcement partners to hold them responsible.”“Pharmaceutical companies that falsely promote their drugs, intended to treat opioid addiction, as superior to other alternatives only worsens the opioid crisis that has touched far too many lives in the U.S. Such actions potentially narrow access to treatment for those who need it,” said Judy McMeekin, Pharm.D., Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs, U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who devise and participate in these schemes to the detriment of the public health.”“Suboxone is a vital treatment for patients recovering from opioid addiction, and Indivior thwarted lower-cost generic alternatives to maintain its lucrative monopoly of the drug,” said Gail Levine, a Deputy Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition. “Working closely with the DOJ, the FTC was able to secure compensation for patients harmed by Indivior’s anticompetitive scheme and ensure that the company does not engage in similar conduct in the future.”The criminal case against Indivior was prosecuted by Randy Ramseyer of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia; Albert P. Mayer and Carol Wallack of the Department of Justice Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch; Charles J. Biro and Matthew J. Lash of the Department of Justice Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch; Kristin L. Gray, Joseph S. Hall and Janine M. Myatt of the Virginia Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the Office of the Attorney General; and Garth W. Huston of the Federal Trade Commission.  This matter was investigated by the Virginia Attorney General’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit; FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigation; the United States Postal Service Office of Inspector General; and the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General.The joint effort advances the goals of the Department’s Prescription Interdiction & Litigation (PIL) Task Force to deploy all available criminal, civil, and regulatory tools to hold opioid manufacturers accountable for unlawful practices and to ensure that prescription opioid products are marketed truthfully.For more information about the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia, visit its website athttps://www.justice.gov/usao-wdva.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeWestern District of MichiganFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, October 29,2020Roger D. Beyer, M.D., Sentenced Today and Agrees to Pay Share of Civil Settlement Totaling $1.26 Million to Resolve False Claims Act AllegationsGRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN— U.S. Attorney Andrew B. Birge announced today that U.S. District Judge Janet T. Neff sentenced Roger D. Beyer, M.D., to 57 months of incarceration for his involvement in a conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud and 12 months of incarceration to run concurrently for the adulteration of medical devices. Judge Neff also ordered $5,000 in fines in conjunction with the charges as well as three years of supervised release to follow imprisonment for the health care fraud conspiracy charge and one year of supervised release for the adulteration charge. Dr. Beyer owned and operated the now-shuttered Urological Solutions of Michigan (“USM”), a mobile medical practice providing urological services to patients in their homes and assisted living facilities in the greater Traverse City, Grand Rapids, and Kalamazoo areas, and Women’s Health Care Specialists (WHCS), a gynecology practice located in Kalamazoo.Judge Neff found that Dr. Beyer engaged in several fraud schemes committed by USM and WHCS, resulting in approximately $883,000 in false claims submitted by the practices and paid by Medicare. These schemes included billing pelvic muscle rehabilitation (“PMR) therapy using improper—and more lucrative—diagnostic codes, billing for evaluation and management (“E&M”) services that did not occur, and billing for the services of an unlicensed nurse assistant.Dr. Beyer was also sentenced for the adulteration of medical devices at USM and WHCS. During the fraud investigation, investigators discovered that USM and WHCS reused a single-user rectal pressure sensor on multiple patients as part of the PMR therapy, covering the device with the finger of a surgical glove. WHCS staff also reused a single-use anorectal manometry catheter on multiple patients as part of an initial diagnostic study with patients with potential fecal incontinence, covering the device with a condom. The reuse of these medical devices was in contravention with the devices’ instructions for use and inconsistent with the device clearances by the Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”). The Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act prohibits the adulteration of medical devices, which includes holding devices under “insanitary conditions” whereby they may have been contaminated with filth or rendered injurious to health.Judge Neff enhanced Dr. Beyer’s sentencing guidelines based on the fact that an administrative law judge in 2011 ruled that USM should not bill Medicare for the PMR therapy using the diagnostic codes. Despite this explicit judicial order, Dr. Beyer and his practices continued to bill for the PMR therapy using the diagnostic codes, but submitting the billing under USM’s nurse practitioners to “fly under the radar.” Judge Neff also applied an enhancement for the reckless risk of bodily injury to patients related to the reuse of medical devices.In issuing Dr. Beyer’s sentence, Judge Neff found that Dr. Beyer’s offense was a “significant fraud on a very valuable federal program.” Judge Neff observed that the size of the Medicare program “make it a great target for fraud . . . [but] cheating the government is really cheating all of us and particularly those who need the assistance of the arm of government.” Judge Neff pointed out that while Dr. Beyer pleaded guilty “there was a gross minimization of culpability.” Judge Neff concluded that a significant term of imprisonment was necessary to promote “punishment and respect for the law” and that a sentence of less than incarceration would not sufficiently deter others from similar conduct.Dr. Beyer’s sentence follows the June 2020 sentencing of Mark Sabor, USM’s practice manager who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud and was sentenced to two years in prison. The investigation also resulted in the conviction of Dr. Beyer’s wife, Susan Wright, a nurse practitioner and attorney, who pleaded guilty to failing to report ongoing fraud at Dr. Beyer’s practice to law enforcement and also the adulteration of medical devices. In September, Judge Neff sentenced Ms. Wright to three years of probation and over 3,000 hours of community service.As part of a parallel investigation, each defendant also agreed to pay a civil settlement under the False Claims Act to resolve allegations of the submission of false claims for reimbursement to Medicare as part of the numerous alleged healthcare fraud schemes at Dr. Beyer’s practices. Ms. Wright paid $500,000; Mr. Sabor paid $150,000; and Dr. Beyer and his practices agreed to pay $610,000 within five days of sentencing.“Dr. Beyer and the other defendants engaged in a course of fraudulent conduct for many years, despite multiple warnings—including a decision by an administrative law judge—to do things the right way,” stated U.S. Attorney Birge. “But their greed-fueled misconduct didn’t just hurt the Medicare program. Instead, by reusing single-use and single-user medical equipment in these procedures on multiple patients, they recklessly risked the lives and health of their patients. The outcome of this case demonstrates that medical professionals in our district cannot flaunt Medicare billing rules or adulterate medical devices without consequence.”“U.S. consumers rely on FDA oversight to ensure that medical devices are safe and effective,” said Lynda M. Burdelik, Special Agent in Charge of FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, Chicago Field Office. “When healthcare providers disregard safety information, including single-use and single-user designations, they put patients’ health at risk. We will continue to investigate and bring to justice providers that jeopardize the public health.”“The defendants’ involvement in healthcare fraud schemes for medical services not rendered and upcoding services provided was motivated by greed,” said Lamont Pugh III, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Office of Inspector General – Chicago Region (“HHS-OIG”). “Their conduct demonstrates an aggravated indifference for the law and a disregard for the safety and well-being of vulnerable citizens given that the defendants carried on these schemes after being corrected by Medicare’s contractor and an administrative law judge and given the reuse of adulterated medical equipment on Medicare patients. HHS-OIG will continue to work with our prosecutorial and law enforcement partners to ensure that those who commit these criminal acts are held accountable.”Dr. Beyer and Susan Wright broke laws designed to protect Medicare and regulations designed to protect patient safety. Their behavior was in direct conflict with the oath they took to ‘do no harm,’” said Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) Acting Special Agent in Charge David G. Nanz. “The FBI in Michigan will continue to investigate the type of cases in which medical professionals put profits over patient safety and waste taxpayer dollars by defrauding publicly-funded medical care.”This case was the result of a joint investigation by HHS-OIG, FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, and the FBI, in coordination with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Michigan. Assistant U.S. Attorney Raymond E. Beckering III prosecuted the criminal case, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Hull represented the United States in the civil case.###Topic(s):Health Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - Michigan, Western"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeEastern District of KentuckyFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, October 29,2020FRANKFORT, Ky. –A compounding pharmacy based in Nicholasville, and its owner, admitted on Thursday in federal court to unlawful distribution of compounded prescription drugs.Tailor Made Compounding LLC (TMC) pleaded guilty to one count of distributing unapproved new drugs throughout the United States, from October 25, 2018 through April 1, 2020, before U.S. District Judge Gregory F. Van Tatenhove. Specifically, TMC pleaded guilty to unlawful distribution of selective androgen receptor modulators (“SARMS”) and other substances that the FDA had not approved for distribution in the United States. SARMS are synthetic chemicals designed to mimic the effects of testosterone and other anabolic steroids. Products containing SARMS were often marketed and sold for body-building purposes. According to the plea agreement, TMC also unlawfully distributed other unapproved new drugs, including BPC 157, Cerebrolysin, CJC 1295, DSIP, Epitalon, GW 501516, Ipamorelin, LGD-4033, LL-37, Melanotan II, MK 677, PEG-MGF, Selank, and Semax. In connection with the plea, TMC agreed to forfeit $1,788,906.82, representing its 2019 sales for these products.Jeremy Delk, 40, pleaded guilty to one count of unlawfully engaging in wholesale distribution of a prescription drug, without licensing TMC as a wholesale distributor with the Board of Pharmacy for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. According to the plea agreement, from October 23, 2018 through May 14, 2020, TMC sent 112 vials of Methylcobalamin 10mg/ml 10mL, a prescription form of vitamin B12, to Doctor 1, a licensed physician who operated an anti-aging/wellness clinic in the Greater Los Angeles area. Rather than sending individualized, patient-specific prescriptions to TMC, as is required by law, Doctor 1 made bulk orders of Methylcobalamin 10mg/ml 10mL without issuing prescriptions or providing accurate patient names. Delk, as owner and chief executive officer of TMC, knowingly caused TMC to fill and ship bulk, wholesale distributions of Methylcobalamin to Doctor 1, knowing that TMC had never applied for permission from the Kentucky Board of Pharmacy for TMC to act as a wholesale distributor of prescription drugs. When authorities from the FDA and the Kentucky Board of Pharmacy inspected TMC between August 20 and October 24, 2018, Delk took steps to hide records of TMC’s wholesale distributions of Methylcobalamin, as well as other records.Tailor Made and Delk were charged by way of information, waiving their right to indictment by a federal grand jury.“The safety and efficacy of prescription medications is of paramount importance to us all,” said Robert M. Duncan, Jr., United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky. “When pharmacies intentionally evade the FDA requirements, they are placing their own interests above those of the patients they are supposed to be serving. The community deserves better, and I commend the work of our law enforcement partners in their diligent efforts to protect the public and disrupt this criminal conduct.”“Compounded drugs can serve an important role for patients whose medical needs cannot be met by an FDA-approved drug product. But pharmacies will be held responsible for failing to follow the laws intended to protect patients, including requirements for licensure and limitations on what drugs can be appropriately compounded,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who put profits above a patient’s health.”United States Attorney Duncan; Mark S. McCormack, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Metro Washington Field Office; and James Robert Brown, Jr., Special Agent in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation jointly announced the guilty plea.The investigation was conducted by the FDA and the FBI. The United States was represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Kate K. Smith.Delk and Tailor Made Compounding are scheduled to be sentenced on February 24, 2021. Delk faces up to 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000. However, any sentence will be imposed by the Court, after its consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the applicable federal statutes.– END –Attachment(s):Download 2020-10-29_delk_rearraignment.pdfComponent(s):USAO - Kentucky, EasternCONTACT: Gabrielle Dudgeon PHONE: (859) 685-4887 E-MAIL:gabrielle.dudgeon@usdoj.gov"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeEastern District of VirginiaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, September 30,2020ALEXANDRIA, Va. – An attorney, pharmacist, and sales representative have each pleaded guilty to conspiracy to pay or receive health care kickbacks.“Health care fraud harms us all and steals valuable resources from those who are in need,” said G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. “Our office and our law enforcement partners will continue to devote its resources and time to uncovering and detecting health care fraud and those individuals who put their greed above the interests of the public good.”According to court documents, Daniel Tyler Walker, 50, of Lewes, Delaware, Michael Beatty, 53, of Pasadena, Maryland, and Seth Myers, 52, of Crystal Lake, Illinois, pleaded guilty to engaging in a conspiracy where each defendant either paid or received money in an effort to induce or reward the referral of health care services payable by federal health care programs, including TRICARE, a health care program for uniformed service members, retirees, and their families, Medicare, and Medicaid. In total, the related conspiracies involved millions of dollars of health care kickback payments.“These pleas demonstrate what happens when medical professionals and those around them betray the public’s trust in the medical system to satisfy their own greed,” said Robert E. Bornstein, Acting Special Agent in Charge of FBI Washington Field Office Criminal Division. “The abuse of the healthcare system can divert federal funds from where they are truly needed, which can put our most vulnerable citizens at risk. The FBI and its local, state and federal partners, are fully committed to identifying individuals who chose to prioritize their own interests in place of appropriate medical care for patients, and we will continue to work with our partners to bring them justice.”According to court documents, Walker was a medical sales specialist for a pharmaceutical company headquartered in the Eastern District of Virginia. In connection with this role, Walker conspired with the owner of Royal Care Pharmacy to engage in a kickback scheme in which Walker received payments from Royal Care Pharmacy and its affiliate entities in exchange for referring and directing health care providers to have prescriptions for a drug manufactured by Walker's employer filled at Royal Care. Payments for those prescriptions were made in whole or in part under various federal health care programs, including TRICARE, Medicare, Virginia Medicaid, and Maryland Medicaid. Walker and his co-conspirators agreed that he would receive 25 percent of all net sales of the drug filled by Royal Care. During the conspiracy, Royal Care profited more than $1.2 million from the scheme, and in turn, Walker received at least $573,000 in kickbacks for his role in the fraud. As part of his plea agreement, Walker has agreed to forfeit $671,790 to the United States, which represents the proceeds that he received during the course of the conspiracy.Walker pleaded guilty on Tuesday to conspiracy to solicit and receive health care kickbacks. He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison when sentenced on Jan. 29, 2021.“The Defense Criminal Investigative Service is committed to protecting the integrity of the U.S. military health care program to provide top quality medical care to America's Warfighters and their families, while ensuring that health care providers and facilities comply with Federal laws,” said Robert E. Craig Jr., Special Agent in Charge of the DCIS Mid-Atlantic Field Office. “Through joint investigations with our law enforcement partners, DCIS aggressively pursues criminal prosecutions and all available remedies to bring violators to justice. These guilty pleas demonstrate the effectiveness of our investigative efforts.”According to court documents, Beatty was a pharmacist who practiced in Fallston, Maryland. Beatty, Seth Myers, and a physician who practiced in both Virginia and Maryland entered into a kickback arrangement in which Beatty agreed to pay a company controlled by the physician kickbacks in exchange for the physician referring prescriptions for very expensive compound drugs to Beatty and his pharmacy. Payments for these compound prescriptions were made in part by TRICARE. During the course of the conspiracy, TRICARE paid the co-conspirators a total of approximately $344,280. The pharmacy where Beatty worked made a net profit of approximately $295,782 from payments made by TRICARE for the compound prescriptions that were part of the kickback scheme. In turn, Beatty paid the physician controlled company approximately $147,891 in kickbacks.“Compounded drugs can serve an important role for patients whose medical needs cannot be met by an FDA-approved drug product. Patients should always receive the medications they need to treat their condition, not medicines that bring financial benefits to the health care provider or pharmacist,” said Mark S. McCormack, Special Agent in Charge of FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who put profits above a patient’s health.”Beatty also pleaded guilty on Tuesday to conspiracy to offer and pay health care kickbacks. He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison when sentenced on Jan. 15, 2021.According to court documents, Myers was a licensed attorney who worked with a physician that practiced in Virginia and Maryland. Myers conspired with the physician to solicit kickback payments from the owner of multiple northern Virginia-based pharmacies, including Royal Care Pharmacy, and Michael Beatty, a pharmacist, in exchange for the physician referring prescriptions for very expensive compound drugs to the pharmacies. Payments for these compound prescriptions were made in part by TRICARE. During the course of the conspiracy, TRICARE paid the pharmacies approximately $4.8 million. In turn, the pharmacies paid Myers and his physician co-conspirator approximately $2.6 million in kickback payments. As part of his plea agreement, Myers has agreed to forfeit $428,124 to the United States, which represents the proceeds that he received during the conspiracy.Myers pleaded guilty today to conspiracy to solicit and receive health care kickbacks. He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison when sentenced on Jan. 29, 2021.The Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, and FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office assisted in the investigation.Assistant U.S. Attorneys Uzo Asonye, Monika Moore, Carina Cuellar, and Jamar K.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeWestern District of VirginiaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, October 22,2020ABINGDON, VIRGINIA – Shaun Thaxter, the former chief executive officer of Indivior PLC, was sentenced today in U.S. District Court in Abingdon to 6 months in federal prison. He was also ordered to pay a fine of $100,000 and forfeit $500,000.  Thaxter pleaded guilty to a one-count misdemeanor information on June 30, 2020 for his role in causing the introduction into interstate commerce of misbranded shipments of the opioid drug Suboxone Film, a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Acting United States Attorney Daniel P. Bubar announced the sentence today.Thaxter served as Indivior’s top executive from 2009 until shortly before his guilty plea. This includes the time period prior to December 2014 when Indivior was known as Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals. When Indivior was known as Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, it was a subsidiary of British conglomerate Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB Group).  RB Group paid $1.4 billion in 2019 to resolve its liability to the United States related to the marketing of Suboxone.  On July 24, 2020, an Indivior subsidiary called Indivior Solutions pleaded guilty to a one-count felony information for false statements related to health care matters, and together with Indivior, agreed to pay an additional $600 million to resolve liability to the United States related to the marketing of Suboxone.  On August 26, 2020, Indivior’s former medical director, Timothy Baxter, pleaded guilty to a one-count misdemeanor information for a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act related to the marketing of Suboxone. Indivior Solutions and Baxter have not yet been sentenced.Suboxone Film is a drug product approved for use by recovering opioid addicts to avoid or reduce withdrawal symptoms while they undergo treatment. Suboxone’s active ingredient, buprenorphine, is a powerful and addictive opioid. Thaxter was charged in connection with Indivior’s misrepresentations regarding the safety of Suboxone Film.“While Thaxter served for years as Indivior’s chief executive, he was in a position to ensure that doctors, patients, and insurers were dealt with honestly,” Acting United States Attorney Bubar said today. “Instead, Thaxter failed to prevent efforts to build profits through misleading safety claims, which led to millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains for Indivior.  As the Court recognized today, this sentence should serve as a deterrence to other pharmaceutical executives.  Today’s sentencing is also the product of years of work and could not have happened without the close federal and state law enforcement partnerships, for which we are grateful.”“Families and communities across the Commonwealth continue to feel the devastating effects of the opioid epidemic,” said Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring. “Opioid manufacturers and their executive leadership must be held accountable for taking advantage of this country’s opioid crisis and putting profits over people. I want to thank my Medicaid Fraud Control Unit for their terrific work on this case as well as our local, state, and federal partners for their continued partnership on these cases.”“Misrepresentations made about the drug, while Thaxter ran the company, misled MassHealth about the potential risk of accidental opioid exposure.  It is inexcusable to willfully disregard requirements that treatment medications be prescribed carefully in order to protect patient health and safety,” said Elton Malone, Assistant Inspector General for Investigations with the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “With our law enforcement partners, we will continue investigating and bringing to justice those placing profits over patients in government healthcare programs.”“Opioid addiction is a significant public health crisis and addressing opioid abuse continues to be one of FDA’s top priorities. Misleading information about relative product benefits undermines efforts to provide affordable treatment to those suffering from opioid addiction,” said Judy McMeekin, Pharm.D., Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs, U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those whose schemes jeopardize public health and put Americans at risk.”“The U.S. Postal Service spends billions of dollars per year in workers compensation and health care-related costs, most of which are legitimate,” said Kenneth Cleevely, Special Agent in Charge of the Eastern Field Office for the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General. “However, when medical providers or companies choose to flout the rules and profit illegally, special agents with the USPS OIG will work with our law enforcement partners to hold them responsible. To report fraud or other criminal activity involving the Postal Service, contact USPS OIG special agents atwww.uspsoig.govor 888-USPS-OIG.”According to court documents, Thaxter had authority over Indivior’s marketing and sales of Suboxone Film which, along with other Suboxone products, generated nearly all the company’s revenue.  In 2012, Thaxter oversaw and encouraged Indivior’s efforts to secure formulary coverage for Suboxone Film from the Massachusetts Medicaid agency called MassHealth. Thaxter asked Indivior employees under his direction to devise a strategy to win preferred drug status for Suboxone Film and counteract a non-opioid competitor MassHealth was considering for opioid-addiction treatment.  Certain Indivior employees subsequently shared false and misleading safety information with MassHealth officials about Suboxone Film’s risk of accidental pediatric exposure.  Two months after receiving that false and misleading information, MassHealth announced it would provide access to Suboxone Film for Medicaid patients with children under the age of six.The criminal cases against Thaxter, Indivior, and Baxter are being prosecuted by attorneys from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia and the Department of Justice’s Civil Division, including Albert P. Mayer, Randy Ramseyer, Kristin L. Gray, Joseph S. Hall, Janine M. Myatt, Garth W. Huston, Carol Wallack, Charles J. Biro, and Matthew J. Lash.  The criminal investigation of Thaxter was handled by the Virginia Medicaid Fraud Control Unit; FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations; United States Postal Service - Office of Inspector General; and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services - Office of Inspector General.Topic(s):OpioidsComponent(s):USAO - Virginia, Western"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeNorthern District of TexasFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEMonday, August 10, 2020An anesthesiologist at the center of the $200 million Forest Park Medical Center fraud has been sentenced to five and a half years in federal prison and ordered to pay more than $82.9 million in restitution, announced U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas Erin Nealy Cox.Richard Ferdinand Toussaint, Jr. – who is already serving a 41-month federal prison sentence for a separate health care fraud conviction  – pleaded guilty to his involvement in the Forest Park scheme in March 2018, admitting to one count of conspiracy to pay health care bribes and kickbacks and one count of illegal remuneration under the Travel Act.  The 66-month sentence handed down today by U.S. District Judge Jack Zouhary will be served concurrent to the 41-month sentence.In plea papers, Dr. Toussaint, 61, acknowledged that he teamed up with co-defendant Dr. Wade Neal Barker, a bariatric surgeon, to launch Forest Park Medical Center, a physician-owned hospital for bariatric and spinal surgery patients, in 2008. Together with Forest Park hospital manager Alan Andrew Beauchamp, Dr. Toussaint, Dr. Barker, and their colleagues conspired to steer lucrative patients – particularly those with high-reimbursing, out-of-network private insurance – to the now defunct hospital by paying surgeons for referrals.Most of the kickbacks, which totaled more than $40 million, were disguised as consulting fees or “marketing money,” doled as a percentage of surgeries each doctor referred to Forest Park, Dr. Toussaint admitted. Email correspondence proved he and Dr. Baker were kept up to date about how much surgeons were being paid.Instead of billing patients for out-of-network co-payments, instituted by insurers to de-incentivize the high costs associated with out-of-network treatment, Forest Park allegedly waived co-insurance, assured patients they would pay in-network prices. Because they knew insurers wouldn’t tolerate such practices, they concealed the patient discounts and wrote off the difference as uncollected “bad debt.”Dr. Toussaint was one of 18 convicted in the scheme.Defendants who pleaded guilty before trial include: Wade Neal Barker, Alan Andrew Beauchamp, Kelly Wade Loter, David Daesung Kim, Israel Ortiz, Andrea Kay Smith, Frank Gonzales, Jr., Andrew Jonathan Hillman, and Semyon Narosov.Defendants convicted at trial include: Wilton McPherson “Mac” Burt, Jackson Jacob, Douglas Sung Won, Michael Bassem Rimlawi, Shawn Mark Henry, Mrugeshkumar Shah, and Iris Kathleen Forrest.The case was investigated by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Department of Labor Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Labor Employee Benefits Security Administration, the U.S. Department of Defense - Defense Criminal Investigative Service, and Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, with assistance from the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations.

        "content": "Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, October 21,2020A Texas grand jury charged the former president of ice cream manufacturer Blue Bell Creameries L.P. with wire fraud and conspiracy in connection with an alleged scheme to cover up the company’s sales of Listeria-tainted ice cream in 2015, the Justice Department announced today.In an indictment filed in federal court in Austin, Texas, former Blue Bell president Paul Kruse was charged with seven counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud related to his alleged efforts to conceal from customers what the company knew about Listeria contamination in certain Blue Bell products. According to the indictment, Texas state officials notified Blue Bell in February 2015 that two ice cream products from the company’s Brenham, Texas, factory tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes, a dangerous pathogen that can lead to serious illness or death in vulnerable populations such as pregnant women, newborns, the elderly, and those with compromised immune systems.  Kruse allegedly orchestrated a scheme to deceive certain Blue Bell customers, including by directing employees to remove potentially contaminated products from store freezers without notifying retailers or consumers about the real reason for the withdrawal.  The indictment alleges that Kruse directed employees to tell customers who asked about the removal that there was an unspecified issue with a manufacturing machine.  The company did not immediately recall the products or issue any formal communication to inform customers about the potential Listeria contamination.“American consumers trust that the individuals who lead food manufacturing companies will put the public safety before profits,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Bossert Clark of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department of Justice will take appropriate action against those who ship contaminated products and choose not to tell consumers about known risks.”“U.S. consumers rely on food producers and suppliers to ensure the safety of the nation’s food supply.  The charges announced today show that if an individual violates food safety rules or conceals relevant information, we will seek to hold them accountable,” said Judy McMeekin, Pharm.D., Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who jeopardize public health.”“The Defense Criminal Investigative Service's number one priority is the safety and well-being of America's warfighters and their families,\" said Michael Mentavlos, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Department of Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) Southwest Field Office.  “The results of this investigation are an example of DCIS' determination to enforce food safety standards, as required by Defense Department contracts.  These standards not only protect individuals, but are paramount to military readiness.”The indictment, returned Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, further alleges that March 2015 tests conducted by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) linked the strain of Listeria in one of the Blue Bell ice cream products to a strain that sickened five patients at a Kansas hospital with listeriosis, the severe illness caused by ingestion of Listeria-contaminated food.  The FDA, CDC, and Blue Bell issued public recall notifications on March 13, 2015.  Subsequent tests confirmed Listeria contamination in a product made at another Blue Bell facility in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, which resulted in a second recall announcement on March 23, 2015. Additional positive test results ultimately led Blue Bell to recall all ice cream products in April 2015.Blue Bell pleaded guilty in a related case in May to two counts of distributing adulterated food products in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. On Sept. 17, 2020, the court sentenced the company to pay criminal penalties totaling $17.25 million. Blue Bell also agreed to pay an additional $2.1 million to resolve civil False Claims Act allegations regarding ice cream products manufactured under insanitary conditions and sold to federal facilities, including the military.  The total $19.35 million in fine, forfeiture, and civil settlement payments constitutes the second largest-ever amount paid in resolution of a food safety matter.Blue Bell temporarily closed all of its plants in late April 2015 to clean and update its facilities. Since re-opening its facilities in late 2015, Blue Bell has taken significant steps to enhance sanitation processes and enact a program to test products for Listeria prior to shipment.Kruse was previously charged by criminal information on May 1, 2020, during the temporary closure of grand juries in the Western District of Texas due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  That criminal information later was dismissed without opposition from the government, and the new indictment returned by the grand jury, which has resumed operations, now sets out the charges against Kruse.The indictment filed against Kruse merely alleges that crimes have been committed.  All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.Patrick Hearn and Matt Lash of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch are prosecuting the case with assistance from Shannon Singleton of the FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel.  The criminal investigation was conducted by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations and the DCIS.For more information about the enforcement efforts of the Consumer Protection Branch, visit their website athttp://www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch.Attachment(s):Download Krus IndictmentTopic(s):False Claims ActComponent(s):Civil DivisionPress Release Number:20-1139"

Murray announced today.According to court documents and statements made in court, Coleman worked as a pharmacy technician for a retail pharmacy chain in Nashua.  In January 2019, she agreed to deliver two prescriptions to an elderly patient, which was not part of her ordinary job responsibilities.  After the delivery, the patient checked her bottles and discovered several pills were missing from her oxycodone prescription.  Further, some of the pills in the bottle were larger and had a different imprint than the others, and were later determined to be baclofen, a non-scheduled drug indicated as a muscle relaxant and anti-spasmodic agent. Coleman admitted to law enforcement officers that she replaced some of the oxycodone in the prescription bottle with the baclofen and gave the stolen oxycodone to a friend to sell, for which she received $80.Additional investigation revealed that Coleman had been stealing Suboxone from the pharmacy for her personal use. Coleman admitted that she had stolen a strip a day for approximately one year.Coleman is scheduled to be sentenced on January 28, 2021.“Drug diversion and tampering with consumer products are serious crimes that can endanger the lives of patients,” said U.S. Attorney Murray.  “When criminals steal controlled substances and replace them with other drugs, patients are not only deprived of needed medicine but also may take a drug that they should not be taking.  In some circumstances, this can create serious medical risks.  In order to protect the health and safety of our citizens, we will not hesitate to pursue federal charges against health care workers who steal drugs from innocent victims.”This matter was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, the Drug Enforcement Administration Diversion Control Division, and the Nashua Police Department.  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles L.

        "content": "Department of JusticeA federal court in Texas sentenced two former dietary supplement company executives to prison and ordered two companies to pay a combined $10.7 million in criminal forfeiture for their roles in fraudulently selling popular workout supplements, the Justice Department announced today.On Oct. 13, 2020, U.S. District Judge Sam A. Lindsay sentenced former USPlabs CEO Jacobo Geissler, 44, of University Park, Texas, to 60 months’ imprisonment. On October 15, Judge Lindsay sentenced former USPLabs president Jonathan Doyle, 41, of Dallas, to 24 months’ imprisonment. In addition, the Court ordered each defendant to pay a criminal fine of $250,000. The Court previously sentenced USPlabs to pay $4.7 million in criminal forfeiture, and sentenced another company, SK Laboratories Inc., to forfeit $6 million in connection with the case. All of the defendants were charged in a 2015 indictment returned by a federal grand jury in the Northern District of Texas.“Consumers rely on dietary supplement manufacturers to accurately represent the ingredients in their products and ensure that they are safe to consume,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Bossert Clark of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.  “We will tirelessly investigate and prosecute individuals and companies that place profits before the safety of consumers.”“Dietary supplement companies cannot be allowed to deceive their consumers and hide the fact that they are including untested ingredients in their products,” said U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas Erin Nealy Cox. “We are committed to holding people who harm consumers accountable for their unconscionable behavior.”“Consumers of dietary supplements do not expect the products they purchase to put their health at risk. Distributing supplements that jeopardize consumer health by being falsely or misleadingly labeled will not be tolerated. The FDA will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who endanger the public’s health and violate the law,” said Judy McMeekin, Pharm.D., Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs, U.S. Food and Drug Administration.“The defendants in this case thought they could profit off the boom in dietary supplements, while blatantly concealing the true nature of the products they were peddling,” said Assistant Special Agent in Charge Kevin Caramucci, Dallas Field Office. “IRS-CI is proud to stand with our federal partners in investigating financial crimes that bilk millions of dollars from our honest taxpayers, especially when products such as those distributed by Mr. Geissler and Mr. Doyle caused so much harm.”The defendants each played roles in developing, manufacturing, or marketing the popular workout and weight loss supplements known as Jack3d and OxyElite Pro, which were distributed by USPlabs. In pleading guilty last year to conspiracy to introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce, Doyle and Geissler admitted that they imported substances with false and misleading labeling to avoid law enforcement and regulatory agency attention. SK Laboratories pleaded guilty to introduction of misbranded food into interstate commerce, and USPlabs pleaded guilty to conspiracy to introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce. The misbranding charges relate in part to OxyElite Pro, which was recalled in 2013 in the wake of an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration into whether the supplement caused liver injuries in consumers. The indictment alleged that the defendants sold some of their products without determining whether they would be safe to use.Three other individuals also pleaded guilty and are expected to be sentenced in the coming months. Cyril Willson, 39, of Ralston, Nebraska, and Matthew Hebert, 42, of Dallas, pleaded guilty to introducing misbranded food into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud or mislead. Sitesh Patel, 37, of Irvine, California, the vice president of S.K. Laboratories, a California dietary supplement manufacturer, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce and to the introduction of misbranded food into interstate commerce.According to the indictment, sales of USPlabs products related to the conspiracy brought the company hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. The indictment alleged that the defendants participated in a conspiracy to import dietary supplement ingredients from China, including the stimulant known as “DMAA,” using false certificates of analysis and false labeling, and then lied about the source and nature of those ingredients. According to the indictment, the defendants told some of their retailers and wholesalers that USPlabs products contained natural plant extracts, when in fact they contained a synthetic stimulant manufactured in a Chinese chemical factory.The case was investigated by Special Agent Chad Medaris and former Special Agent Liam Gimon of FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations and Special Agent Larissa Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys David Sullivan, Patrick Runkle, and Raquel Toledo with the Consumer Protection Branch of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division, and Assistant United States Attorneys Errin Martin and John DelaGarza of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas.Additional information about the Consumer Protection Branch and its enforcement efforts may be found athttp://www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of UtahDistributed More Than a Half Million Fentanyl-Laced Oxycodone Pills on the Dark NetSALT LAKE CITY – Aaron Michael Shamo, the CEO of a nationwide dark net drug trafficking organization that distributed more than a half million counterfeit pills throughout the country, will serve life in federal prison after engaging in, and being convicted of, the most serious offense in the Controlled Substance Act.  U.S. District Judge Dale A. Kimball imposed the sentence Thursday morning in Salt Lake City.A federal jury found Shamo guilty of organizing and directing a drug trafficking organization that imported fentanyl and alprazolam from China and used the drugs to manufacture fake oxycodone pills made with fentanyl and counterfeit Xanax tablets following a trial in August 2019.  Forty-seven witnesses testified at trial and hundreds of exhibits were received into evidence.The jury convicted Shamo, 30, of Cottonwood Heights, Utah, of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, three counts of aiding and abetting the importation of a controlled substance, possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, manufacture of a controlled substance, and two counts of knowing and intentional adulteration of drugs while held for sale. The jury also found Shamo guilty of aiding and abetting the use of the U.S. Mail in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense, conspiracy to commit money laundering, money laundering promotion and concealment, and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. Shamo was found guilty on 12 of the 13 counts in the indictment.  The jury did not make a decision on the aiding and abetting the distribution of fentanyl resulting in death count.The nation’s opioid crisis was in full effect by the end of 2016, when Shamo was distributing his fentanyl-laced oxycodone around the country. Shamo distributed the controlled substances to other individuals for distribution in all 50 states using their storefront, PHARMA-MASTER, on the Dark Net marketplace AlphaBay and the U.S. mail. Federal law enforcement agents and prosecutors say an undercover purchase of 100 oxycodone pills is a substantial step in a drug investigation. Shamo sold more than half a million fentanyl-laced pills on the dark net.  He also sold hundreds of thousands of fentanyl pills locally. Prosecutors told the jury that Shamo became the person he set out to be – the Pharma Master.Evidence at trial showed Shamo did the things leader and organizers do. He was in control of the majority of the functions of the enterprise.  He established the dark web store front, hired employees, took charge of marketing and product placement. He was a drug dealer to other drug dealers. He had the contacts in China and ordered the fentanyl.  Most significantly, investigators were led to Shamo as they followed the proceeds of the drug trafficking organization. He had sole access to incoming bitcoin payments from customers. Shamo referred to the organization as his baby and his empire, prosecutors argued at trial.Shamo developed the fentanyl product through a dangerous “trial and error” process as he distributed it to individuals across the country, evidence showed.  Experts say 1 milligram of fentanyl in a pill can have dangerous consequences up to and including death. Shamo received messages from customers that they were getting sick.  His response, prosecutors said, was to send more pills to the complaining customers.  There was no shortage of fake pain pills.  Co-defendants in the case, who were responsible for packaging and shipping, used a vacuum to clean up pills from the floor because they believed it was not worth their time to pick them up because of the volume of pills they were manufacturing.“Aaron Shamo knew the nation was on fire with opioids and he poured fuel on the flames, over and over and over, never getting burned himself, but causing pain and misery wherever his fire spread.  Aaron Shamo could be considered the face of the opioid epidemic. He was a profiteer, callously making millions of dollars and living a life of leisure while exploiting those suffering through opioid addiction,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Vernon Stejskal said in  closing argument during the trial.In their sentencing memorandum, federal prosecutors told the Court that the true scope of the defendant’s victims cannot be calculated.  Since Shamo sold the fentanyl-laced fake oxycodone pills in bulk to redistributors, the end users of the pills could not always be located by investigators. Evidence shows that more than 90 individuals died from subsequent overdoses.“The defendant’s history and characteristics support the imposition of a life sentence.  The defendant dedicated himself to building his drug trafficking empire and becoming rich.  The defendant also new about the acute dangers of fentanyl but continued to produce fentanyl-laced fake oxycodone pills at an ever-increasing rate prior to his arrest,” prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memorandum. “Dark net drug traffickers falsely operate under the assumption that they are anonymous and untouchable.  Dark net drug traffickers see the immense profit potential for the highest-volume sellers of opioids online – sellers like Shamo. A life sentence would deter current and future dark net drug traffickers,” they wrote.“Shamo’s drug trafficking organization is a graphic example of the dangers in drug trafficking and the harm it causes individuals, families, and communities. At least 90 of Shamo’s retail customers have died.  Because Shamo’s organization supplied pills to other drug distributors on a wholesale basis, it is impossible to know for sure how many have perished in this illicit drug network. Most of Shamo’s profit hinged on fentanyl-laced fake pain pills, and fentanyl is an extraordinarily poisonous substance,” U.S. Attorney John W. Huber said. “Congress mandated the life sentence imposed today, which implies that a bi-partisan majority of our nation’s policymakers agreed on this significant sentence for circumstances like those found in Shamo’s conduct,” Huber said.\"In 2016, Shamo sold 1 million fentanyl-laced fake oxycodone pills to unsuspecting buyers in every state in the union. While the total harm he caused can never be measured, at least 90 of his known customers have died from overdoses. The Court’s sentence today—life imprisonment—brings justice to the families of his deceased customers and everyone else affected by his crimes. The Attorney General’s Office extends its deepest sympathies to the families of the deceased, recognizing that not even a just sentence can restore what was lost. We remain fully engaged in our effort to combat the opioid epidemic by aggressively investigating and prosecuting drug dealers who prey on the addicted,\" Utah Attorney General Sean D. Reyes said.“The tragedy of the opioid crisis continues to this day, fueled in large part by those who use every method available, including the Dark Web, to sell their illicit goods to those with substance abuse addictions,\" said Catherine Hermsen, Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations- FDA Office of Criminal Investigations.  “The FDA will continue to work with its law enforcement partners to protect the public health and disrupt and dismantle illegal prescription drug manufacturing and distribution.”“Aaron Shamo profited off of the pain and suffering of others in the hopes of becoming rich and famous. Shamo deserves to be held accountable for his actions. This investigation highlights the on-going struggle that our country faces with opioid addiction and the cooperative efforts needed to successfully dismantle criminal organizations targeting our neighborhoods,” Michael J. Tinkler, Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the DEA’s Utah District Office, said.“Today’s sentence is the result of a collaborative investigation between federal, state and local partners and exemplifies our commitment to dismantle major narcotics and money laundering operations in Utah,” said Eric Balliet, Deputy Special Agent in Charge of U.S. Homeland Security Investigations, Denver.  “As this case shows, you can’t hide on the dark net. HSI will continue to use its considerable technological expertise to investigate criminals like Shamo who push dangerous drugs into our neighborhoods and contribute to the epidemic of opioid addiction in our country.”“Mr. Shamo put at risk countless individuals addicted to opioids, through the sale of dangerous counterfeit fentanyl-laced pills. His drug empire affected the entire nation and today Mr. Shamo and the United States people received their justice,” said IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge, Tara Sullivan. “We will continue to work together with our law-enforcement partners to dismantle criminal enterprises like Mr. Shamo’s, who intend to financially profit from the exploitation and suffering of our communities and Americans as a whole.”“The conviction and sentencing of Aaron Shamo is an excellent example of multiple law enforcement agencies combining their expertise and resources to work on the common goal of taking down dark web vendors.  These vendors work under the belief they are anonymous, selling dangerous narcotics such as the deadly fentanyl uncovered in this investigation.  U.S. Postal Inspectors are committed to continuing our work to dismantle drug trafficking operations to keep USPS customers and employees safe from greedy drug traffickers who favor profit over human lives,” stated Inspector in Charge Melisa Llosa of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Phoenix Division.”A restitution hearing in the case will be held in November.Assistant U.S. Attorney Vernon Stejskal of the U.S. Attorney’s Office and Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michael Gadd and Kent A. Burggraaf prosecuted the case.  Gadd and Burggraaf are Assistant Attorneys General in the Utah Attorney General’s Office.  Special agents of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Investigations, DEA, IRS-Criminal Investigation, the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, and Postal Inspectors with the U.S. Postal Inspection Service investigated the case.Topic(s):Drug TraffickingOpioidsComponent(s):USAO - Utah"

Acting United States Attorney Daniel P. Bubar made the announcement today following the guilty plea hearing.Lewis, 34, of Roanoke, pleaded guilty today to one count of tampering with a consumer product. At sentencing he faces up to 10 years in prison.“Medical workers violate the public’s trust when they divert powerful narcotics for illicit use,” Acting United States Attorney Bubar said today. “We will continue to partner with the FDA, DEA, and others, to bring to justice anyone who violates that trust and brings potential harm to patients.”“The FDA oversees the U.S. drug supply to ensure that the medicines are safe and effective; those who knowingly tamper with medicines put patients’ health at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office. “We will continue to protect the public health and bring to justice health care professionals who take advantage of their unique position and compromise their patients’ health and comfort by tampering with needed drugs.”According to court documents, in January 2018 an employee at Home Choice Partners in Roanoke discovered a needle, alcohol pad, and a bloody tissue in the toilet of an employee bathroom and reported it to another employee. When asked by that employee if he knew anything about the items, Lewis said the items may have fallen out of his pocket. The employee contacted human resources and a decision was made to drug test all employees.Lewis, who was scheduled to be off work on the day of the drug test, was instructed to report to work to be administered a drug screening. However, Lewis contacted an employee and explained that he was the employee responsible for the items in the toilet. When asked, Lewis explained he had been engaging in such conduct for nine months. Lewis admitted there was a 50 ml vial of hydromorphone in the back of the narcotics cabinet that did not contain hydromorphone, but instead had been replaced, by him, with saline.The investigation of the case was conducted by the U.S. Food, Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Virginia State Police, and the Virginia Department of Health Professions.

Both Viagra and Cialis can be obtained in the U.S. only with a prescription from a doctor.In order to evade import restrictions, the Momins’ China-based suppliers mislabeled the boxes containing the illegal pills to make it appear that the boxes contained items that can be legally imported into the U.S., such as beauty products, health products, and health supplies. The Momins admitted to selling between $550,000 and $1.5 million in illegal drug products over the course of the conspiracy. They also sold various counterfeit goods from their warehouse in Dalton, Georgia, including counterfeit designer watches, headphones, e-cigarette devices, and tobacco rolling papers.Earlier, in October 2013, the Momins both applied to become naturalized U.S. citizens. On his application form, Irfanali Momin falsely stated that he had never been married before and did not disclose that he had in fact been married to two women at the same time. During an interview with USCIS in June 2014, Irfanali Momin made the same false declarations. Based upon his false statements, Irfanali Momin became a naturalized U.S. citizen on August 16, 2014. On her application form, Shiba I. Momin a/k/a Saguftabanu Momin, falsely stated that she did not go by any other names when in fact she knew that her actual name was Shiba I. Momin, but she was only passing as Saguftabanu Momin. The investigation had revealed that Shiba I. Momin had originally obtained a Georgia’s driver’s license in her real name only to later obtain a fraudulent license in the name Saguftabanu Momin—the name she used to apply for and fraudulently receive U.S. citizenship on August 1, 2014. If USCIS had been aware of these facts, it would have denied her citizenship.Irfanali Momin, 48, and Shiba I. Momin a/k/a Saguftabanu Momin, 42, both of Dahlonega, Georgia, were convicted on September 23, 2020 after pleading guilty to a criminal information. Sentencing for the Momins is scheduled for January 7, 2021, at 11:00 a.m., before U.S. District Judge Steve C. Jones. The Momins were originally arrested on January 8, 2020 after a grand jury returned a multi-count Indictment against them. As a consequence of their guilty pleas to naturalization fraud, Judge Jones will sign an order following sentencing that revokes their U.S. citizenship.This case is being investigated by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, Homeland Security Investigations, and the Federal Bureau of InvestigationAssistant U.S. Attorney Alex R.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeEastern District of PennsylvaniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, September 18,2020PHILADELPHIA— United States Attorney William M. McSwain announced that Thomas J. Whalen, D.O., 65, of Berwyn, PA, has agreed to pay the United States $1,257,499.00 to resolve allegations under the False Claims Act that he submitted or caused the submission of false claims to federal health care plans for FDA-approved versions of Remicade, Orencia, Prolia/Xgeva, Synvisc/Synvisc One, and Boniva when he had, in fact, administered non-FDA-approved, foreign versions of these medications.In addition, the civil settlement resolves admissions that Whalen knowingly and intentionally prescribed controlled substances outside the usual course of professional practice and without a legitimate medical purpose, in violation of the Controlled Substances Act. Whalen permanently surrendered his controlled substance registrations with the DEA, surrendered his medical license, and will be excluded from participation in federal programs.Whalen owned and operated Rheumatology Consultants, P.C., doing business as Whalen Rheumatology Group, with locations in Havertown, PA, Exton, PA, and Wilmington, DE. As part of his practice, Whalen used medications administrated by injection and infusion to treat his patients. These medications, including Remicade Synvisc, Synvisc-One, Orencia, Prolia/Xgeva, and Boniva, are made of living cells and are expensive. Rather than purchase FDA-approved versions of these medicines from authorized distributors, Whalen devised a scheme to purchase much cheaper foreign, non-FDA-approved versions of these medications. Unbeknownst to his patients, Whalen injected or infused them with the non-FDA-approved medications and then billed health care programs as if he had used the approved medications and pocketed approximately $1.1 million in illicit gains.Whalen also prescribed oxycodone to patients abusing illicit drugs. Whalen admitted to unlawful distribution of a controlled substance to two of his patients to whom he prescribed oxycodone, despite receiving multiple urine drug screening results for each that revealed the patients simultaneously abused cocaine and heroin.In December 2019, Whalen also pleaded guilty before United States District Court Judge Timothy J. Savage to related criminal charges of one count of health care fraud, one count of importation contrary to law, and two counts of distributing and dispensing oxycodone outside the course of professional practice and not for a legitimate medical purpose. He was sentenced this week to one day incarceration, followed by 12 months home confinement, three years supervised release and a $25,000 fine.“Whalen prioritized lining his own pockets over his patient’s safety,” said U.S. Attorney McSwain. “By duping his patients and health care programs alike, he stole more than $1.1 million. On top of that, he also unlawfully distributed oxycodone to patients he knew were using cocaine and heroin. These are egregious, inexcusable violations of the trust that was placed in him as a medical professional.”Regarding the resolution of the civil suit allegations, U.S. Attorney McSwain also stated: “This settlement illustrates my Office’s dedication to ensuring that physicians who engage in submission of false claims and the illegal distribution of opioids and other controlled substances are held accountable with all of our civil enforcement tools, as well as our criminal tools. My Office’s Health Care Fraud Strike Force, Civil Division, and Forfeiture staff continue to aggressively investigate doctors who violate their duties, so that we can deter and punish illegal opioid prescribing and health care fraud.”“Dr. Whalen administered non-FDA approved drugs, which placed patients’ health at risk” said Special Agent in Charge Maureen Dixon of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General’s (HHS-OIG) Philadelphia Office. “Such medications are not paid for by Medicare due to the risk they may pose to patient health. HHS-OIG, along with our law enforcement partners, will continue to protect the public and root out dangerous and costly fraud schemes.”“Dr. Whalen dispensed oxycodone, a highly addictive controlled substance medication, to individuals who he knew were already abusing cocaine and heroin. He did so without first establishing a professional doctor-patient relationship with these individuals and dispensed the oxycodone to them without any legitimate medical purpose. Instead of using his professional standing to help these individuals addicted to illicit street drugs, Dr. Whalen used his medical license to harm them in the name of making money, ” said Jonathan A. Wilson, Special Agent in Charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) Philadelphia Field Division. “Whalen’s crimes enabled his patients’ substance use disorder rather than treating it appropriately.”“The opioid epidemic that continues to spread across our nation is fueled by the illegal procurement and distribution of drugs such as OxyContin,” said Norbert E. Vint, Deputy Inspector General Performing the Duties of the Inspector General, OPM OIG. “Dr. Whalen’s scheme not only defrauded the federal health insurance carriers, but also put patients at grave risk through his unlawful distribution of controlled substances for no legitimate medical purpose. This guilty plea and settlement sends a clear message to those engaged in fraudulent conduct contributing to the opioid crisis that we will hold providers accountable. I applaud the hard work of our investigative staff and our law enforcement partners.”“U.S. consumers rely on FDA oversight to ensure that the drugs they receive are safe and effective. Rogue health care professionals who obtain foreign unapproved medicines and then dispense and administer those drugs to their patients, put the health of those patients at significant risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who choose to put the public’s health at such risk.”The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General; the Drug Enforcement Administration; Homeland Security Investigations; the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations; the Office of Personnel Management, Office of Inspector General; and the Federal Bureau of Investigation all investigated the case. Trial Attorney Debra Jaroslawicz with the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant United States Attorney Paul J. Koob prosecuted the criminal case.

Grinstead, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Kansas City Field Office. “We will continue to protect the public health and bring to justice health care professionals who take advantage of their unique position and compromise their patients’ health and comfort by tampering with needed drugs.”James Poole, 37, of Webb City, Missouri, waived his right to a grand jury and pleaded guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge David P. Rush to a federal information that charges him with one count of tampering with a consumer product.On Jan. 23, 2020, paramedics with Mercy Medical Center in Carthage, Mo., noticed what appeared to be puncture marks on a fentanyl vial that was being used to administer the pain-killing medication to a patient. Paramedics then reported a second incident in which they drew fentanyl from a vial, into a syringe, and observed that there was not enough fluid in the vial to administer a dose to the patient.The remaining narcotics in the ambulances and the office stock were examined by officials at Mercy Carthage EMS, who observed that the fentanyl and hydromorphone on the ambulances and in the office stock appeared to have visible signs of tampering. The Mount Vernon Mercy EMS facility supplies were also examined since the facility is a sister ambulance location to the Carthage facility, with the same paramedics working at both locations. Officials observed signs of tampering for one fentanyl vial that were similar to those observed at the Carthage facility.On the same day, officials with Mercy Medical Center in Springfield, Mo., contacted the Federal Drug Administration-Office of Criminal Investigations. Mercy Medical Center officials reported that 26 fentanyl and 43 hydromorphone vials appeared to have physical signs of tampering. Officials with Mercy Medical Center had the vials that were identified as being tampered with tested, and lab reports revealed that the vials had some of their original contents replaced with either saline or water solution.Supervisors and other personnel were drug tested on the date the tampering was discovered, and Poole tested positive for norfentanyl, an analog of fentanyl.Poole admitted that he was an opioid addict and had been since he was injured in an ambulance accident in December 2018. Poole admitted that he tampered with and stole 50mcg fentanyl on an EMS call that he responded to approximately three weeks earlier, on Jan. 1, 2020, before the additional tampering was discovered and he was drug tested. Poole admitted he documented giving a patient with abdominal pain 100 mcg of fentanyl, but tampered with the dosage by only administered 50 mcg to the patient. Poole stole the syringe with the remaining narcotic and injected himself with the remaining fentanyl after his shift.Under federal statutes, Poole is subject to a sentence of up to 10 years in federal prison without parole. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes, as the sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the court based on the advisory sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the United States Probation Office.This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Carney.

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, September 17,2020A federal court in Texas sentenced ice cream manufacturer Blue Bell Creameries L.P. to pay $17.25 million in criminal penalties for shipments of contaminated products linked to a 2015 listeriosis outbreak, the Justice Department announced today.Blue Bell pleaded guilty in May 2020 to two misdemeanor counts of distributing adulterated ice cream products.  The sentence, imposed by U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman in Austin, Texas, was consistent with the terms of a plea agreement previously filed in the case.  The $17.25 million fine and forfeiture amount is the largest-ever criminal penalty following a conviction in a food safety case.“American consumers must be able to trust that the foods they purchase are safe to eat,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Bossert Clark of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.  “The sentence imposed today sends a clear message to food manufacturers that the Department of Justice will take appropriate actions when contaminated food products endanger consumers.”“The health of American consumers and the safety of our food are too important to be thwarted by the criminal acts of any individual or company,” said Judy McMeekin, Pharm.D., Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs, U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  “Americans expect and deserve the highest standards of food safety and integrity.  We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who put the public health at risk by distributing contaminated foods in the U.S. marketplace.”“The results of this investigation reflect the determination of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service to hold companies that sell food products to the military accountable and ensure they comply with food safety laws,” said Michael Mentavlos, Special Agent-in-Charge of the DCIS Southwest Field Office.  “The health and safety of our service members and their dependents is of paramount importance.”The plea agreement and criminal information filed against Blue Bell allege that the company distributed ice cream products that were manufactured under insanitary conditions and contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, in violation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.  According to the plea agreement, Texas state officials notified Blue Bell in February 2015 that samples of two ice cream products from the company’s Brenham, Texas factory tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes, a dangerous pathogen that can lead to serious illness or death in vulnerable populations such as pregnant women, newborns, the elderly, and those with compromised immune systems.  Blue Bell directed its delivery route drivers to remove remaining stock of the two products from store shelves, but the company did not recall the products or issue any formal communication to inform customers about the potential Listeria contamination.  Two weeks after receiving notification of the first positive Listeria tests, Texas state officials informed Blue Bell that additional state-led testing confirmed Listeria in a third product.  Blue Bell again chose not to issue any formal notification to customers regarding the positive tests. Blue Bell’s customers included military installations.In March 2015, tests conducted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) linked the strain of Listeria in one of the Blue Bell ice cream products to a strain that sickened five patients at a Kansas hospital with listeriosis, the severe illness caused by ingestion of Listeria-contaminated food.  The FDA, CDC, and Blue Bell all issued public recall notifications on March 13, 2015.  Subsequent tests confirmed Listeria contamination in a product made at another Blue Bell facility in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, which led to a second recall announcement on March 23, 2015.According to the plea agreement with the company, FDA inspections in March and April 2015 revealed sanitation issues at the Brenham and Broken Arrow facilities, including problems with the hot water supply needed to properly clean equipment and deteriorating factory conditions that could lead to insanitary water dripping into product mix during the manufacturing process.  Blue Bell temporarily closed all of its plants in late April 2015 to clean and update the facilities. Since re-opening its facilities in late 2015, Blue Bell has taken significant steps to enhance sanitation processes and enact a program to test products for Listeria prior to shipment.Trial Attorneys Patrick Hearn and Matt Lash of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch prosecuted the case with assistance from Shannon Singleton and Michael Varrone of the FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel.  The criminal investigation was conducted by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations and the Department of Defense Criminal Investigative Service.For more information about the enforcement efforts of the Consumer Protection Branch visit its website athttp://www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch.Topic(s):Consumer ProtectionComponent(s):Civil DivisionPress Release Number:20-955"

Moss of the District of Columbia to an Information filed in the District of Massachusetts charging one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution and bank fraud and one count of alteration and falsification of records. A sentencing date has not yet been scheduled.Dekermenjian admitted at the plea hearing that, from 2017 to 2018, while working as the General Counsel at a payment processing company based in Los Angeles, California (Company A), he conspired to fraudulently obtain payment processing services on behalf of a merchant providing student loan debt relief services. Company A had obtained payment card processing for the merchant from Fifth Third Bank beginning in 2016, but the bank’s risk department terminated the merchant in May 2017. Following the termination, executives at Company A counseled the merchant to re-apply for processing in the names of “sham merchants”. The sham merchants’ applications, backstopped by fake websites that purported to sell housewares, jewelry and leather goods, disguised the student loan debt relief company as a relatively low fraud and compliance risk. Dekermenjian learned of the scheme shortly after it commenced, joined the conspiracy, and subsequently earned commission payments of approximately $20,292 on the fraudulently obtained processing.The scheme was the subject of two separate federal investigations. In approximately November 2018, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Massachusetts issued a subpoena to Company A for records relating to processing for merchants involved in loans and debt collection and records relating to the creation of merchant websites. In approximately May 2019, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued a civil investigative demand to Company A seeking documents relating to the “sham merchants” that Company A used to obtain payment processing for the student loan debt relief merchant. Dekermenjian admitted in the plea hearing to falsifying and altering the sham merchant applications in June 2019 to conceal the existence of the scheme and his knowledge of it. Company A subsequently produced Dekermenjian’s falsified documents to the CFPB.United States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling of the District of Massachusetts and Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeEastern District of North CarolinaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, September 3,2020WASHINGTON – A North Carolina man pleaded guilty today before U.S. District Judge James C. Dever III in the Eastern District of North Carolina on charges that his company, Garland F. Fulcher Seafood Company Inc. (Garland Fulcher), at his direction, falsely labeled hundreds of thousands dollars’ worth of foreign crabmeat as “Product of USA.”According to information in the public record, Jeffrey A. Styron was the treasurer of the corporate board of officers for Garland Fulcher, a North Carolina company engaged in the business of purchasing, processing, packaging, transporting and selling seafood and seafood products, including crabmeat from domestically harvested blue crab.As treasurer, Styron was responsible for overseeing the daily operations of the company’s crab-related business, which involved managing and directing employees of the company with respect to the processing, packaging, and labeling of crab meat. Styron pleaded guilty to a one-count information charging him with substituting foreign crabmeat for domestic blue crab and, as part of the plea, Styron admitted to falsely labeling crabmeat with a retail market value of at least $250,000 dollars, which was sold primarily to small seafood retailers and restaurants.“Blue crabs are a classic American seafood product and a vital resource for coastal communities in North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and other parts of the United States,” said Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Bossert Clark for the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division. “This investigation is part of the department’s mission to work with our law enforcement partners in the protection of Atlantic blue crab populations and other marine resources.”“Seafood mislabeling is consumer fraud that undermines efforts of hardworking, honest fisherman and the free market by devaluing the price of domestic seafood,” said U.S. Attorney Robert J. Higdon Jr. for the Eastern District of North Carolina. “In this case, the fraudulent scheme artificially deflated the cost of domestic blue crab and gave Styron and Garland Fulcher Seafood an unacceptable and unfair economic advantage over law-abiding competitors.”“Seafood fraud undermines the economic viability of U.S. and global fisheries, deceives consumers, and threatens the health of those who consume tainted or misidentified seafood products,” said Chris Oliver, Assistant Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service. “This case is a great example of investigative cooperation by state and federal law enforcement to strengthen seafood fraud detection and safeguard the industry and consumers.”As part of his guilty plea, Styron admitted that he and his company could not and did not process sufficient quantities of domestic blue crab to meet customer demands. To make up the shortfall, Styron and his company used foreign crabmeat to fulfill customer orders. During the periods when the company did not have a sufficient supply of domestic crab, Styron and Garland Fulcher purchased crabmeat (not live crabs) from South America and Asia.As part of the guilty plea, Styron further admitted that beginning at least as early as Jan. 1, 2014, and continuing through Dec. 31, 2017, he directed company employees to repack foreign crabmeat into containers labeled “Product of USA,” which Garland Fulcher then sold to customers as “backfin,” “claw,” “lump,” “jumbo lump,” or “special,” domestically-harvested blue crab meat.Styron is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 7.This case was part of an ongoing effort by NOAA’s Office of Law Enforcement, in coordination with the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Justice to detect, deter and prosecute those engaged in the false labeling of crabmeat.This prosecution is being handled by the Environment and Natural Resources Division’s Environmental Crimes Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina.  Senior Litigation Counsel Banumathi Rangarajan and Trial Attorney Gary N.

DuCharme, Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and Jeffrey Ebersole, Special Agent-in-Charge, Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, New York Field Office (FDA-OCI), announced the arrest and charges.“As alleged, Settino abused his supervisory position at a pharmaceuticals company to steal large quantities of equine drugs in order to enrich himself and without regard for how his sale of the medical products could potentially endanger the health of horses,” stated Acting United States Attorney DuCharme.  “The defendant then allegedly compounded his criminal conduct by lying to an FDA Special Agent to minimize the scope of his thefts.  Thanks to the combined efforts of the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FDA, this illicit pipeline of stolen drugs to vets and horse trainers has been shut down.”“The safety and effectiveness of veterinary drugs play a key role in maintaining the health of animals.  When these drugs leave the legitimate supply chain, they can lose their effectiveness or become unsafe,” stated FDA-OCI Special Agent-in-Charge Ebersole.  “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who endanger the health of animals.”As set forth in court filings, Settino was the production supervisor of manufacturing at Luitpold Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in Shirley, New York.  In January 2019, Luitpold was renamed American Regent.  One of the products manufactured at Luitpold and American Regent was Adequan, an injectable equine drug administered to horses with degenerative joint disease and sold throughout the United States.  Between 2012 and January 2020, Settino allegedly stole thousands of bottles of Adequan from Luitpold and American Regent valued at over $1 million, and sold those drugs to horse trainers and veterinarians at New York racetracks, including Belmont Park, for more than $600,000.  Settino’s conduct endangered the health of horses because the drugs were not maintained, stored or transported in accordance with proper procedures for ensuring the safety, effectiveness and efficacy of the drugs.  At times, Settino transported the drugs in shoeboxes stored in his car.  At all times, the drugs were handled in violation of the FDA regulated supply chain.On January 23, 2020, Settino was interviewed by an FDA Special Agent and allegedly falsely stated that he had stolen fewer than 100 bottles of Adequan from Luitpold and American Regent.The charges in the indictment are allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.  If convicted, Settino faces up to 25 years in prison.The government’s case is being handled by the Office’s Long Island Criminal Division.  Assistant United States Attorney Charles P.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeWestern District of VirginiaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEMonday, August 31,2020ABINGDON, VIRGINIA – Timothy Baxter, the former global medical director of Indivior, pleaded guilty today in U.S. District Court in Abingdon to a one-count misdemeanor information charging him with causing the introduction into interstate commerce of the opioid drug Suboxone Film, which was misbranded in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  Indivior’s former chief executive officer, Shaun Thaxter, recently pleaded guilty to a similar charge.Baxter was the top medical executive of Indivior (formerly known as Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals) from 2000 until he left the company in May 2016.  Indivior and one of its subsidiaries have agreed to pay $600 million to resolve their criminal and civil liability, with the subsidiary pleading guilty to making false statements relating to health care matters.  Indivior’s former parent company, Reckitt Benckiser Group, previously paid $1.4 billion to resolve its liability.Suboxone Film is a drug approved for use by recovering opioid addicts to avoid or reduce withdrawal symptoms while they undergo drug-addiction treatment.  Suboxone and its active ingredient, buprenorphine, are powerful and addictive opioids.According to court documents, Baxter admitted that an Indivior employee he supervised sent inaccurate drug-safety information to the Massachusetts Medicaid agency, MassHealth, in 2012.  More specifically:• Baxter was familiar with the issue of unintended pediatric exposure – meaning children taking drugs by accident – and worked on it over several years.• In 2012, Indivior had a contractor collect data on unintended pediatric exposure to buprenorphine drugs, with Baxter approving the project.• In October 2012, an Indivior medical affairs manager who Baxter supervised met with MassHealth and urged it to expand its coverage of Suboxone Film.  In connection with the meeting, the medical affairs manager asked Indivior’s contractor for data on unintended pediatric exposure for data on Massachusetts.  The contractor sent the data to the medical affairs manager.  The data showed that other buprenorphine drugs – not Suboxone Film – had the lowest rate of unintended pediatric exposure in Massachusetts.  But the medical affairs manager changed the data to make it appear that Suboxone Film had the lowest rate of unintended pediatric exposure in Massachusetts, and emailed the altered, inaccurate data to MassHealth.  The medical affairs manager forwarded the email to Baxter, stating, “I hope this helps us get some movement” on expanding MassHealth coverage of Suboxone Film.• Then in November 2012, the medical affairs manager emailed MassHealth an incomplete graph that intentionally omitted more data on unintended pediatric exposure that was arguably unfavorable to Suboxone Film.  Baxter did not receive the email; but in another context, Baxter approved of using a similarly incomplete graph.• Then, the following quarter, the medical affairs manager received still more data showing that other buprenorphine drugs had lower rates of unintended pediatric exposure than Suboxone Film in Massachusetts. The medical affairs manager withheld the data from MassHealth, and later stated in a speech at an Indivior corporate conference that her rationale was “don’t ask, don’t tell.”• In December 2012, MassHealth announced that it would expand coverage of Suboxone Film for patients with children under the age of six.• With Baxter’s approval, Indivior sent a correction letter to MassHealth in December 2015.  By that time, the company had come under government investigation.“Pharmaceutical company executives have a responsibility to ensure that their products are truthfully marketed, especially when those products are addictive opioids,” said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Daniel J. Feith of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch.  “The Department of Justice will vigilantly protect public health by investigating and pursuing conduct associated with false and misleading drug claims.”“Health care providers and insurers rely on pharmaceutical manufacturers for honesty and accuracy when they provide information, which is particularly crucial when a company markets a powerful opioid,” First Assistant Daniel Bubar said today. “Timothy Baxter failed to ensure Indivior provided accurate information to a major insurance provider.  This is especially troubling, given Baxter’s long-time role as global medical director for the company.  I am again proud of the extensive efforts of the investigative team, which shows we will not tolerate companies or executives who break the law by placing profits over honesty.”“The opioid crisis has devastated families and communities across Virginia and around the country,” said Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring. “Opioid manufacturers and their executive leadership capitalized off of the opioid epidemic to sell more product, putting profits over safety. I am proud of the work my Medicaid Fraud Control Unit has done on these important cases and I want to thank our local, state and federal partners for their continued partnership.”“Opioid addiction and abuse is a serious public health crisis and addressing it is one the FDA’s highest priorities. Providing misleading information about drugs used to treat opioid addiction could ultimately exacerbate the problem by making these treatments more difficult to obtain,” said Catherine Hermsen, Assistant Commissioner of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations. “We will continue to work with the Department of Justice to investigate and hold accountable those who devise and participate in fraud schemes to the detriment of the public health.”“The multiple Indivior prosecutions illustrate the hard work and dedication of investigators who focused on the case,” said Elton Malone, Assistant Inspector General for Investigations with the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “This resolution is emblematic of law enforcement’s continued focus on this opioid epidemic, and serves as a warning to those who would flout the law.”“The Postal Service spends billions of dollars per year on health care related costs for its employees. It is the responsibility of special agents with the USPS OIG to ensure those dollars are paid to providers that follow the rules and regulations, and don’t try to cheat the government,” said U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General (USPS OIG) Special Agent in Charge Kenneth Cleevely, Eastern Area Field Office. “When we discover someone is trying to obtain money they are not entitled to, we will aggressively pursue them in coordination with our law enforcement partners, and seek their criminal prosecution when appropriate. This case should serve notice to other pharmaceutical providers that we are watching you, and we will find you if you try to cheat.”The case against Baxter is being prosecuted by attorneys from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia, Virginia Attorney General’s Office, and the Department of Justice Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch and Consumer Protection Branch, including Albert P. Mayer, Randy Ramseyer, Kristin L. Gray, Joseph S. Hall, Janine M. Myatt, Garth W. Huston, Carol Wallack, Jill P. Furman, Charles J. Biro, and Matthew J. Lash.  The investigation of Baxter was handled by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations; the Virginia Medicaid Fraud Control Unit; the United States Postal Service- Office of Inspector General; and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services - Office of Inspector General.  Assistance was provided by representatives of the FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel.Topic(s):OpioidsComponent(s):USAO - Virginia, Western"

Escalona and FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Miami Field Office Special Agent in Charge Justin C. Fielder.PATRICK CHARLES BISHOP, 54, is charged with conspiracy, fraudulently introducing adulterated drugs into interstate commerce, and fraudulently introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce.  Bishop is also charged with fraudulently obtaining pre-retail medical products, creating false documentation for those products, and knowingly possessing and trafficking in pre-retail medical products that he obtained by fraud.The charges in the indictment center on Bishop’s purchase, manufacture, labeling, marketing, sale, and distribution of drug products purportedly containing a peptide called PNC-27.  PNC-27 has not been approved by the FDA for use in the United States as a drug to treat any disease, including cancer.  Nor has PNC-27 undergone clinical trials in the United States on human beings to determine its efficacy, safety, or potential risks or side effects.“The public must have confidence that the products they are receiving are safe and properly labeled,” Escalona said.  “The U.S. Attorney’s Office will continue to investigate and prosecute those who jeopardize the health and safety of the public.”“The FDA’s requirements are designed to ensure that patients receive safe and effective medical treatments.  Evading the FDA process and distributing unapproved, adulterated, and misbranded drugs to vulnerable Americans will not be tolerated,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin C. Fielder, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Miami Field Office.  “Today’s announcement serves as a reminder of FDA’s continued focus on protecting the public health of the nation.”The indictment alleges that Bishop obtained the peptide from GL Biochem, a manufacturer based in China.  He paid the manufacturer more than $600,000 in 2015 and 2016 for peptide product he received.  According to the indictment, Bishop repeatedly assured that manufacturer that he would use the peptide solely for laboratory research purposes.  In fact, he and others used the peptide to make homemade suppositories in his kitchen in Birmingham, and at a warehouse he rented in Pelham.  The facilities were not sterile, and did not comply with current good manufacturing practices.  Customers who purchased suppositories from Bishop reported finding pieces of hair in their suppository packs.According to the indictment, Bishop and others marketed the PNC-27 drug products to alternative-medicine doctors, cancer patients, and others as an effective treatment for cancer.  Bishop sold PNC-27 drug products to Hope4Cancer, a holistic cancer treatment center with clinics in Mexico.  Bishop would ship the products to a location in California, and Hope4Cancer would use the products to treat patients at its Mexico clinics.  Bishop also sold PNC-27 drug products to patients and others in the United States, and shipped those products directly to locations in the United States and elsewhere.The indictment alleges that Bishop and others took steps to conceal these activities from the FDA and others.  Bishop used the business name Best Peptide Supply, LLC, to buy PNC-27 from GL Biochem, and he used the business name Immuno Cellular Restoration Program, Inc., to sell PNC-27 products to others.  He described his distribution of PNC-27 products as part of a research effort, and made false representations to FDA personnel and others to the same effect.The maximum punishment for conspiracy is five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.  The maximum punishment for the adulteration and misbranding charges is three years’ imprisonment for each count and a $250,000 fine.  The maximum punishment for each count of pre-retail medical product fraud is fifteen years’ imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.The FDA investigated the case, which Assistant U.S. Attorney J.B. Ward is prosecuting.An indictment is merely an allegation and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.Topic(s):Health Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - Alabama, Northern"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeNorthern District of TexasFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, August 20,2020A pharmacy marketer who allegedly collected more than $60 million in illegal kickbacks has been charged with violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, Northern District of Texas First Assistant U.S. Attorney Prerak Shah announced today.On Tuesday, a federal grand jury indicted Vinson Woodlee, owner of Med Left LLC, on one count of conspiracy to pay and receive healthcare kickbacks and three counts of soliciting and receiving healthcare kickbacks.According to the indictment, Mr. Woodlee, 68, served as a marketer for NextHealth, a pharmacy and laboratory services company controlled by Andrew Hillman and Semyon Narosov.NextHealth allegedly identified the industry’s most profitable prescriptions – including compound pain cream, scar cream, pain patches, and wellness supplements – then illegally paid physicians to prescribe those medications through NextHealth pharmacies, funneling some of the kickbacks through marketers like Mr. Woodlee.In exchange for enlisting physicians to participate in the scheme, Mr. Woodlee allegedly demanded roughly 50% of the profits from each prescription and refill written by the doctors he recruited. He then funneled a portion of the money on to prescribing physicians and sub-marketers, keeping the rest for himself.From 2012 to 2018, Mr. Woodlee allegedly collected more than $60 million in kickbacks. Of the $60 million, he passed $16.8 million on to “his” physicians and $30.6 million on to sub-marketers who likely passed a portion along to “their” physicians.  (Over that same period, NextHealth fraudulently billed insurers more than $700 million and received hundreds of millions of dollars in tainted proceeds.)Because NextHealth billed federal insurers like Medicare, TRICARE, CHAMPVA, and FECA in addition to private insurers, NextHealth and its marketers were subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS), which prohibits the knowing and willful payment of remuneration to induce or reward referrals for drugs or services payable by federal healthcare programs.  Knowing that some of the NextHealth kickbacks likely violated the AKS, Mr. Woodlee allegedly took a number of steps to conceal them:First, he attempted to exploit the AKS’s bona fide employee exception, which allows employers to pay W2 wages to legitimate employees.  From 2013 to 2014, under the auspice of an employment relationship, he and NextHealth disguised the kickbacks as his “salary” and “bonuses.”Later, he agreed that rather than disguising the kickbacks as his wages, NextHealth would disguise the payments as wages to three of his family members, Persons A, B, and C, who NextHealth “hired” as account executives in December 2014. On multiple occasions between 2014 and 2016, Mr. Woodlee corresponded with NextHealth about their compensation.Then, in spring 2016, Mr. Woodlee executed a new contract with NextHealth, increasing his commission on non-federal insurance prescriptions from 50 percent to 58 percent, effectively compensating himself for federal insurance prescriptions written in violation of the AKS.An indictment is merely an allegation of criminal conduct, not evidence. Like all defendants, Mr. Woodlee is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.If convicted, he faces up to 35 years in federal prison.In a separate case, NextHealth’s Andrew Hillman and Semyon Narasov pleaded guilty to money laundering conspiracy. According to court documents, the pair admitted NextHealth used marketers to funnel illegal kickbacks to physicians, attempted to conceal the payments, and submitted fraudulent claims to insurers. Mr. Hillman was sentenced to 66 months in federal prison; Mr. Narasov was sentenced to 76 months. The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Dallas Field Office, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, the U.S. Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, DOD’s Defense Criminal Investigative Service, IRS Criminal Investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Office of Inspector General, and HHS’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit conducted the investigation.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeWestern District of PennsylvaniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, August 20,2020PITTSBURGH – Three residents of New York, pleaded guilty in recent weeks in federal court to a charge of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud, United States Attorney Scott W. Brady announced today. The charges are in connection with a complex scheme related to the importation into the United States of prescription drugs from China, Russia and India, and the fraudulent credit card payment processing associated with those sales to consumers in the United States.Devan Abrams, age 39, of New York City, New York, Azad Khizgilov, age 46, of Staten Island, New York, and Roman Shaulov, age 53, of Brooklyn, New York, pleaded guilty to one count before Senior United States District Judge David S. Cercone. In related cases, Garri Shihman, age 49, of Parkland, Florida, and Gennady Nudelman, age 45, of Delray Beach, Florida, pled guilty and were sentenced in 2019.In connection with the various court proceedings, the court was advised that this complex matter has two primary components. The first is related to the illegal on-line sale of pharmaceutical drugs to U.S. consumers from a host of websites located primarily in India, China and Russia. The second component relates to the fraudulent processing of credit card payments for these pharmaceutical drugs and other products. The five defendants referred to in this press release are only directly associated with the second component. The fraudulent activity, which occurred between 2013 and 2017, involved the use of a series of misrepresentations that cause the credit card companies to process credit card transactions for illegally imported pharmaceutical drugs. The credit card companies have policies that preclude the use of their products and services to pay for illegally imported pharmaceutical drugs, and they have various internal controls designed to prevent the use of their products and services for such activities. In the scheme orchestrated by the defendants, they defrauded the credit card companies into processing tens of millions of dollars in payments for illegally imported pharmaceutical drugs through a series front companies, fake websites, fraudulent merchant applications, and other fraudulent activity.The fraud involved the establishment of hundreds of front companies that were established by these defendants any others, and fake web sites associated with those companies that falsely indicated that they were selling legitimate products. Together with the incorporation paperwork for the front companies and the fake website, the defendants submitted a merchant application to the credit card companies under the name of recruited accomplices. Once approved by the credit card companies, the defendants then arranged for the merchant accounts to process payments for the illegally imported pharmaceutical drugs.The defendants also arranged for a number of employees to serve on a telephone bank that received telephone calls from customers questioning charges on their credit card statements. That was necessary because the credit card statements reflected purchases from the front companies and not the internet companies selling the illegally imported pharmaceutical drugs. In this way, the telephone bank prevented the customers from reporting the fraud to the credit card companies.Federal agents began to undercover the fraud through controlled purchases from websites and search warrants at various locations. Abrams, Khizgilov, and Shihman operated out of offices located at 1812 Bath Avenue, Brooklyn, NY, and later, Abrams, Khizgilov and Shaulov operated out of offices located at 1706 Crospey Avenue, Brooklyn, NY. Search warrants executed at both of those locations led to evidence supporting the charges.Judge Cercone scheduled sentencing for Devan Abrams on December 15, 2020, for Azad Khizgilov on December 8, 2020, and for Roman Shaulov on December 17, 2020. The law provides for a total maximum sentence of not more than 30 years in prison, a fine of $1,000,000, or both for each defendant. Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the actual sentence imposed is based upon the seriousness of the offense and the prior criminal history, if any, of the defendant.Garri Shihman was sentenced in federal court to 45 months’ imprisonment on July 26, 2019. Gennady Nudelman was sentenced in federal court to 32 months’ imprisonment on May 8, 2019. Shihman and Nudelman are currently serving their sentences at a Bureau of Prisons facility.Assistant United States Attorney Brendan T. Conway is prosecuting this case on behalf of the government.The Food and Drug Administration – Office of Criminal Investigations, Homeland Security Investigations, Pennsylvania State Police and United States Postal Inspection Service conducted the investigation that led to the prosecutions of Abrams, Khizgilov, Shaulov, Shihman and Nudelman.Topic(s):Prescription DrugsFinancial FraudComponent(s):USAO - Pennsylvania, Western"

Christine, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia.In March 2020, during the midst of the global COVID-19 public health crisis, Ryncarz, through his company, Pharm Origins, created a website and began selling “Immune Shot” for $19 a bottle. Among other things, the website represented that “YOU will learn in JUST MINUTES … how to LOWER your risk of COVID-19 by nearly 50%.”  Further, to sell “Immune Shot,” Ryncarz and Pharm Origins targeted individuals, ages 50 and older, with heavy-handed sales pitches, such as “The NEXT FIVE MINUTES could save your life,” “We are offering you the exclusive price of only $19 per bottle because we know that Immune Shot could be the most important formula in the WORLD right now due to the new pandemic,” “Immune Shot is Not a Luxury, It is a Necessity Right Now,” “Point Blank, if YOU Leave, YOU are at Risk,” and “Is Your Life Worth $19? Seriously, Is It?”Ryncarz and Pharm Origins sold “Immune Shot” to consumers in the Southern District of Georgia and outside of the state of Georgia. The defendants were charged by way of an Information, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia. The Information alleges that “Immune Shot” was a misbranded drug within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. § 352(a)(1), in that it bore false and misleading labeling.“Our office is committed to ensuring that businesses do not take advantage of a global health crisis and people’s fears in order to unlawfully make a buck,” said U.S. Attorney Christine. “We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to make sure consumers are not exploited during these challenging times.”U.S. Attorney Christine expressed appreciation to David A.

The office had locations in Middleburg Heights, Ohio and Franklin and Smyrna, Tennessee. Defendant John Panuto was a licensed medical doctor and the Principal Investigator for the research company at the Middleburg Heights Office and was responsible for the oversight of most clinical trials conducted at that office.The defendants and their co-conspirators are alleged to have entered into agreements with these pharmaceutical companies, or sponsors, to conduct clinical trials of pharmaceutical drugs for public consumption. In order to perform these trials accurately, the research company was required to meet all applicable FDA regulations and other standards set by the sponsoring agencies.The defendants are alleged to have subverted these requirements by enrolling subjects in clinical trials under fictitious names, enrolling past subjects without their knowledge, and enrolling other subjects who did not meet pre-established criteria.  In addition, the defendants allegedly fabricated and falsified medical records, informed consent forms, and other documentation for fictitious study subjects.Court documents show that defendants were able to enrich themselves in this scheme by billing the sponsoring agencies for the time and participation of these fictitious subjects.As part of their scheme, the defendants are accused of circumnavigating the FDA’s oversight of clinical studies. In response to complaints from sponsoring agencies, the FDA conducted an investigation into the research company and found that Panuto had violated certain clinical trial criteria, such as failure to conduct studies in accordance with signed statements and failure to maintain adequate records.An indictment is only a charge and is not evidence of guilt.  A defendant is entitled to a fair trial in which it will be the government’s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.If convicted, the defendant's sentence will be determined by the Court after review of factors unique to this case, including the defendant's prior criminal record, if any, the defendant's role in the offense and the characteristics of the violation.In all cases, the sentence will not exceed the statutory maximum and in most cases it will be less than the maximum.The investigation preceding the indictment was conducted by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations.  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Megan R. Miller.Topic(s):Health Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - Ohio, NorthernContact:Daniel BallDaniel.Ball@usdoj.gov"

Pedersen has been indicted for posing as a medical doctor to sell a baseless treatment for coronavirus (COVID-19).  According to the indictment returned by a federal grand jury in Salt Lake City late last week, Pedersen fraudulently promoted and sold ingestible silver-based products as a cure for COVID-19 despite having no evidence that his products could treat or cure the disease.Pedersen is also alleged to have claimed to be a physician and worn a stethoscope and white lab coat in videos and photos posted on the Internet to further his alleged fraud scheme.In a related matter, the company Pedersen previously co-owned, My Doctor Suggests LLC (My Doctor Suggests), has agreed to plead guilty to a one-count criminal information related to its false and misleading marketing of ingestible silver products as a drug treatment for COVID-19.  The company has severed ties with Pedersen and agreed to cooperate in his prosecution.  The criminal information filed Thursday in the United States District Court for the District of Utah is part of a global resolution with My Doctor Suggests that also includes a civil consent order requiring the company to cease fraudulently labeling its products and to issue full refunds to affected consumers.“In addition to the imposition of a civil restraining order that successfully shut down fraudulent claims of a COVID-19 cure-all, Mr. Pedersen now faces criminal charges for his conduct. The federal felony allegations are serious, especially against the backdrop of this pandemic where Americans are yearning for effective relief. If proven, this conduct reveals a scheme where greed was a higher priority than conveying truth to consumers,” U.S. Attorney John W. Huber said.“The Department of Justice will take swift action to protect consumers from those who offer phony cure-alls for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Ethan Davis.  “We will continue to work closely with our partners at the Food and Drug Administration to quickly shut down schemes to promote and sell unlawful products during this pandemic.”The indictment against Pedersen alleges that, beginning in early 2020, he conducted a scheme to defraud consumers throughout the United States, by falsely presenting himself as a medical doctor and promoting and selling silver products on the Internet based on fraudulent claims of protection against, and treatment for, COVID-19, in the midst of a worldwide pandemic.According to the criminal information filed Friday, My Doctor Suggests made false and misleading claims that the company’s silver-based products could be ingested to protect against COVID-19 and the products lacked the necessary directions for use as a drug product.  The information also allege My Doctor Suggests operated without properly registering with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  It is anticipated My Doctor Suggests will plead guilty to a single misdemeanor count of distributing misbranded drug products in interstate commerce in violation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.“The FDA is actively monitoring the marketplace for fraudulent products represented as preventing, curing, or treating COVID-19. Americans expect and deserve treatments that are safe, effective and meet appropriate standards, and the agency will continue to bring to justice those who place profits above the public health during this pandemic,” said Judy McMeekin, Pharm.D., Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs, U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “Today’s announcement should serve as a reminder that we will take action against those who jeopardize the health of Americans while taking advantage of a crisis.”The Department of Justice previously sought and obtained an emergency court order in the United States District Court for the District of Utah, alleging in its civil complaint that My Doctor Suggests worked with two co-defendants, Pedersen and his company GP Silver LLC, to fraudulently promote and sell various silver products for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Subsequent orders temporarily enjoined Pedersen, GP Silver LLC, and My Doctor Suggests from distributing silver products as well as representing they could cure, mitigate, treat, or otherwise prevent COVID-19 or any other disease. The recent consent order permanently enjoins My Doctor Suggests LLC from making these representations, and it provides a notification and refund process for deceived consumers.The consent order specifically requires that My Doctor Suggests LLC permanently stop any fraudulent promotions, clearly and conspicuously disavow any statement that its silver products treat or prevent COVID-19 in future marketing materials and consumer notices, implement robust compliance measures to prevent a reoccurrence, and provide full refunds upon request to any customer who purchased its silver products under fraudulent pretenses. Affected customers can contact My Doctor Suggests LLC at (1-866- 660-9868) orrefunds@mydoctorsuggests.com.An indictment is an accusation by a federal grand jury and is not evidence of guilt.  The defendant should be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.The criminal action is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacob Strain from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Utah with assistance from Trial Attorney Matt Lash from the Department of Justice, Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch and James Smith from the FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel.  The criminal case was investigated by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations and the FBI’s Utah Field Office.The civil enforcement action was handled by Trial Attorneys Speare I.

        "content": "Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, July 24,2020Resolutions Follow CEO Guilty Plea and $1.4 Billion Settlement with Former Corporate ParentIndivior Solutions today pleaded guilty to a one-count felony information and, together with its parent companies Indivior Inc. and Indivior plc, agreed to pay a total of $600 million to resolve criminal and civil liability associated with the marketing of the opioid-addiction-treatment drug Suboxone.  Together with a $1.4 billion resolution with Indivior’s former parent, Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC (RB Group), announced in 2019, and a plea agreement with Indivior plc’s former CEO, Shaun Thaxter, announced last month, the total resolution relating to the marketing of Suboxone is more than $2 billion — the largest-ever resolution in a case brought by the Department of Justice involving an opioid drug.Suboxone is a drug product approved for use by recovering opioid addicts to avoid or reduce withdrawal symptoms while they undergo treatment for opioid-use disorder.  Suboxone contains buprenorphine, a powerful opioid.“Combatting the opioid crisis is a Department of Justice priority,” said Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Claire M. Murray.  “Today’s announced resolution and related actions hold accountable entities and individuals that unlawfully marketed opioid-addiction products.”“The opioid crisis is a public health emergency.  Prevention and access to effective treatments for opioid addiction are critical to fighting this epidemic,” said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Michael D. Granston for the Justice Department's Civil Division.  “When a drug manufacturer claims to be part of a solution for opioid addicts, we expect honesty and candor to government officials, as well as to the physicians and patients making important treatment decisions based on those representations.”Resolution of the Criminal InvestigationIndivior Solutions pleaded guilty today to a one-count felony criminal information charging false statements relating to health care matters.  In connection with its guilty plea, Indivior Solutions admitted to making false statements to promote the film version of Suboxone (Suboxone Film) to the Massachusetts Medicaid program (MassHealth) relating to the safety of Suboxone Film around children.  The resolution includes a criminal fine, forfeiture, and restitution totaling $289 million.  On June 30, 2020, Indivior plc’s former CEO Shaun Thaxter pleaded guilty to a one-count misdemeanor information related to Indivior’s false and misleading representations to MassHealth.In 2002, Indivior Inc. received approval to market Suboxone tablets for use in the treatment of opioid addiction and dependence.  At that time, Indivior Inc. was an RB Group subsidiary known as Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.  In December 2014, RB Group spun off Indivior Inc., and the two companies are no longer affiliated.  Thereafter, Indivior Inc. became a subsidiary of Indivior plc.  On April 9, 2019, a federal grand jury sitting in Abingdon, Virginia, indicted Indivior Inc. and Indivior plc for allegedly engaging in an illicit nationwide scheme to increase prescriptions of Suboxone.In its guilty plea today, Indivior Solutions, which employed marketing and sales personnel for the Indivior group of companies, admitted to an aspect of the scheme alleged in the indictment.  Specifically, Indivior Solutions admitted that, in October 2012, it sought to convince MassHealth to expand Medicaid coverage of Suboxone Film in Massachusetts and sent MassHealth false data indicating that Suboxone Film had the lowest rate of accidental pediatric exposure (i.e., children taking medication by accident) of all buprenorphine drugs in Massachusetts, when in fact, it did not.  Indivior Solutions further admitted that sending the false and misleading information occurred in the context of marketing and promotional efforts directed at MassHealth, which were overseen by top executives.  MassHealth announced it would provide access to Suboxone Film for patients with children under the age of six shortly after Indivior provided the false and misleading information to agency officials.“During the nationwide opioid epidemic, Indivior Solutions made false statements about Suboxone’s safety to increase its sales.  In doing so, Indivior Solutions misled government health care officials and is being held accountable today for its felonious conduct,” said First Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel P. Bubar of the Western District of Virginia.  “This resolution is the culmination of years of work by prosecutors and agents and demonstrates that we will continue to work tirelessly to hold pharmaceutical manufacturers responsible for illegal conduct.”In addition to its financial aspects, the agreement with Indivior Inc. includes novel provisions that:Require Indivior Inc. to disband its Suboxone sales force and not reinstate it;Require Indivior Inc.’s CEO to personally certify, under penalty of perjury, on an annual basis that during the prior year (a) Indivior was in compliance with the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act and did not commit health care fraud or (b) list all non-compliant activity and the steps taken by Indivior to remedy these acts;Prohibit Indivior Inc. from using data obtained from surveys of health care providers for marketing, sales, and promotional purposes;Require Indivior Inc. to remove health care providers from their promotional programs who are at a high risk of inappropriate prescribing; andMake Indivior subject to contempt sanctions by the court and reinstatement of the dismissed charges if it violates the agreement.“The opioid crisis has devastated families and communities across the Commonwealth and drug manufacturers must be held accountable for their role in creating and prolonging this crisis,” said Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring.  “I want to thank my Medicaid Fraud Control Unit for their work on this important case, as well as our local, state and federal partners for their continued collaboration.  My team and I will continue to do everything in our power to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for their role in the opioid crisis and help to ensure justice for those families who have been effected by the opioid crisis.”“Parties that contract with the government will be held to the letter of the contract,” said Kenneth Cleevely, Special Agent in Charge of the Eastern Field Office for the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General.  “The U.S. Postal Service spends billions of dollars per year in workers compensation-related costs, most of which are legitimate.  However, when medical providers or companies choose to flout the rules and profit illegally, special agents with the USPS OIG will work with our law enforcement partners to hold them responsible.  To report fraud or other criminal activity involving the Postal Service, contact USPS OIG special agents atwww.uspsoig.govor 888-USPS-OIG.”U.S. District Judge James P. Jones accepted the guilty plea but deferred acceptance of the plea agreement until after the preparation of a presentence report.  He scheduled sentencing for Oct. 20, 2020 at the U.S. Courthouse in Abingdon, Virginia.The Civil SettlementUnder the civil settlement, Indivior Inc. and Indivior plc have agreed to pay a total of $300 million to resolve claims that the marketing of Suboxone caused false claims to be submitted to government health care programs.The $300 million settlement amount includes approximately $209.3 million to the federal government and $90.7 million to states that opt to participate in the agreement.The civil settlement resolves allegations by the United States that, from 2010 through 2015, Indivior companies knowingly (a) promoted the sale and use of Suboxone to physicians who were writing prescriptions that were not for a medically accepted indication and that lacked a legitimate medical purpose, were issued without any counseling or psychosocial support, were for uses that were unsafe, ineffective, and medically unnecessary, and were often diverted; (b) promoted the sale or use of Suboxone Film to physicians and state Medicaid agencies using false and misleading claims that Suboxone Film was less susceptible to diversion and abuse than other buprenorphine products and that Suboxone Film was less susceptible to accidental pediatric exposure than tablets; and (c) submitted a petition to the Food and Drug Administration on Sept. 25, 2012, claiming that Suboxone Tablet had been discontinued “due to safety concerns” about the tablet formulation of the drug and took other steps to delay the entry of generic competition for Suboxone to improperly control pricing of Suboxone, including pricing to federal healthcare programs.“Prescription opioids are both addictive and dangerous when diverted for improper use or prescribed without accurate information about the risks that they pose,” said U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito for the District of New Jersey.  “This resolution holds Indivior to account for placing profit above patient and community safety.”The civil settlement resolves claims against Indivior in six lawsuits pending in federal court in the Western District of Virginia and the District of New Jersey under the qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions of the False Claims Act, which allow private citizens to bring civil actions on behalf of the United States and share in any recovery.  The False Claims Act also permits the government to intervene in such actions, as the government previously did in the three lawsuits pending in the Western District of Virginia.  The whistleblower share to be awarded in this case has not yet been determined.“Opioid addiction and abuse is an immense public health crisis and taking steps to address it is one of the FDA’s highest priorities,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D.  “Medication-assisted treatments incorporating drugs like Indivior’s Suboxone, in combination with counseling and behavioral therapy, are an important tool in combating opioid use disorder but can quickly become part of the problem if not used responsibly.  When companies encourage the use of powerful drugs where not medically necessary and provide misleading information about relative product benefits, they can ultimately risk more misuse, abuse, diversion, and accidental exposure to opioid drugs as well as make treatment more difficult to obtain for those suffering from this crisis.  We will continue to work with the Department of Justice to investigate and hold accountable those who devise and participate in schemes to the detriment of the public health.”Non-monetary Provisions of the Corporate Integrity AgreementIn addition to the criminal and civil resolutions, Indivior executed a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG).  The CIA requires that Indivior implement numerous accountability and auditing provisions.  On an annual basis, top executives and the Board of Directors must certify about compliance, Indivior must conduct annual risk assessments and other monitoring, and an independent review organization will conduct multi-faceted audits.“Addressing the opioid crisis is a top priority for OIG, and we will continue to work closely with the Department of Justice to hold corporations and individuals accountable when they use illegal tactics to promote and sell opioids,” said Gregory E. Demske, Chief Counsel to the Inspector General, HHS-OIG.  “Among other things, our CIA with Indivior imposes accountability on the Board and top executives, subjects the company to internal and external auditing, and ensures that the company will separate itself from its prior top leadership.”“The opioid epidemic has ravaged this nation,” said Elton Malone, Assistant Inspector General for Investigations with the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  “This resolution, along with our law enforcement partners’ work, should serve as a warning that large companies will face prosecution if they break the law.”FTC ResolutionUnder a separate agreement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Indivior has agreed to pay $10 million to resolve claims that it engaged in unfair methods of competition in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. § 53(b).  The FTC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia alleging anticompetitive activities by Indivior designed to impede competition from generic equivalents of Suboxone.  As part of a consent decree, Indivior agreed that it would notify the FTC if it filed a Citizen Petition with the FDA in connection with a drug product, it would simultaneously disclose to both the FDA and the FTC all studies and data relevant to that Citizen Petition.  Indivior further agreed not to withdraw a drug from the market or otherwise disadvantage a drug after obtaining approval to market another drug containing the same active ingredient.“As alleged in the FTC’s complaint, in the midst of the nation’s opioid crisis, a critical opioid-addiction treatment was about to become more affordable,” said Gail Levine, a Deputy Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition.  “But Indivior prevented that.  It kept its drug prices high by unlawfully impeding generic manufacturers from competing effectively.”A Multilateral EffortThe criminal case against Indivior was prosecuted by Randy Ramseyer of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia, Albert P. Mayer and Carol Wallack of the Department of Justice Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch, Charles J. Biro and Matthew J. Lash of the Department of Justice Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch, Kristin L. Gray, Joseph S. Hall and Janine M. Myatt of the Virginia Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the Office of the Virginia Attorney General, and Garth W. Huston of the Federal Trade Commission.  This matter was investigated by the Virginia Attorney General’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit; FDA - Office of Criminal Investigation; United States Postal Service – Office of Inspector General; and Department of Health and Human Services - Office of Inspector General.The civil settlement was handled by Edward Crooke of the Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch, Sara Bugbee Winn of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia, and Andrew A. Caffrey III of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey.  Assistance was provided by representatives of the HHS Office of Counsel to the Inspector General; the HHS Office of the General Counsel, CMS Division; FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel; the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia; the U.S. Department of Agriculture Office of the General Counsel; the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units; the Defense Criminal Investigative Service; the Office of Personnel Management - Office of Inspector General; the Department of Veterans’ Affairs Office of Inspector General; the Department of Labor - Office of Inspector General; and TRICARE Program Integrity.The joint effort advances the goals of the Department’s Prescription Interdiction & Litigation (PIL) Task Force to deploy all available criminal, civil, and regulatory tools to hold opioid manufacturers accountable for unlawful practices and to ensure that prescription opioid products are marketed truthfully.Except to the extent admitted as part of the criminal resolution, the claims resolved by the civil settlement are allegations only.  There has been no determination of liability in the civil case.For more information about the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia, visit its website athttps://www.justice.gov/usao-wdva.  Additional information about the Consumer Protection Branch and the Civil Fraud Section and their enforcement efforts may be found athttp://www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branchandhttp://www. justice.gov/civil/fraud-section.  Tips and complaints from all sources about potential fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, can be reported to the Department of Health and Human Services at 800-HHS-TIPS (800-447-8477).Topic(s):Consumer ProtectionOpioidsComponent(s):Civil DivisionUSAO - New JerseyUSAO - Virginia, WesternPress Release Number:20-697"

        "content": "Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, July 17,2020Two citizens of Ukraine have admitted they conspired to smuggle and distribute counterfeit cancer and hepatitis drugs into the United States, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt and U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick of the Southern District of Texas.Maksym Nienadov, 36, is the owner of the Ukrainian-based company Healthy Nation. He and his co-conspirator and employee – Volodymyr Nikolaienko, 33 – pleaded guilty today to conspiracy, trafficking in counterfeit drugs and smuggling goods into the United States. Nienadov also admitted to introducing misbranded drugs into the United States.In June 2018, undercover U.S. authorities began communicating with Nienadov about the illegal sale of Keytruda. This prompted a months-long exchange which also involved Nikolaienko and resulted in the unlawful sale of counterfeit or unapproved Keytruda, Abraxane and Epclusa. Neither Nienadov nor Nikolaienko are medical doctors, pharmacists or licensed pharmaceutical wholesalers in the United States and did not have authorization to sell the drugs.Merck & Co. manufactures Keytruda, a medicine to treat cancer, while Gilead Sciences Inc. manufactures Epclusa, a prescription drug for the treatment of hepatitis-C. Celgene Corporation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol Myers Squibb and manufactures the oncology product Abraxane. In their legitimate form, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved all three drugs for distribution in the United States.During the undercover investigation, law enforcement received Nienadov’s banking information, which included the name “Maksim Nenadov” and his Ukrainian bank account number. Authorities transferred $2,400 to his bank account for the purchase of the purported Keytruda. Soon after, they received a shipment from “Maxim Nenadov” which contained two boxes represented to contain Keytruda. However, the items were sent to Merck for testing and determined to be counterfeit.Authorities then negotiated the purchase of more Keytruda as well as another medication, Abraxane. The online messaging and email conversations resulted in a $3,400 undercover payment to Nienadov for the purchase of both drugs. On July 30, 2018, “Maxim Nenadov” sent two boxes of 50 mg purported Keytruda and two boxes of supposed Abraxane 5 mg/ml to undercover agents. Merck and Celgene performed analyses and confirmed the packaging and medication to be counterfeit.In late 2018, law enforcement also negotiated the undercover purchase of two boxes of purported Epclusa tablets from Nienadov and Nikolaienko for $6,000. Gilead identified the packaging and contents as counterfeit.Nienadov and Nikolaienko were taken into custody April 18, 2019, after they arrived in the United States from Ukraine to discuss future unlawful shipments of pharmaceuticals.U.S. Magistrate Judge Christina A. Bryan took the pleas today. Sentencing has been set for Nov. 4, 2020 before Chief Judge Rosenthal. Both men will remain in custody pending that hearing.Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations and FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations conducted the investigation.Senior Trial Attorney Jeffrey Pearlman of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Sebastian Edwards of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case.  Former CCIPS Senior Trial Attorney Kebharu Smith assisted in the prosecution.  In addition, the Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs and the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine provided substantial assistance.The year 2020 marks the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice.  Learn more about the history of our agency atwww.Justice.gov/Celebrating150Years.Topic(s):Prescription DrugsHealth Care FraudComponent(s):Criminal - Computer Crime and Intellectual Property SectionPress Release Number:20-670"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeEastern District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASETuesday, July 14,2020FRESNO, Calif. — A Porterville man was arrested today after a federal grand jury returned a five count indictment on July 9, charging him with mail fraud and introducing a misbranded drug into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud, U.S. Attorney McGregor W. Scott announced.According to the indictment, Huu Tieu, 58, I, s the president and chief executive officer of Golden Sunrise Pharmaceutical Inc. and Golden Sunrise Nutraceutical Inc., both headquartered in Porterville. From at least April 25 to July 9, through his companies, Tieu marketed and sold a package of herbal mixtures dubbed the “Emergency D-Virus Plan of Care,” which he claimed treated COVID-19. In materials posted on the companies’ websites and Facebook pages and in emails to the media, Tieu made a series of false statements about the Emergency D-Virus Plan of Care, including:That one of the mixtures in the product, called “ImunStem,” was the first dietary supplement in the United States to be FDA approved as a prescription medicine to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and had specifically been approved to treat COVID 19. In reality, the FDA has never approved any Golden Sunrise product for any intended use and, on at least two occasions, has told Tieu in writing that ImunStem is not FDA approved; andThat ImunStem was designated as a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) under the 21st Century Cures Act. In reality, the FDA never granted an RMAT designation to any Golden Sunrise product, denied Tieu’s request for an RMAT designation for ImunStem in 2017, and reiterated that denial to Tieu in writing in 2019.According to the indictment, Tieu made these misrepresentations for the purpose of soliciting customers, both patients and health care professionals, to acquire Golden Sunrise products so that he could submit reimbursement claims to the patients’ insurers, including Medicare and Medi-Cal. Tieu dispensed his products to customers in the Porterville area and also shipped the products to other parts of California and the United States.On May 8, an undercover investigator with the Tulare County District Attorney’s Office met with Tieu in person, telling him her mother was 68 and very sick with COVID-19. The investigator asked Tieu if she should take her mother to the hospital. Tieu responded, “No. You cannot go in there,” and instead, encouraged her to use Golden Sunrise products.“The FDA is actively monitoring the marketplace for fraudulent products claiming to treat COVID-19. Americans expect and deserve treatments that are safe, effective and meet appropriate standards, and the agency will continue to bring to justice those who place profits above the public health during this pandemic,” said Special Agent in Charge Lisa L. Malinowski, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office. “We commend the efforts of our law enforcement partners in this investigation and today’s announcement should serve as a reminder that we will take appropriate action against those who jeopardize the health of Americans while taking advantage of a crisis.”This case is the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the California Department of Health Care Services with assistance from the Tulare County District Attorney’s Office and the California Bureau of Medi-Cal Fraud and Elder Abuse. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Vincente Tennerelli and Alexandre Dempsey are prosecuting the case.If convicted, Tieu faces a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine on the mail fraud counts and three years in prison and a $10,000 fine on the misbranding counts. Any sentence, however, would be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables. The charges are only allegations; the defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.Attachment(s):Download tieu_indictment2.pdfTopic(s):CoronavirusConsumer ProtectionHealth Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - California, EasternPress Release Number:1:20-cr-109 DAD"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeEastern District of VirginiaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, July 10,2020ALEXANDRIA, Va. – A Maryland Darknet vendor and a Nebraska pharmacist pleaded guilty today to charges related to a conspiracy to use explosives to firebomb and destroy a competitor pharmacy.According to court documents, from August 2019 through April 2020, Hyrum T. Wilson, 41, of Auburn, Nebraska, illegally mailed over 19,000 dosage units of prescription medications, including opioids, from his pharmacy in Nebraska to the Maryland residence of co-conspirator William Anderson Burgamy IV, 32, of Hanover. Burgamy illegally sold prescription drugs through his Darknet vendor account to customers nationwide, including here in the Eastern District of Virginia, and claimed at one point that he made nearly $1 million total. Burgamy and Wilson laundered the proceeds of their scheme using Bitcoin cryptocurrency payments, wire transfers, and bundles of cash sent through the mail.“Burgamy and Wilson carefully plotted a violent attack operation involving explosives, firearms, the Darknet, prescription opioid trafficking, cryptocurrency, and sophisticated money laundering,” said G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. “Those potentially deadly plans were successfully thwarted during the early stages of the pandemic. This case highlights elements of EDVA’s national security, narcotics, cyber, financial, and violent crime work, all of which can only be performed with the tenacity and skilled investigative efforts demonstrated by our law enforcement partners.”Given the profitability of the Darknet scheme, Wilson repeatedly hit limits, set by his distributor, on the amount of prescription drugs that he could obtain and provide to Burgamy. Consequently, Burgamy and Wilson developed an attack plot known as “Operation Firewood” to break into, steal the opiate supply of, and firebomb a competing pharmacy located in Auburn by using explosives. The goal of the attack plot was to destroy Wilson’s local competition, which Burgamy and Wilson believed would increase the volume of prescription drugs that Wilson’s pharmacy could obtain, thereby allowing Burgamy and Wilson’s drug trafficking operation to continue and expand.“This investigation, conducted by the Hi-Tech Opioid Task Force and our partners, demonstrates the dedication and expertise of law enforcement to disrupt and dismantle violent attacks and illegal drug trafficking,” said James A. Dawson, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Washington Field Office's Criminal Division. “Burgamy and Wilson put thousands of illegal opioids in the hands of people across the country and their brazen and violent plot could have had deadly consequences. The selling of illicit drugs on the Darknet will not be tolerated. No matter where these criminals try to hide, the FBI will work to bring them to justice and protect our communities.”According to court documents, Burgamy told Wilson that he would never surrender to law enforcement, that if anyone showed up during the attack, he would “blast [his] [expletive] way out,” and that he would shoot bullets at anyone who attempted to confront or apprehend him, including the owner of the victim pharmacy. Prior to Burgamy’s arrest in April 2020, which uncovered and thwarted the firebombing plot, Burgamy and Wilson fully intended on the attack occurring after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted.“The opioid epidemic that has resulted in overdoses and deaths is a national public health crisis,” said Mark S. McCormack, Special Agent in Charge of the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Metro Washington Field Office. “Criminals who contribute to that crisis through their illegal actions such as illicit opioid distribution, whether online, on the Darknet, or through conventional drug distribution methods, will be brought to justice. The FDA is fully committed to dismantling illegal prescription drug distribution networks that misuse the internet at the expense of public health and safety.”Wilson created a “getaway” map and escape routes for Burgamy to use to help him evade law enforcement detection after the firebombing. Wilson instructed Burgamy to make the firebombing appear as though it was committed by a fictitious “pissed off husband” who learned about a fabricated affair involving the husband’s wife and a pharmacist from the victim pharmacy.Burgamy assured Wilson that if anything happened to him, he would take care of Wilson’s “family and bills,” and Wilson agreed to safeguard Burgamy’s life insurance information in the event Burgamy was killed during the attack. Burgamy and Wilson also agreed that Burgamy and another individual would carry multiple firearms during the attack and use explosives, specifically Molotov cocktails enhanced with Styrofoam as a thickening agent, to burn the victim pharmacy down. Law enforcement located eight unsecured fully loaded firearms in Burgamy’s residence, including AR-15 assault rifles and numerous high capacity magazines.Burgamy and Wilson each pleaded guilty to conspiracy to use explosives, conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, and money laundering. Burgamy, who also pleaded guilty to a firearms offense, and Wilson both face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on each count when sentenced on November 20. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.G.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeWestern District of WisconsinFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, July 10,2020MADISON, WIS. – Scott C. Blader, United States Attorney for the Western District of Wisconsin, announced that Ursula Wing, 42, New York City, New York, was sentenced today by Chief U.S. District Judge James D. Peterson to a two-year term of probation, and fined $10,000, for supplying abortion-inducing pills without a prescription to customers in the United States, including Wisconsin, and throughout the world, and concealing her conduct from U.S. government regulatory and enforcement authorities.On March 20, 2020, Wing pleaded guilty to Count 1 of an indictment that charged her with conspiracy to defraud various U.S. governmental agencies, including the FDA, U.S. Postal Service, and U.S. Customs.  The indictment alleged that Wing operated a blog called “the Macrobiotic Stoner,” with a secret web page called “My Secret Bodega,” where she sold foreign-sourced versions of Mifepristone and Misoprostol from India, that were not approved by the FDA for use in the United States.According to the indictment, these drugs are used to medically terminate an early pregnancy (up to 70 days or less).  Mifepristone is a prescription drug, but is not available to the public through pharmacies; its distribution is restricted to specially qualified, licensed physicians, and the administration of Mifepristone is subject to an FDA Risk and Evaluation Mitigation Strategy (REMS).  Among the REMS requirements are that Mifepristone may only be dispensed in clinics, medical offices, and hospitals by, or under the supervision of, a certified healthcare provider.At her plea hearing, Wing admitted that she could not sell these prescription drugs because she was not licensed to do so. She also admitted that she illegally smuggled these misbranded drugs into the United States from an offshore pharmacy located in India.  Wing admitted that she operated a fake jewelry business called Fatima’s Bead Basket to hide her illegal conduct from U.S. authorities.  Wing admitted that she inserted a necklace or other item of jewelry into the shipping envelope to serve as the cover piece of merchandise being mailed to the customer.  She then packaged the misbranded prescription drugs into a smaller packet that was in a hidden panel and taped to the inside of the shipping envelope.  Wing also disguised the nature of the item being purchased by listing jewelry product names on the invoice.Wing also admitted that she created a second fake online jewelry business called Morocco International and a fake merchant processing portal for use as a cover for selling the misbranded prescription drugs on her secret webpage.  By creating this fake merchant processing portal, Wing allowed her Macrobiotic Stoner clients to pay for the misbranded drugs using their credit cards, with the sales showing up on the merchant account as jewelry, and not Mifepristone or Misoprostol.At today’s sentencing, Judge Peterson noted that while Wing had the right to disagree with the legal requirements surrounding the distribution of Mifepristone and Misoprostol in the United States, she nonetheless committed a crime in selling these drugs, which she knowingly obtained from an offshore pharmacy in India, and which had not been approved by the FDA for use in the United States.  Judge Peterson explained that such conduct created a danger to the public in two ways.  First, it allowed people to obtain the drugs such as a Marathon County man who allegedly used them in an attempt to induce his girlfriend to abort her 120-day pregnancy without her knowledge or consent, which resulted in the man being charged in Marathon County Circuit Court with attempted first-degree intentional homicide of an unborn child.  Second, Wing could not vouch for the safety of the product she was distributing, as evidenced by the fact that she had no testing protocols in place, and had to trust the pills she was smuggling into the United States from India were safe and effective.Judge Peterson also ordered Wing to forfeit $61,753, which represented the cost of the Mifepristone and Misoprostol pills that Wing sold from 2016 to 2018.“Prescription drugs that are obtained illegally from online sources and then sold online to consumers can cause serious harm,” said Special Agent in Charge Lynda M. Burdelik, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Chicago Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring justice to those who place the public’s health at risk.”The case against Wing is the result of an investigation conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration - Office of Criminal Investigations, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations.  The prosecution of this case is being handled by Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Graber.Component(s):USAO - Wisconsin, Western"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of FloridaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, July 8, 2020Defendants Allegedly Attempted to Avoid Government Regulation by Selling Products Through a Company They Deceptively Named Genesis II ChurchMiami, Fl. – Federal prosecutors in Miami have charged four Florida residents who allegedly marketed “Miracle Mineral Solution,” a toxic bleach, as a cure for COVID-19, with conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to violate the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and criminal contempt.Ariana Fajardo Orshan, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and Catherine Hermsen, Assistant Commissioner of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, made the announcement.According to the criminal complaint affidavit,Mark Grenon, 62, and his sons,Jonathan Grenon, 34,Jordan Grenon, 26, andJoseph Grenon, 32, all of Bradenton, Florida, manufacture, promote, and sell Miracle Mineral Solution (“MMS”), a chemical solution containing sodium chlorite and water. The Grenons allegedly directed their customers to ingest MMS orally, which causes the solution to become chlorine dioxide, a powerful bleach, typically used for industrial water treatment or bleaching textiles, pulp, and paper.  FDA has received reports of people requiring hospitalizations, developing life-threatening conditions, and dying after drinking MMS.According to the affidavit, the Grenons claim that MMS can treat, prevent, and cure COVID-19.  The FDA, however, has not approved MMS for treatment of COVID-19, or for any other use.  Rather, in prior official warning statements, the FDA has strongly urged consumers not to purchase or use MMS, explaining that drinking MMS is the same as drinking bleach and can cause dangerous side effects, including severe vomiting, diarrhea, and life-threatening low blood pressure. Seehttps://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/danger-dont-drink-miracle-mineral-solution-or-similar-products.The affidavit also alleges that, before marketing MMS as a cure for COVID-19, the Grenons marketed MMS as a miracle cure-all for dozens of other serious diseases and disorders, including cancer, Alzheimer’s, autism, multiple sclerosis, and HIV/AIDS, even though the FDA had not approved MMS for any use. The Grenons allegedly sold tens of thousands of bottles of MMS nationwide, including to consumers throughout South Florida. They sold this dangerous product under the guise of Genesis II Church of Health and Healing (“Genesis”), an entity they allegedly created in an attempt to avoid government regulation of MMS. According to the charging documents, Genesis’ own websites describe Genesis as a “non-religious church,” and Defendant Mark Grenon, the co-founder of Genesis, has repeatedly acknowledged that Genesis “has nothing to do with religion,” and that he founded Genesis to “legalize the use of MMS” and avoid “going [ ] to jail.”In addition to charging these defendants with federal conspiracy, the complaint also charges the Grenons with criminal contempt. The United States previously filed a civil case against the defendants and Genesis II Church of Health and Healing. See United States v. Genesis II Church of Health and Healing, et al., Case No. 20-21601-CV-WILLIAMS. In that civil case, the United States obtained court orders halting the Grenons’ distribution of MMS. The criminal charges against the Grenons allege that they willfully violated these court orders. According to the complaint affidavit, the Grenons sent letters to the judge presiding over the civil case saying that they would not comply with the Court’s orders. The Grenons also threatened violence in the letters. The criminal complaint affidavit quotes from these letters.“We continue to protect the public from criminal conduct that takes advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Ariana Fajardo Orshan, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. “Not only is this MMS product toxic, but its distribution and use may prevent those who are sick from receiving the legitimate healthcare they need. A United States District Court already has ordered the defendants to stop distributing this product; we will not sit idly by as individuals purposefully violate Court orders and put the public in danger.”“Making claims that unproven drugs, especially potentially dangerous and unapproved chlorine dioxide products, can cure or prevent COVID-19 or any other disease is unacceptable. The Genesis II Church of Health and Healing has actively and deliberately placed consumers at risk with their fraudulent Miracle Mineral Solution and Americans expect and deserve medical treatments that have been scientifically proven to be safe and effective,” said Catherine Hermsen, Assistant Commissioner of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations. “We commend the efforts of our law enforcement partners for vigorously investigating this matter. The FDA will continue our efforts to make sure these and other like-minded sellers do not jeopardize the health of Americans during this pandemic and in the future.”U.S. Attorney Fajardo Orshan commended the efforts of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, particularly its Miami Field Office. Assistant United States Attorneys Michael B. Homer and John Shipley are prosecuting this case.A criminal complaint is a charging instrument containing allegations.  A defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.Related court documents and information may be found on the website of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida atwww.flsd.uscourts.govor athttp://pacer.flsd.uscourts.gov, under case number 20-MJ-03050.Topic(s):CoronavirusComponent(s):USAO - Florida, Southern"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeWestern District of MichiganFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEMonday, June 29, 2020Office Manager Mark J. Sabor Sentenced Today for Conspiracy to Commit Healthcare Fraud and Agrees to Pay Share of Civil Settlement Totaling $1.26 MillionGRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN— U.S. Attorney Andrew B. Birge announced today that U.S. District Judge Janet T. Neff sentenced Mark J. Sabor to two years of incarceration for his involvement in a conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud. Mr. Sabor was the manager of Urological Solutions of Michigan (\"USM\"), a mobile medical practice providing urological services to patients in their homes and assisted living facilities in the greater Traverse City, Grand Rapids, and Kalamazoo areas.Judge Neff found that Mr. Sabor was complicit in several fraud schemes committed by USM, resulting in approximately $914,000 in false claims submitted by USM and paid by Medicare. These schemes included billing pelvic muscle rehabilitation (\"PMR) therapy using improper—and more lucrative—diagnostic codes, billing for evaluation and management (\"E&M\") services that did not occur, upcoding ultrasound services, and billing for the services of an unlicensed nurse assistant. Judge Neff applied an enhancement to Mr. Sabor’s sentencing guidelines based on the fact that an administrative law judge in 2011 ruled that USM should not bill Medicare for the PMR therapy using the diagnostic codes. In imposing the prison sentence, Judge Neff emphasized the need to deter other healthcare practitioners and practice managers from cheating important government programs and to promote respect for the law.Mr. Sabor’s conviction was part of a larger investigation of USM’s owner, Roger D. Beyer, M.D., and his wife, Susan E. Wright, N.P., J.D. Dr. Beyer was the owner of USM and Women’s Health Care Specialists, P.C. (\"WHCS\"), an obstetrics-gynecology practice in Kalamazoo. Ms. Wright was an employee of WHCS.On May 15, 2020, Dr. Beyer pleaded guilty in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan to conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud and adulteration of a medical device. That same day, Ms. Wright pleaded guilty to misprision of healthcare fraud and the adulteration of a medical device. Specifically, Ms. Wright admitted that she knew that USM fraudulently billed Medicare for E&M services to patients on the same date of service as the PMR therapy, but she never informed authorities. Both Dr. Beyer and Ms. Wright are scheduled to be sentenced before Judge Neff on September 9, 2020.In addition to their convictions, all defendants entered into civil settlements with the United States to resolve their civil liability under the False Claims Act. In total, the defendants, including the now-closed USM and WHCS practices, paid $1,260,000 for submitting or causing the submission of false claims for reimbursement to Medicare as part of numerous alleged healthcare fraud schemes. For his role in the alleged misconduct, Mr. Sabor agreed to pay a civil settlement of $150,000.\"Mr. Sabor’s misconduct in these healthcare fraud schemes was particularly egregious because USM continued to improperly bill Medicare even after it had been warned not to do so by an administrative law judge,\" stated U.S. Attorney Birge. \"Instead of following the rules, Mr. Sabor and USM found new ways to exploit the Medicare Program of hundreds of thousands of dollars. As the Government emphasized in its sentencing memorandum, ‘If you bill the government, learn the rules; if you are audited and found to be doing something wrong, rectify your practices; if a judge tells you to stop billing improperly, stop it. And if you don’t, expect to pay back the ill-gotten gains and anticipate a prison sentence.’\"\"The defendant’s conduct in this case was clearly motivated by greed,\" said Lamont Pugh III, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Office of Inspector General – Chicago Region (\"HHS-OIG\"). \"Billing for services not rendered, up-coding the actual services provided, billing for unlicensed personnel; these actions demonstrate a complete disregard for the law and resulted in a criminal conviction. The OIG will continue to work with our prosecutorial and law enforcement partners to ensure that those who commit these criminal acts are held accountable.\"\"Today’s sentence is the result of the dedicated efforts of multiple investigative agencies and prosecutors who collaborated to protect the integrity of the Medicare program,\" said Steven M. D’Antuono, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") in Michigan. \"Health care fraud costs our country billions of dollars a year and drives up the cost of care for every single taxpayer, but especially for the disabled and elderly citizens who are entitled to the benefits this program provides.\"This case was the result of a joint investigation by HHS-OIG, FBI, and the Food & Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, in coordination with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Michigan. Assistant U.S. Attorney Raymond E. Beckering III prosecuted the criminal case, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew J.

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASETuesday, June 30, 2020The chief executive officer of Indivior PLC, Shaun Thaxter, pleaded guilty today in federal court in Abingdon, Virginia to a one-count information charging him with causing the introduction into interstate commerce of the opioid drug Suboxone Film, which was misbranded in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.Thaxter served as Indivior’s top executive since 2009 (including the time period prior to December 2014 when Indivior was known as Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals).  Indivior announced yesterday that Thaxter is stepping down as chief executive officer. When Indivior was known as Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals it was a subsidiary of British conglomerate Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB Group). RB Group paid $1.4 billion in 2019 to resolve its liability to the United States and various states related to the marketing of Suboxone.Suboxone Film is a drug product approved for use by recovering opioid addicts to avoid or reduce withdrawal symptoms while they undergo treatment. Suboxone and its active ingredient, buprenorphine, are powerful and addictive opioids. Thaxter was charged in connection with Indivior’s misrepresentations to a state Medicaid program regarding the safety of Suboxone Film.“Our nation is confronting the deadliest drug crisis in American history. Opioid withdrawal is dangerous, difficult, and painful, and the people struggling to overcome addiction face challenges that can often seem insurmountable,” said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Michael D. Granston of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. “Opioid manufacturers, and the individuals charged with managing them, are obligated to ensure the opioid drugs they sell are marketed and distributed honestly, responsibly, and in compliance with the law.”“The public must be able to trust pharmaceutical manufacturers and their executives—particularly when they are marketing powerful opioids,” said First Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel P. Bubar of the Western District of Virginia. “While he was the top executive of Indivior, Shaun Thaxter violated that trust, and must be held accountable. I am very proud of the continued partnership between our office and the Virginia Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, FDA, HHS, and the U.S. Postal Service.”According to the criminal information filed in court today, Thaxter had authority over Indivior’s marketing and sales of Suboxone Film which, along with other Suboxone products, generated substantially all of the company’s revenue. In 2012, Thaxter oversaw and encouraged Indivior’s efforts to secure formulary coverage for Suboxone Film from the Massachusetts Medicaid agency called MassHealth. Thaxter asked Indivior employees under his direction to devise a strategy to win preferred drug status for Suboxone Film and counteract a non-opioid competitor MassHealth was considering for opioid-addiction treatment. Certain Indivior employees subsequently shared false and misleading safety information with MassHealth officials about Suboxone Film’s risk of accidental pediatric exposure. Two months after receiving that false and misleading information, MassHealth announced it would provide access to Suboxone Film for Medicaid patients with children under the age of six.Thaxter pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of violating the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by causing the distribution of misbranded Suboxone Film in interstate commerce. Under the terms of the plea agreement filed today, Thaxter has agreed to pay $600,000 in fines and forfeiture and faces up to one year in prison. Thaxter will be sentenced on Sept. 29, 2020, by U.S. District Court Judge James P. Jones in Abingdon, Virginia.“Opioid addiction and abuse is an immense public health crisis and taking steps to address it is one of the FDA’s highest priorities,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “Providing misleading information about relative product benefits could undermine efforts to provide affordable treatment to those suffering from this crisis. We will continue to work with the Department of Justice to investigate and hold accountable those who devise and participate in schemes to the detriment of the public health.”“The U.S. Postal Service spends billions of dollars per year in workers compensation-related costs, most of which are legitimate,” said Kenneth Cleevely, Special Agent in Charge of the Eastern Field Office for the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General.  “However, when medical providers or companies choose to flout the rules and profit illegally, special agents with the USPS OIG will work with our law enforcement partners to hold them responsible.  To report fraud or other criminal activity involving the Postal Service, contact our special agents atwww.uspsoig.govor 888-USPS-OIG.”“By valuing profits over patients, Thaxter’s directions endangered numerous Medicaid beneficiaries and their families, especially young children, with accidental opioid exposure. When treatment medications are used, it is essential they be prescribed carefully, legally, and based on accurate information, to protect the health and safety of patients in federal healthcare programs,” said Elton Malone, Assistant Inspector General for Investigations with the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “Protecting the health and safety of those served by Federal Healthcare Programs is of the utmost importance to OIG.  Along with our federal and state law enforcement partners we will continue working to protect beneficiaries from harm as a top priority.”“We are still in the middle of a deadly opioid crisis that has taken the lives of thousands of Virginians,” said Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring. “We cannot allow opioid manufacturers and their executive leadership to take advantage of this opioid epidemic and put profits over human lives just to sell more product.  I want to thank my Medicaid Fraud Control Unit as well as our local, state, and federal partners for their continued partnership on these important cases.”On April 9, 2019, a federal grand jury sitting in Abingdon, Virginia, indicted Indivior for allegedly engaging in an illicit nationwide scheme to increase prescriptions of Suboxone. The United States’ criminal trial against Indivior is scheduled to begin on September 28, 2020, in the U.S. District Court in Abingdon, Virginia.  Indivior is presumed innocent until proven guilty.The criminal cases against Thaxter and Indivior are being prosecuted by attorneys from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia and the Department of Justice’s Civil Division, including Albert P. Mayer, Randy Ramseyer, Kristin L. Gray, Joseph S. Hall, Janine M. Myatt, Garth W. Huston, Carol Wallack, Charles J. Biro, and Matthew J. Lash. The criminal investigation of Thaxter was handled by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations; the Virginia Medicaid Fraud Control Unit; the United States Postal Service - Office of Inspector General; and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services - Office of Inspector General. Assistance was provided by representatives of the FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel.Component(s):Civil DivisionPress Release Number:20-608"

Duncan, Jr., United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky. “Today’s guilty pleas are the product of close cooperation between two United States Attorney’s Offices and several law enforcement agencies and show our resolve in preventing fraud, waste, and abuse of the essential resources of government programs.”“Healthcare fraud not only wastes hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars, but it also undermines an important system that provides thousands of Virginians with critical medical services,” said Attorney General Mark Herring. “I am incredibly proud of the work my nationally-renowned Medicaid Fraud Control Unit has done and we will continue to work with our federal partners to pursue these egregious cases of fraud and abuse.”“Opioid addiction continues to be a public health emergency and it is important that treatment providers act with honesty and integrity in combatting the crisis. In cooperation with our federal and state law enforcement partners, we will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who defraud federal programs of resources to fight this epidemic,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Metro Washington Field Office.“The Medicare and Medicaid programs require providers to be truthful on all documents and claims submitted,” said Maureen R. Dixon, Special Agent in Charge of the Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “HHS-OIG will continue to work with our Federal and State partners to hold providers accountable for fraudulent actions and safeguard the Medicare and Medicaid programs from fraud, waste and abuse.”According to court documents, in March 2011, Michael Dube pleaded guilty in the Eastern District of Tennessee to one count of intentionally omitting information from reports as required under the Controlled Substances Act. As a result of his conviction, the Department of Health and Human Services [HHS] informed Dube in a letter dated June 29, 2012, that he was excluded from participating in any federal health care program.Nonetheless, in May 2013, Michael and Regan Dube established American Toxicology Labs [ATL] in Johnson City, Tennessee, with Regan Dube serving as the company’s registered agent, and using the couple’s home address as the principal office and mailing address. ATL then applied to participate in Medicare and Medicaid. On the applications, Regan Dube was listed as the owner of ATL, and Michael Dube’s name and participation in ATL was omitted.ATL conducted urine screens for various entities who represented themselves to be opioid treatment facilities. Between May 1, 2014, and January 31, 2020, Medicare, Virginia Medicaid, Kentucky Medicaid and TennCare made payments to ATL that totaled approximately $8.5 million. During this time, Michael Dube made employment decisions, negotiated business arrangements with providers, and otherwise participated in the management of ATL.In addition, Michael Dube also received kickback payments from third-parties for referring individuals to those third-parties for services for which payment was made (in whole or in part) by federal health care programs. These payments were deposited in Michael and Regan Dube’s personal checking account in a total amount of $441,646.As a result of their guilty pleas, Michael and Regan Dube will pay a total of $9,015,046, plus interest, to be divided between special assessments, fines, restitution, and forfeiture. They will have to repay all of the money they received from Medicare and Medicaid programs.The investigation of the case was conducted by the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, Virginia Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Virginia State Police, and Internal Revenue Service – Criminal Investigations, and the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. The prosecution of the case was conducted by the United States Attorneys’ Offices for the Western District of Virginia (by Special Assistant United States Attorney and Assistant Attorney General Janine Myatt, Assistant United States Attorneys Whit Pierce, Krista Frith, and Randy Ramseyer) and the Eastern District of Kentucky (by Andrew Smith and Gregory Rosenberg). The United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Tennessee provided valuable assistance.Topic(s):Health Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - Virginia, Western"

Doumar sentenced Lawrence B. Ryan, 48, to 10 months’ incarceration and ordered him to forfeit $316,153, which constitutes the proceeds from the offense. Ryan pleaded guilty in January to conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and to introduce misbranded drugs into interstate commerce.As part of his guilty plea, Ryan admitted that from October 2007 to September 2010, he approved more than 158,000 online drug orders for RX Limited, an international Internet pharmacy organization that sold prescription drugs without valid prescriptions to consumers in the United States. Ryan admitted that the drugs included Fioricet (which contains butalbital, a barbiturate that is a controlled substance), carisoprodol (Soma), and tramadol (Ultram).  RX Limited sent Ryan drug orders for approval as a participating physician. These drugs were sold to customers without a valid prescription, because there was no legitimate doctor-patient relationship between Ryan and the customers. Specifically, there was no face-to-face contact, no physical examination, no taking of patient histories, and no checking of the accuracy of information provided by the customers, including qualifying medical conditions. The drugs sold were therefore misbranded because they were introduced into interstate commerce without valid prescriptions.“The Department of Justice has long been committed to protecting consumers from those who unlawfully sell potentially harmful and addictive drugs to American consumers,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. “Ordering drugs on the Internet in the absence of a valid doctor-patient relationship is risky to consumers and can lead to impairment and addiction.”Senior Litigation Counsel Linda I. Marks of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan M. Salsbury of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia prosecuted the case. The Drug Enforcement Administration’s Minnesota office investigated the case, with assistance from the Internal Revenue Service and the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations.For more information about the Consumer Protection Branch and its enforcement efforts, visit its website athttp://www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch.  For more information about the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, visithttps://www.justice.gov/usao-edva.Component(s):Civil DivisionPress Release Number:20-564"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of New JerseyFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, June 5, 2020NEWARK, N.J. – A Chinese manufacturer was charged today with producing and exporting to the United States in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic nearly half a million misbranded and defective masks that falsely purported to be N95 respirators, U.S. Attorneys Craig Carpenito, District of New Jersey, and Richard P. Donoghue, Eastern District of New York, announced.King Year Packaging and Printing Co. Ltd. (King Year) is charged by complaint with three counts of violating the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) for causing misbranded and substandard respirators that falsely purported to meet the N95 standard to be imported into the United States. The complaint also charges the defendant with one felony count of making a false statement by filing misleading registration documents with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The criminal complaint was filed in Brooklyn federal court.“These charges demonstrate the continued commitment of the Department of Justice and our partners to aggressively pursue those who sell misbranded and defective personal protective equipment, whether they are located here or abroad,” Carpenito said. “We will aggressively investigate and charge manufacturers that put our medical professionals and first responders at risk in fighting this crisis.”“The charges alleged in this complaint show a blatant disregard for the safety of American citizens,” Acting FBI-Newark Special Agent in Charge Douglas Korneski said. “Had it not been for the actions of the investigative team, this defendant would have put first responders, hospital employees, and other front line workers directly in harm’s way with faulty equipment just to make a buck. The defendant tried to bypass the government's regulations by misbranding the quality of the equipment being peddled. The FBI remains vigilant in the pursuit of criminals trying to exploit the current crisis.”Attorney General William P. Barr created the COVID-19 Hoarding and Price Gouging Task Force, led by U.S. Attorney Carpenito, who is coordinating efforts with the Antitrust Division and U.S. Attorneys across the country wherever illegal activity involving protective personal equipment occurs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has issued a notice designating categories of health and medical supplies that must not be hoarded or sold for exorbitant prices.“U.S. Customs and Border Protection is proud of the expertise we bring to support and assist investigations by our law enforcement partners,” Troy Miller, Director, CBP New York Field Office, said.  “It is through interagency partnerships and collaborative efforts, like the one leading to today’s charges that we send a message to foreign manufacturers on the importance of understanding and complying with US health, safety, and import laws.”“The FDA is actively monitoring the marketplace for fraudulent products related to our battle against COVID-19. The agency will continue to collaborate with our fellow law enforcement partners to bring to justice those who place profits above the public health during this pandemic,” Jeffrey J. Ebersole, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ New York Field Office, said. “Today’s announcement should serve as a reminder that we will take appropriate action against those who jeopardize the health of Americans while taking advantage of a crisis.”According to the complaint:From April 6, 2020, to April 21, 2020, King Year manufactured 495,200 defective and misbranded masks that claimed to be N95 respirators, and caused those defective products to be imported into the United States. King Year stamped the NIOSH and FDA logos on the packaging for its respirators, appealing directly to healthcare personnel, when in fact, its respirators were not NIOSH-approved, nor were they approved, cleared, or otherwise authorized by the FDA. King Year’s respirators also were embroidered with “N95,” even though they fell well below the minimum 95 percent filtration standard.King Year’s misbranded and defective products had the potential to deceive U.S. consumers, including healthcare workers and first responders, into believing they were purchasing authentic N95 respirators, and put them at risk. To cover up the poor quality of its respirators, King Year disseminated false documents attesting to their authenticity and filed a fraudulent registration statement with the FDA.Each charge carries a maximum fine of $500,000 or the greater of twice the gross gain or twice the gross loss from the offense.Please report COVID-19 fraud, hoarding or price-gouging to the National Center for Disaster Fraud’s National Hotline at (866) 720-5721, or e-mail:disaster@leo.gov.The government is represented by Assistant United States Attorney Jonathan Fayer of the Economic Crimes Unit for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey.The charges in the complaint are merely allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.Attachment(s):Download KingYear.Complaint.pdfTopic(s):CoronavirusComponent(s):USAO - New JerseyPress Release Number:20-170"

Also, Patterson Companies, Inc. (Patterson) Animal Health International’s corporate parent, entered into a non-prosecution agreement in which it committed to enhance its compliance program and fully comply with the law. United States Attorney Thomas T. Cullen and Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office, made the announcement today.Pursuant to the agreements entered into by Animal Health International and Patterson, Animal Health International admitted to introducing and causing the introduction and delivery into interstate commerce of veterinary prescription drugs that were misbranded and agreed to pay $1 million to the Virginia Department of Health Professionals, a $5 million fine, and a forfeiture money judgement of $46,802,203. In past 18 months, Patterson has fully cooperated in the investigation and implemented changes to International’s and its compliance programs to prevent further violations of federal and state law.“Today’s conviction demonstrates that our office will not tolerate when entities or individuals illegally bypass the important safeguards that exist to protect our nation’s food sources,” First Assistant United States Attorney Daniel P. Bubar said today. “We will continue to work closely with our partner agencies to make sure that veterinary drug distributors uphold their important obligations.”“The FDA recognizes the importance of controlling the prescription drug supply for animals. The careless or uncontrolled distribution of prescription animal drugs poses a danger not only to the medicated animals but to the U.S. public health by increasing the risk that humans will become resistant to antibiotics that we unknowingly consume through our food supply.,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office.  “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who distribute prescription animal drugs unlawfully.”The Food and Drug Administration’s restrictions on veterinary prescription drugs are not primarily to protect animals from the potential harms of prescription drugs, but are to protect the human food supply from unsafe drug residues in the edible tissues of animals sold for slaughter. Common causes of illegal residues include: (1) exceeding the drug’s approved dose; (2) using a shorter withdrawal period than what is stated on the drug’s label (if a higher than approved dose is given, the labeled withdrawal period may not be enough to allow the drug in the edible tissues to deplete to levels that are at or below the tolerance); (3) using a drug in an extra-label manner (for indications and dosages outside the approved labeling) without a veterinarian’s involvement; (4) giving a drug not approved for that species; and (5) using an unapproved route of administration. Drug residues in the nation's drug supply are concerning because: (1) they may contribute to antibiotic resistance in the human population, rendering human drugs less effective to treat human disease and contributing to the mutations of “superbugs”; and (2) they may cause allergic reactions in individuals with certain drug allergies.According to court documents, from 2012 through 2018, Animal Health International caused misbranded veterinary prescription drug shipments to be made throughout the United States by distributing veterinary drugs from its wholesale locations directly to end users and by distributing veterinary drugs to unlicensed individuals.Two such unlicensed individuals, Marlin Webb and Billy K. Groce, were not properly licensed to receive, transport, store, distribute, or dispense veterinary prescription drugs. Webb was the store manager of a cooperative in Hillsville, Virginia. The cooperative was not a licensed wholesaler, pharmacy, or veterinary clinic. Groce operated an unlicensed veterinary prescription distribution business.  Webb and Groce each obtained veterinary prescription drugs from Animal Health International in interstate commerce without valid prescriptions, and on many occasions, with no prescriptions at all. Webb and Groce previously pled guilty to criminal charges for their conduct in United States District Court in Abingdon.While, as stated in the charge to which Animal Health International pleaded guilty, Animal Health International obtained not less than $46,802,203 from its illegal shipments, its profits from such shipments were a small percentage of the amount received.United States District Judge James P.

Bash; FBI Special Agent in Charge Luis M. Quesada, El Paso Field Office; and, Special Agent in Charge Charles L. Grinstead, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations, Kansas City Field Office.The purpose of the civil injunction is to stop Travalino’s sale of fraudulent COVID-19 cures through his business and his website, “whiteeaglenativeherbs.net.”  Court records state that after guaranteeing an undercover special agent that his hospitalized grandmother would not die from COVID-19 if given the medicine, Travalino allegedly sold the agent a treatment for COVID-19 on May 5, 2020.  On May 14, 2020, the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sent Travalino a warning letter requiring him to cease and desist sales of unapproved and unproven products related to COVID-19 cures and treatments.  But almost a week after he was warned to stop, Travalino again sold his fraudulent COVID-19 treatments to another undercover agent.Today’s action will shutter Travalino’s website immediately while this investigation continues.  In so doing, the government is employing a federal statute that permits federal courts to issue injunctions to prevent harm to potential victims of fraudulent schemes.“I am pleased that the district court entered the temporary restraining order.  Peddling bogus COVID-19 cures to fellow citizens is illegal and immoral.  Our office will continue to shut down these scams,” stated U.S. Attorney Bash.“The sale of false cures will be vigorously investigated by the FBI,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Quesada.  “The FBI is using a variety of tools to identify anyone who exploits the current crisis with fraudulent scams or a variety of cyber schemes – and is proactively warning the public about products claiming to save lives, before losing their money or creating false hope.  Scammers seeking to profit by exploiting fear and uncertainty during this COVID-19 pandemic will be brought to justice.”The Department of Justice recommends that Americans to take the following precautionary measures to protect themselves from known and emerging scams related to COVID-19:• Independently verify the identity of any company, charity, or individual that contacts you regarding COVID-19.• Check the websites and email addresses offering information, products, or services related to COVID-19.  Be aware that scammers often employ addresses that differ only slightly from those belonging to the entities they are impersonating.  For example, they might use “cdc.com” or “cdc.org” instead of “cdc.gov.”• Be wary of unsolicited emails offering information, supplies, or treatment for COVID-19 or requesting your personal information for medical purposes.  Legitimate health authorities will not contact the general public this way.• Do not click on links or open email attachments from unknown or unverified sources.  Doing so could download a virus onto your computer or device.• Make sure the anti-malware and anti-virus software on your computer is operating and up to date.• Ignore offers for a COVID-19 vaccine, cure, or treatment.  Remember, if a vaccine becomes available, you won’t hear about it for the first time through an email, online ad, or unsolicited sales pitch.• Check online reviews of any company offering COVID-19 products or supplies.  Avoid companies whose customers have complained about not receiving items.• Research any charities or crowdfunding sites soliciting donations in connection with COVID-19 before giving any donation.  Remember, an organization may not be legitimate even if it uses words like “CDC” or “government” in its name or has reputable looking seals or logos on its materials.  For online resources on donating wisely, visit the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) website.• Be wary of any business, charity, or individual requesting payments or donations in cash, by wire transfer, gift card, or through the mail.  Don’t send money through any of these channels.• Be cautious of “investment opportunities” tied to COVID-19, especially those based on claims that a small company’s products or services can help stop the virus.  If you decide to invest, carefully research the investment beforehand.  For information on how to avoid investment fraud, visit the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website.For the most up-to-date information on COVID-19, consumers may visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO websites.  In addition, the public is urged to report suspected fraud schemes related to COVID-19 by calling the National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF) hotline (1-866-720-5721) or by e-mailing the NCDF atdisaster@leo.gov.The enforcement action taken today is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Cannizzaro, Eddie Castillo and Michael C. Galdo of the Western District of Texas, and Senior Litigation Counsel Ross S. Goldstein of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch.  Special Agents with the FDA and the FBI’s El Paso Field Office are conducting the investigation.The claims made in the complaint are allegations that, if the case were to proceed to trial, the government must prove to receive a permanent injunction against the defendant.Additional information about the Consumer Protection Branch and its enforcement efforts may be found atwww.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch.  For more information about the United States Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas, visit its website atwww.justice.gov/usao-wdtx.  For information about the Department of Justice’s efforts to stop COVID-19 fraud, visitwww.justice.gov/coronavirus.#####The year 2020 marks the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice.  Learn more about the history of our agency atwww.Justice.gov/Celebrating150Years.Topic(s):CoronavirusComponent(s):USAO - Texas, Western"

(Meds2Go), a pharmacy located in Alum Creek in Lincoln County, was sentenced for money laundering, announced United States Attorney Mike Stuart. The money laundering conviction arose out of a conspiracy between the pharmacy and Hope Clinic, a pain clinic operating as a pill mill, to dispense compound opioids for no legitimate medical purpose and outside the bounds of professional medical practice. As part of the plea agreement in December 2019, Meds2Go was shut down and has now been ordered to pay $250,000 toward community restitution and forfeiture.  The community restitution will be paid for the costs associated with drug abuse treatment in West Virginia to redress the harm caused by illicit opioid usage stemming from the sale of prescription opioids.  The West Virginia Crime Victim's Compensation Fund will receive 65% of the community restitution amount, and 35% will be paid to West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources, Bureau of Behavioral Health and Health Facilities.“Meds2Go betrayed the trust of the communities it served and our citizens.

We will continue to hold those that place greed above their solemn obligation to serve the best health of our citizens.”Meds2Go previously admitted that in 2014 and 2015 it filled prescriptions written by physicians employed by Hope Clinic, despite its knowledge that there was no legitimate medical purpose for the prescriptions and that they were prescribed outside the usual course of medical practice. In order to maximize corporate profits, the pharmacy ignored numerous red flags that should have prevented them from dispensing the prescription medications written by Hope Clinic, such as: (1) an abnormally high amount of prescriptions for widely-abused, highly-addictive controlled substances such as oxycodone; (2) prescribed controlled substances to patients for long periods of time; (3) permitted refills before prior prescriptions should have run out; (4) ignored obvious signs that patients were drug addicts; (5) patients travelled long distances and from out of state; (6) multiple Hope Clinic physicians issued prescriptions to the same patient; (7) numerous family members who were all patients of Hope Clinic, came to the pharmacy at the same time; (8) insurance companies refused to pay for prescriptions from Hope Clinic; and (9) cash-only transactions.Meds2Go further admitted that it engaged in illegal manufacturing of its own supply of oxycodone and methadone due to supply and demand by compounding pills in mass quantities at its locations in Alum Creek and Charleston. Due to the excessive amount of prescriptions for controlled substances written by Hope Clinic, the pharmacy could not obtain enough of a supply of oxycodone and methadone from its distributors. In order to keep up with the demand, the pharmacy bypassed purchase restrictions from the distributor by setting up and purchasing compounding equipment, training its employees to compound pills on a mass scale, purchasing powders and other raw materials, and manufacturing pills containing oxycodone and methadone. The compounded pills were then sold to cash-paying customers who had prescriptions written by Hope Clinic. The pharmacy used the proceeds from the illegal manufacturing and dispensing to carry on the operations of business.United States District Judge Irene C. Berger imposed the sentence. The investigation was conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration – Office of Inspector General (OIG) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services – Office of Inspector General (OIG). Assistant United States Attorneys Andrew Tessman and Steven I. Loew handled the prosecution.###Topic(s):OpioidsPrescription DrugsComponent(s):USAO - West Virginia, Southern"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeNorthern District of IowaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, May 29, 2020Replaced Dozens of Vials of Fentanyl with Saline in a Hospital’s Surgery and Birthing CentersA Charles City nurse anesthetist who secretly tampered with vials of fentanyl in a hospital’s surgery and birthing centers was sentenced today to nearly three years in federal prison.Christopher Scott West, age 46, from Charles City, Iowa, received the prison term after an August 1, 2019 guilty plea to one count of tampering with a consumer product and one count of acquiring and attempting to acquire a controlled substance by means of misrepresentation, fraud, deception, and subterfuge.At the guilty plea and other hearings in the case, the evidence showed that, beginning in 2017, West was a certified nurse anesthetist (CRNA) at a hospital in Charles City.  From February 2018 through September 7, 2018, West used his State of Iowa nursing licenses to gain access to two controlled substances, fentanyl and sufentanil, at the hospital.  The fentanyl and sufentanil was intended for patients at the hospital, but West used them himself.  In order to avoid getting caught, West perforated tamper-proof paper around the vials, carefully opened the vials, replaced the drugs in the vials with saline, glued the vials shut, and placed the vials back in the hospital’s secure dispensaries in the surgery and birthing centers.The hospital discovered West’s scheme on September 7, 2018, when a hospital visitor discovered West passed out in a public bathroom. West had a rubber tourniquet and empty and full vials of propofol, another drug used in anesthesia, in his coat pocket.  After the hospital declined West’s request to keep his drug theft scheme “internal,” West told the hospital’s pharmacist that she needed to remove vials of what were supposed to contain narcotics in the surgery center because he did not want those adulterated narcotics used on patients.  The pharmacist found tampered vials of fentanyl in the surgery center.  However, over the ensuing weekend, the pharmacist also checked the hospital’s birthing center.  The pharmacist also found tampered vials in the birthing center, too.  In total, the hospital discovered 28 tampered vials of fentanyl and 15 tampered vials of sufentanil in the hospital’s secure dispensaries.On September 9, 2018, West admitted to the hospital’s surgeon that West had administered three different forms of anesthesia to a young patient in part so that he would have narcotics left over for his personal use.  The patient suffered complications from his surgery and required an extra day in the hospital and intermittent catheterizations.  A subsequent review of other procedures West allegedly performed revealed that West had purported to use fentanyl consistently in colonoscopies and cataract surgeries as early as December 2017.  A prior review of West’s obstetrics patients in 2018 revealed that one in four of West’s spinal anesthesia patients received narcotics that were insufficient to reduce labor pain, such that the women giving birth also required general anesthesia.West was sentenced in Cedar Rapids by United States District Court Judge C.J. Williams.  West was sentenced to 34 months’ imprisonment and fined $15,000.  He was ordered to make $31,998.34 in restitution to the hospital and ordered to pay $3,158.18 in costs of prosecution.  He must also serve a three-year term of supervised release after the prison term.  There is no parole in the federal system.  The district court also ordered West to forfeit his two State of Iowa nursing licenses to the United States because defendant used those licenses to further his drug diversion scheme.“Medical professionals have an obligation to care for some of the most vulnerable members of our society,” said United States Attorney Peter Deegan.  “By his selfish actions, Mr. West took advantage of his trusted position at his local community hospital.  He endangered the health and very lives of patients at the hospital.  This sentence sends a clear message that such dangerous behavior will not be tolerated.”“The FDA oversees the U.S. drug supply to ensure that it is safe and effective, and those who knowingly tamper with medicines put patients’ health at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L. Grinstead, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Kansas City Field Office. “We will continue to protect the public health and bring to justice health care professionals who take advantage of their unique position and compromise their patients’ health and comfort by tampering with needed drugs.”West was released on the bond previously set and is to surrender to the United States Marshal on a date yet to be set.  The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Tim Vavricek and investigated by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, the Iowa Division of Narcotics Enforcement, and the Charles City Police Department.Court file information athttps://ecf.iand.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/login.pl.The case file number is 19-CR-2013.Topic(s):OpioidsHealth Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - Iowa, Northern"

These cartridges contained a liquid that, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), may contain extraordinarily high THC levels ranging from 40% to 80%. This form of marijuana can be up to four times stronger in THC content than high-grade marijuana, which normally measures around 20% THC levels.In addition to the THC cartridges, agents recovered four firearms, ammunition, and $85,627 in United States currency.  Agents also discovered that Michl purchased an all-terrain vehicle with drug trafficking proceeds in February of 2019.An indictment is only a charge and is not evidence of guilt.  A defendant is entitled to a fair trial in which it will be the government’s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.If convicted, the defendant’s sentence will be determined by the Court after review of factors unique to this case, including the defendant’s prior criminal records, if any, the defendant’s role in the offense and the characteristics of the violation.  In all cases, the sentence will not exceed the statutory maximum and in most cases, it will be less than the maximum.The investigation was conducted by the FDA – Office of Criminal Investigations in conjunction with the Ohio Attorney General’s Organized Crime Commission Major Crimes Task Force which consists of the Cuyahoga County Sheriff’s Department, Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations.

Williams announced today that a Gresham, Oregon man has been charged with illegally purchasing, importing, and offering for sale chloroquine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in prescription drugs used to treat malaria.Matthew Owens, 42, has been charged by criminal complaint with smuggling and the receipt in interstate commerce of misbranded drugs and the delivery thereof for pay.“Together, Americans are facing a public health emergency without precedent in our lifetimes. We are heartened by the countless examples of public service by front-line health workers, law enforcement, and ordinary Americans alike. These heroic acts of service inspire us all,” said U.S. Attorney Williams. “And yet, there are some individuals actively trying to profit off the pandemic, and, in the process, putting more lives as risk. We will not let these selfish and dangerous criminal acts continue unchecked.”“Drugs that are produced and distributed outside the FDA’s oversight present the prospect of harm to the public health. The FDA’s drug approval process is designed to ensure that patients receive safe and effective drugs,” said Special Agent in Charge Lisa L. Malinowski, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI) Los Angeles Field Office. “The FDA will not tolerate those who attempt to place the public health at risk, especially during a pandemic and we will take appropriate action to protect consumers from bad actors who take advantage of a crisis to deceive the public.”“It’s unconscionable that individuals would prioritize their own greed over the health of others, particularly during a public health crisis,” said Eben Roberts, Acting Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Seattle. “Illicit distribution of narcotics put unsuspecting consumers at serious risk. HSI, and our law enforcement partners, will continue to seek and bring to justice anyone who attempts to use the current health emergency to exploit others.”According to court documents, on April 13, 2020, HSI contacted FDA-OCI after a package containing 122.8 grams of a white powder was intercepted at a FedEx facility in Memphis, Tennessee. The package originated in Xiaoshan, China, and was addressed to Owens’ Gresham apartment. The enclosed substance was declared as ammonium polyphosphate but was later determined to be chloroquine. An invoice included with the substance described it as a “sample” having “no commercial value”, statements commonly used by persons improperly importing items and attempting to avoid detection.Investigators searched FDA records and found neither “Hangzhou Weishi Electronic Commerce Co Ltd,” the entity who shipped the package, nor “Matthew Owens” as having registered any drug manufacturing facilities. A search of Oregon Medical Board, Oregon Board of Pharmacy, and Oregon State Board of Nursing public databases found no records indicating that Owens was a physician, pharmacist, or registered nurse.As the investigation continued, special agents from FDA-OCI and HSI learned that two additional shipments were sent from China to Owens’ apartment. One contained resveratrol, a chemical commonly found in dietary supplements. The second contained polyacrylamide, a chemical compound primarily used in wastewater treatment, but also as an ingredient in certain cosmetics.On April 27, 2020, agents from HSI, FDA-OCI, FBI, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) executed a search at Owens’ apartment. They seized laptop computers, cell phones, an unopened bag of clear, empty capsules for encapsulating pharmaceuticals, a foil bag containing an unknown powder, and a material safety data sheet for polyacrylamide.A forensic search of Owens’ cell phones and Facebook Messenger messages associated with his cell phone number revealed conversations discussing the purchase and receipt of chloroquine from Alibaba.com, the world’s largest online business-to-business trading platform. Other messages discussed the offering of chloroquine for sale as a treatment for COVID-19.Owens made his first appearance in federal court today after having been served a summons to appear on May 8, 2020. If convicted, Owens faces a maximum sentence of 23 years in federal prison, 3 years’ supervised release, and a $500,000 fine.A criminal complaint is only an accusation of a crime, and a defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.This case was investigated by the FDA-OCI and HSI with assistance from the FBI and U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS). It is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Oregon.On March 27, 2020, the FDA issued a public notice warning of the dangers of using chloroquine phosphate and warning the public to be wary of anyone claiming to have a product to prevent or cure COVID-19. The U.S. Attorney’s Office joins the FDA in imploring the public not to take any form of chloroquine unless it has been prescribed by a licensed healthcare provider and is obtained through a legitimate source.If you or someone you know is in danger or experiencing a health emergency, please call 911.The year 2020 marks the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice.

United States Attorney Thomas T. Cullen and Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack of the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office, made the announcement today.“Manufacturers and distributors of nutritional supplements must ensure that that their products do not contain FDA-restricted substances, and they must accurately label those products,” U.S. Attorney Cullen stated today. “We will continue to work closely with the FDA to investigate and prosecute individuals and entities who unlawfully market and dispense products that are essentially prescription drugs.”“U.S. consumers should be able to trust that the dietary supplements they buy do not contain dangerous drug ingredients. When criminals disguise potent drugs as dietary supplements, they place consumers at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Metro Washington Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who peddle these dangerous products.”Today in federal court, Spencer Gill, 31, of Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif. and Anthony Novak, 46, of Anaheim, Calif., were each sentenced to one-year of probation. In addition, the defendants were ordered to forfeit $130,000. Gill and Spencer both previously pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).According to court documents, between March 2013 and April 2018, Gill and Novak conspired to operate multiple business entities and websites selling drugs and other products to the bodybuilding community as part of a scheme to defraud the FDA. Some of these drugs contained ingredients that were not approved by the FDA for human use and were to be dispensed only under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer them, meaning they were prescription drugs.Gill and Novak caused many of the drugs they sold to be labeled “for research purposes only.” The defendants caused similar disclaimers to be posted on various websites with the knowledge such representations were false and fraudulent. Gill and Novak admitted to marketing and selling the drugs to customers who intended to, and did, consume the drugs and only claimed the drugs were for “research purposes only” to avoid regulatory oversight by the FDA.The investigation of this case was conducted by the United States Food and Drug Administration.

Birge announced today separate charges brought against Roger D. Beyer, M.D., and his wife, Susan E. Wright, N.P., J.D. Dr. Beyer was the owner of Women’s Health Care Specialists, P.C. (\"WHCS\"), an obstetrics-gynecology practice in Kalamazoo, and Urological Solutions of Michigan, PLC (\"USM\"), a medical practice consisting of traveling nurse practitioners in West Michigan.The Felony Information filed against Dr. Beyer charges him with conspiracy to commit health care fraud. The United States alleges that Dr. Beyer conspired to fraudulently bill Medicare for therapy services, known as pelvic muscle rehabilitation (\"PMR\") therapy, provided by USM, using more-lucrative and inappropriate diagnostic codes. The PMR therapy was provided purportedly to treat mostly elderly female patients with fecal or urinary incontinence, primarily in the greater Traverse City, Kalamazoo, and Grand Rapids areas.The United States also alleges in the Felony Information that Dr. Beyer directed his staff at USM and WHCS to reuse a single-user (one patient only) rectal pressure sensor on multiple patients as part of the PMR therapy. Additionally, the United States alleges that WHCS staff also reused a single-use (disposable, one use only) anorectal manometry catheter on multiple patients as part of an initial diagnostic study with patients with potential fecal incontinence. Both instances of reuse were inconsistent with the device clearance by the Food & Drug Administration (\"FDA\") and the devices’ instructions for use. Further, this reuse resulted in the adulteration and possible contamination of these devices.In a separate Felony Information, the United States charges Ms. Wright with misprision of health care fraud and the adulteration of a medical device. The United States alleges that Ms. Wright knew that USM fraudulently billed Medicare for evaluation and management (\"E&M\") services to patients on the same date of service as the PMR therapy, but she never informed authorities. The Felony Information against Ms. Wright similarly charges her with adulteration of a medical device, specifically the rectal pressure sensor in the manner described above for Dr. Beyer.Both Dr. Beyer and Ms. Wright have signed plea agreements in their respective cases, and plea hearings are scheduled for May 15, 2020.USM patients who were also Medicare beneficiaries may have been charged copays for the billing of their PMR therapy using the more lucrative diagnostic codes. Those same patients may also have been improperly charged copays for E&M services billed alongside their PMR therapy. Additionally, patients of USM and WHCS who received PMR therapy or diagnostic anorectal manometry may have been the recipients of services using adulterated medical devices. This adulteration posed a risk of infectious disease transmission. Such patients can review the press release issued by the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services on June 11, 2019, encouraging patients of Dr. Beyer and his practices to consult with their treating physicians about undergoing any testing:https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/0,5885,7-339--499502--,00.htmlIndividuals who may have been affected by the fraudulent billing or device adulteration can contact the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Michigan to obtain information about victim rights and the progression of these cases.

(“API”), a pharmacy located in Mingo County, has agreed to pay civil monetary penalties to resolve allegations that the pharmacy violated the Controlled Substances Act by filling illegitimate prescriptions, United States Attorney Mike Stuart announced today. API has also entered into a three-year compliance agreement with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) that imposes heightened reporting and oversight requirements and sanctions for non-compliance.Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, API agreed to pay $88,085.73 to resolve allegations that it had filled prescriptions for controlled substances that were not valid at its location in Gilbert between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2015. During this time, API filled compound opioid prescriptions issued by physicians affiliated with Hitech Opioid Pharmachovigilance Expertise Clinic, PLLC (HOPE Clinic), even though API “knew or should have known that said prescriptions were not issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his/her professional practice,” according to the settlement agreement.The Controlled Substances Act prohibits the distribution or dispensing of a controlled substance without a valid prescription. A valid prescription for a controlled substance must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his or her practice. The investigation indicated that the pharmacist-in-charge at the pharmacy should have known that patients had presented illegitimate prescriptions that should not have been filled.“The diversion of prescription opioids fueled an epidemic and devastated a countless number of West Virginia families,” said United States Attorney Mike Stuart. “When pharmacies ignore red flags indicative of illegitimate opioid prescriptions for the sake of profits, we will use every available criminal and civil enforcement tool to hold them accountable.”“Pharmacists serve on the front lines of America’s opioid epidemic and they share responsibility with physicians to protect those whom they serve from the dangers associated with prescription medications,” said Special Agent in Charge Todd Scott, of DEA’s Louisville Division. “DEA will use every available tool to hold accountable those in the pharmacy industry who choose to put profit over customer safety,” Scott added.The DEA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services – Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) and the Food and Drug Administration – Office of Criminal Investigation conducted the investigation. The case was handled by Assistant United States Attorney Alan McGonigal.The settlement is a result of the United States Attorney’s Healthcare Fraud Abuse, Recovery and Response Team (ARREST), an innovative approach linking civil and criminal enforcement efforts together in a comprehensive attack on the opioid epidemic and healthcare fraud.###Topic(s):OpioidsComponent(s):USAO - West Virginia, Southern"

        "content": "Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, May 1, 2020Texas-based ice cream manufacturer Blue Bell Creameries L.P. agreed to plead guilty to charges it shipped contaminated products linked to a 2015 listeriosis outbreak, and the company’s former president was charged in connection with a scheme to cover up the incident, the Justice Department announced today.In a plea agreement filed with a criminal information in federal court in Austin, Texas, Blue Bell agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts of distributing adulterated ice cream products and pay a criminal fine and forfeiture amount totaling $17.25 million.  Blue Bell also agreed to pay an additional $2.1 million to resolve civil False Claims Act allegations regarding ice cream products manufactured under insanitary conditions and sold to federal facilities.  The total $19.35 million in fine, forfeiture, and civil settlement payments constitutes the second largest-ever amount paid in resolution of a food-safety matter.In a related case, Blue Bell’s former president, Paul Kruse, also was charged with seven felony counts related to his alleged efforts to conceal from customers what the company knew about the listeria contamination.“American consumers rely on food manufacturers to take necessary steps to provide products that are safe to eat,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division.  “The Department of Justice will take appropriate action where food manufacturers ignore poor factory conditions or fail to abide by required recall procedures when problems are discovered.”The plea agreement and criminal information filed today against Blue Bell in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas alleges that the company distributed ice cream products that were manufactured under insanitary conditions and contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, in violation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.  According to the plea agreement, Texas state officials notified Blue Bell in February 2015 that two ice cream products from the company’s Brenham, Texas factory tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes, a dangerous pathogen that can lead to serious illness or death in vulnerable populations such as pregnant women, newborns, the elderly, and those with compromised immune systems.  Blue Bell directed its delivery route drivers to remove remaining stock of the two products from store shelves, but the company did not recall the products or issue any formal communication to inform customers about the potential listeria contamination.  Two weeks after receiving notification of the first positive listeria tests, Texas state officials informed Blue Bell that additional testing confirmed listeria in a third product.  Blue Bell again chose not to issue any formal notification to customers regarding the positive tests.In March 2015, tests conducted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) linked the strain of listeria in one of the Blue Bell ice cream products to a strain that sickened five patients at a Kansas hospital with listeriosis, the severe illness caused by ingestion of listeria-contaminated food.  The FDA, CDC, and Blue Bell all issued public recall notifications on March 13, 2015.  Subsequent tests confirmed listeria contamination in a product made at another Blue Bell facility in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, which led to a second recall announcement on March 23, 2015.“The health of American consumers and the safety of our food are too important to be thwarted by the criminal acts of any individual or company,” said Judith A. McMeekin, Pharm.D., Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs, FDA.  “Americans expect and deserve the highest standards of food safety and integrity and we will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who put the public health at risk by distributing contaminated foods in the U.S. marketplace.”“This settlement demonstrates the commitment of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and our law enforcement partners to hold companies accountable for failing to abide by important contract requirements,” said Robert E. Craig Jr., Special Agent in Charge of the DCIS Mid-Atlantic Field Office.  “This case has been particularly concerning because of the disregard of basic food safety rules and the impact those actions can have on the health and safety of the Defense Department's service members and their families.”“The health and safety of our military members and their families is critical to the Department of Defense and mission readiness,” said Michael C. Mentavlos, Special Agent in Charge of the DCIS Southwest Field Office.  “We take all criminal acts, including those that raise grave health concerns, seriously, and DCIS will always place a premium on the well-being of our service members, their dependents, and our veterans.”According to the plea agreement with the company, FDA inspections in March and April 2015 revealed sanitation issues at the Brenham and Broken Arrow facilities, including problems with the hot water supply needed to properly clean equipment and deteriorating factory conditions that could lead to insanitary circumstances.  Blue Bell temporarily closed all of its plants in late April 2015 to clean and update the facilities.  Since re-opening its facilities in late 2015, Blue Bell has taken significant steps to enhance sanitation processes and enact a program to test products for listeria prior to shipment.According to the allegations filed against Kruse, Blue Bell’s former president allegedly orchestrated a scheme to deceive certain Blue Bell customers after he learned that products from the company’s Texas factory tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes.  Kruse specifically is asserted to have directed other Blue Bell employees to remove potentially contaminated products from store freezers without notifying retailers or consumers about the real reason for the withdrawal.  Kruse also is alleged to have directed employees to tell customers who asked why products were removed that there had been an unspecified issue with a manufacturing machine instead of that samples of the products had tested positive for listeria.The civil False Claims Act settlement with the company resolves allegations that Blue Bell shipped ice cream products manufactured in insanitary conditions to U.S. facilities, and later failed to abide by contractually required recall procedures when its employees removed products from federal purchasers’ freezers without properly disclosing details about the potentially contaminated ice cream to the appropriate federal officials.The allegations filed against Kruse merely assert that crimes have been committed. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.Except as admitted in the plea agreement, the False Claims Act claims resolved by the settlement with the company are allegations only and there has been no determination of liability.Trial Attorneys Patrick Hearn and Matt Lash of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch prosecuted the case with assistance from Shannon Singleton and Michael Varrone of the FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel.  The criminal investigation was conducted by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations and the Department of Defense's DCIS.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas provided substantial assistance.The civil False Claims Act investigation was led by Trial Attorney Michael Podberesky of the Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch, with investigative support from the Department of Defense's DCIS.For more information about the enforcement efforts of the Consumer Protection Branch and the Fraud Section of the Commercial Litigation Branch, visit their websites athttp://www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branchandhttps://www.justice.gov/civil/fraud-section.Topic(s):False Claims ActComponent(s):Civil DivisionPress Release Number:20-416"

Joshua Radcliffe, 36, of Shady Springs, previously pled guilty to conspiring with Mark T. Radcliffe to using and carrying firearms in relation to maintaining drug-involved premises.“Even though Joshua Radcliffe was not a prescribing physician, today he was held accountable for his role in fueling the opioid epidemic in West Virginia,” said United States Attorney Mike Stuart. “The opiate crisis ravaged our good state and affected every single citizen in one way or another.

Radcliffe admitted that HOPE Clinic was predominately a cash-based business and that the physicians at HOPE Clinic issued prescriptions for oxycodone to its customers not for legitimate medical purposes and outside the bounds of professional medical practice. Radcliffe worked at the Beckley and Beaver locations of the HOPE Clinic as the Clinic Manager. As the Clinic Manager, Radcliffe admitted to running the daily operations of the clinics and that PPPFD management made medical decisions that should have been made by the physicians and not by PPPFD employees.  Because the customers coming to both the Beckley and Beaver HOPE Clinic locations were seeking Schedule II controlled substances to feed their addiction or to distribute illegally, Radcliffe admitted that he carried a firearm to work. He and others in management at PPPFD encouraged other PPPFD employees, especially the narcotic auditors and clinic managers, to carry firearms to work for protection because of the customers and the amount of cash coming into the clinics each day.The investigation was conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services - Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), the Internal Revenue Service – Criminal Investigations, the Food and Drug Administration – Office of Criminal Investigations, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the West Virginia State Police, the Kentucky State Police, the Beckley Police Department, the Virginia State Police, the Charleston Police Department, and the Drug Enforcement Administration.United States District Judge Frank W. Volk imposed the sentence. Assistant United States Attorneys Monica D. Coleman and Steven Loew are handling the prosecution.###Topic(s):OpioidsFirearms OffensesComponent(s):USAO - West Virginia"

Moran.  RICHARD MARSCHALL, 67, is scheduled to make his initial appearance via teleconference in U.S. District Court in Tacoma on May 12, 2020, on a charge of Introduction of Misbranded Drugs into Interstate Commerce.“At a time when scientists are scrambling to identify COVID-19 treatments and vaccines, it is unconscionable and cruel to take people’s money for false hope and promises of a cure,” said U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran.  “This defendant knew better than to be peddling misbranded drugs.  Fortunately, the community quickly notified law enforcement when they saw he had launched this scheme with a COVID-19 twist.”According to the criminal complaint, on March 26, 2020, Food and Drug Administration criminal investigators began reviewing complaints from the public regarding postings on Facebook and a website linked to MARSCHALL that claimed the “Dynamic Duo” of substances could kill viruses, including the coronavirus.  MARSCHALL billed himself as a “Health Coach” and retired naturopath.  Various posts promote two substances that can “stop” coronavirus.On March 30, 2020, an FDA investigator spoke to MARSCHALL on the telephone in an undercover capacity.  MARSCHALL represented to the investigator that one of the substances “doesn’t boost the immune system, it just kills the virus.”  MARSCHALL represented that the second substance would boost the production of white blood cells that attack infections.  The undercover agent ultimately ordered the “Dynamic Duo” for $140 plus shipping.The substances were received by FDA investigators in early April, along with documents.  A review showed they were manufactured in facilities in Illinois and Texas.  The original labeling for the substances does not claim to kill viruses, but still MARSCHALL included documents that stated the substances can “crush …. viral infections including those in the Corona family, like in China Corona-19.”The charges contained in the complaint are only allegations.  A person is presumed innocent unless and until he or she is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.In 2011 and again in 2017, MARSCHALL was convicted and sentenced in federal court for distributing misbranded drugs.  Due to these prior convictions, MARSCHALL faces increased penalties for introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce -- up to three years in prison and a $10,000 fine.  In 2018, the Washington State Department of Health permanently revoked his credential to practice as a naturopath.The case is being investigated by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigation (FDA-OCI).  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Brian Werner who serves as the COVID-19 Fraud Coordinator for the U.S. Attorney’s Office.marschall_complaint_4-29-20.pdfAttachment(s):Download marschall_complaint_4-29-20.pdfTopic(s):CoronavirusConsumer ProtectionCyber CrimeHealth Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - Washington, WesternContact:Press contact for the U.S. Attorney’s Office is Communications Director Emily Langlie at (206) 553-4110 orEmily.Langlie@usdoj.gov."

        "content": "Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, April 29, 2020A federal court in Utah has entered an injunction halting the sale of a fraudulent coronavirus (COVID-19) treatment, the Department of Justice announced today.In response to a civil complaint and accompanying court papers filed on April 27, 2020, in Salt Lake City, the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah issued a temporary restraining order against defendants Gordon Pedersen of Cedar Hills, Utah, and his companies, My Doctor Suggests LLC and GP Silver LLC.  The civil complaint alleges that the defendants are fraudulently promoting and selling various silver products for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.  The court’s order temporarily enjoins the defendants from continuing to sell or distribute their silver products for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disease, including COVID-19.  A separate court order temporarily freezes defendants’ assets in order to preserve the court’s ability to grant effective final relief and to maintain the status quo.  A hearing on the government’s request for a preliminary injunction is set for May 12, 2020.“The Department of Justice will take swift action to protect consumers from those who would recklessly exploit this public health crisis by offering phony cure-alls for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division.  “We work closely with our partners at the Food and Drug Administration and will move quickly to shut down schemes that promote and sell unlawful products during this pandemic.”“Even in a time of great uncertainty, there are at least two unchanging realities.  There are those who would unlawfully exploit our vulnerabilities, and there are those who will hold such parties accountable,” said U.S. Attorney John W. Huber for the District of Utah.  “COVID-19 is a dangerous disease, and American consumers must have accurate and reliable information as they make important health decisions.”The complaint alleges that, beginning in early 2020, the defendants conducted a scheme to defraud consumers throughout the United States, promoting and selling silver products based on fraudulent claims of protection against, and treatment for, COVID-19.  According to the complaint, the defendants have made a wide variety of false and misleading claims touting silver products as a preventative for COVID-19, including that having silver in the bloodstream will “usher” any coronavirus out of the body and that “it has been proven that Alkaline Structured Silver will destroy all forms of viruses, it will protect people from the Coronavirus.”  Additionally, the defendants assert that once in the blood stream, silver nanoparticles can block the virus from attaching to their cells, and thus “prevent [] the disease totally and completely.”“The FDA will continue to help ensure those who place profits above the public health during the COVID-19 pandemic are stopped,” said Judy McMeekin, Pharm.D., Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs, U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  “We are fully committed to working with the Department of Justice to take appropriate action against those jeopardizing the health of Americans by offering and distributing products with unproven claims to prevent or treat COVID-19.”The enforcement action filed today is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Speare I. Hodges and Sarah Williams of the Department of Justice, Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorney Joel A. Ferre of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Utah, with support from FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations and Office of the Chief Counsel.The claims made in the complaint are allegations that, if the case were to proceed to trial, the government must prove to receive a permanent injunction against the defendants.Additional information about the Consumer Protection Branch and its enforcement efforts may be found atwww.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch.  For more information about the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Utah, visit its website athttps://www.justice.gov/usao-ut.  For information about the Department of Justice’s efforts to stop illegal COVID-19-related activity, visitwww.justice.gov/coronavirus.  For the most up-to-date information on COVID-19, consumers may visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO websites.The public is urged to report suspected fraud schemes related to COVID-19 (the Coronavirus) by calling the National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF) hotline (1-866-720-5721) or by e-mailing the NCDF atdisaster@leo.gov.Topic(s):CoronavirusComponent(s):Civil DivisionUSAO - UtahPress Release Number:20-407"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeNorthern District of TexasFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, April 24, 2020A federal court entered a permanent injunction halting a purported “ozone therapy” center in Dallas from offering unproven treatments for COVID-19, U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox announced today.In a civil case filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, the government alleged that the defendants, Purity Health & Wellness Centers and one of the firm’s principals, Jean Juanita Allen, fraudulently promoted so-called ozone therapy as a treatment for COVID-19.The defendants agreed to be bound by a permanent injunction barring them from representing that ozone could be used to treat or cure COVID-19. The order was entered Friday morning by U.S. District Judge Sam A. Lindsay.“This defendant preyed on public fear, peddling bogus treatments that had absolutely no effect against COVID-19,” said U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas Erin Nealy Cox.  “As we’ve said in past COVID-19 civil cases: The Department of Justice will not permit anyone to exploit a pandemic for personal gain.”“The Department of Justice will not stand by and permit the fraudulent promotion of supposed COVID-19 treatments that do no good and that could be harmful,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.  “We are working with law enforcement and agency partners to stop those who attempt to profit by selling useless products during this pandemic.”According to court filings, Ms. Allen told a caller posing as a potential customer that although ozone could be dangerous, Purity’s treatment was safe even for children, would sanitize anything, and would eradicate viral or bacterial infections.The court filings alleged that Ms. Allen claimed Purity’s ozone treatments – which she asserted would increase oxygen in the blood, making it impossible for viruses to manifest – were 95 percent effective even for someone who had tested positive for COVID-19.  She claimed a team of “doctors” had recommended an “ozone steam sauna” for someone with COVID-19.On Instagram, Purity Health & Wellness claimed ozone was the “only prevention” for COVID-19 and insisted the treatment could “eradicate” the virus.  The center also claimed ozone could combat other deadly diseases, including cancer, SARS, and Ebola.“We will not allow anyone to illegally profit by exploiting the fear and anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Matthew J. DeSarno.  “The FBI and our partners are working together every day to prevent, detect, and dismantle COVID-19 fraud.”“The FDA will continue to help ensure those who place profits above the public health during the COVID-19 pandemic are stopped,” said Stacy Amin, Food and Drug Administration Chief Counsel.  “We are fully committed to working with the Department of Justice to take appropriate action against those jeopardizing the health of Americans with unproven treatments.”The enforcement action was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Patrick Runkle of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorney Kenneth Coffin of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Fabio Leonardi is the COVID-19 Fraud Coordinator for the Northern District of Texas.  The case was investigated by the FBI’s Dallas Field Office and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations.The claims made in the complaint are allegations that the United States would have had to prove if the case had proceeded to trial.For information about the Department of Justice’s efforts to stop illegal COVID-19-related activity, visitwww.justice.gov/coronavirusorhttps://www.justice.gov/usao-ndtx/report-covid-19-fraud.Topic(s):CoronavirusComponent(s):Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)USAO - Texas, NorthernContact:Erin Dooley, Public Affairs Officer 214-659-8707erin.dooley@usdoj.gov"

        "content": "Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASETuesday, April 21, 2020Southern California-Based Company Agrees to Pay Largest-Ever Fine in a Food Safety Case and Implement a Comprehensive Food Safety Compliance ProgramLOS ANGELES – Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. has agreed to pay a $25 million criminal fine and institute a comprehensive food safety program to resolve criminal charges that it adulterated food that sickened more than 1,100 people across the United States from 2015 to 2018.The Justice Department today charged the Newport Beach-based Chipotle with two counts of violating the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by adulterating food while held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce.In conjunction with the criminal information filed in United States District Court in Los Angeles, prosecutors also filed a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) in which Chipotle agreed to pay $25 million – the largest fine ever imposed in a food safety case.The criminal charges stem, in part, from incidents related to outbreaks in Chipotle restaurants of norovirus, a highly contagious pathogen that can be easily transmitted by infected food workers handling ready-to-eat foods and their ingredients. Norovirus can cause severe symptoms, including diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal cramping.“Chipotle failed to ensure that its employees both understood and complied with its food safety protocols, resulting in hundreds of customers across the country getting sick,” said United States Attorney Nick Hanna.“Today’s steep penalty, coupled with the tens of millions of dollars Chipotle already has spent to upgrade its food safety program since 2015, should result in greater protections for Chipotle customers and remind others in the industry to review and improve their own health and safety practices.”“This case highlights why it is important for restaurants and members of the food services industry to ensure that managers and employees consistently follow food safety policies,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. “The Department of Justice will vigorously enforce food safety laws in order to protect public health.”“The FDA will hold food companies accountable when they endanger the public’s health by purveying adulterated food that causes outbreaks of illness,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice any company whose food products present a health hazard to consumers.”As the company admitted in the DPA: “From approximately 2015 to 2018, Chipotle faced at least five food safety incidents at various restaurants around the country, which stemmed primarily from store-level employees’ failure to follow Chipotle’s food safety policies and procedures, including the policy requiring the exclusion of restaurant employees who were sick or recently had been sick, as well as a failure by restaurant employees to hold food at appropriate temperatures to prevent and control for the growth of foodborne pathogens.” These incidents primarily stemmed from store-level employees’ failure to follow company food safety protocols at company-owned restaurants in Los Angeles; Simi Valley, California; Boston; Sterling, Virginia; and Powell, Ohio.In August 2015, 234 consumers and employees of a Chipotle restaurant in Simi Valley reported becoming ill. On August 19, 2015, an employee of that restaurant was sent home because he vomited. Although company policies required the restaurant to report such illnesses to Chipotle safety officials and to implement food safety procedures, the restaurant did not do so until two days afterward – and only after multiple consumers reported illnesses.In December 2015, over the course of nine days, 141 people reported illness related to a norovirus incident at a Chipotle restaurant in Boston, most likely the result of an ill employee who was ordered to continue working after vomiting inside the restaurant – a clear violation of company policy. Two days later, the apprentice manager returned to work and helped package a catering order for a Boston College basketball team, whose members were among the consumers sickened by the outbreak.In July 2018, over the course of at least eight days, approximately 647 people who dined at a Chipotle restaurant in Powell, Ohio reported illness related to Clostridium perfringens, a bacteria that grows rapidly when food is not held at appropriate temperatures. The local health department determined that the restaurant had critical violations of the local food regulations, including those specific to time and temperature controls for lettuce and beans.Some Chipotle employees reported stressful working conditions, as well as inadequate staffing and training opportunities, according to the DPA. During the period from 2015 to 2018, store-level Chipotle employees, many of whom were teenagers and young adults, felt that they could not stay at home when they were sick. Due to the pressure of not wanting to let their teammates down, or of finding people to cover their work shifts, these employees reported feeling pressure to work while sick, even though this was against Chipotle’s sick-exclusion policies.In the DPA, Chipotle also agreed to develop and follow a comprehensive food safety compliance program. As part of this program, Chipotle will work with its Food Safety Council to evaluate, among other things, the company’s food safety audits, restaurant staffing and employee training to mitigate the issues that led to the outbreaks from 2015 to 2018. If the company complies with the deferred prosecution agreement for three years, the government will move to dismiss the criminal information.This matter was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations.This case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Joseph O. Johns, Chief of the Environmental and Community Safety Crimes Section; Assistant United States Attorney Mark A. Williams and Special Assistant United States Attorney Sonia W. Nath, both of the Environmental and Community Safety Crimes Section; and Trial Attorney Daniel E.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeEastern District of VirginiaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, April 17, 2020ALEXANDRIA, Va. – A Nebraska pharmacist was arrested today on charges related to an alleged conspiracy to use explosives, specifically Molotov cocktails, to firebomb and destroy a competitor pharmacy.According to court documents, Hyrum T. Wilson, 41, of Auburn, told an alleged co-conspirator: “This is the last shipment he will get from me as long as the other pharmacy is still standing.”Wilson allegedly supplied thousands of prescription pills, including opioids, from his business, Hyrum’s Family Value Pharmacy, to William Anderson Burgamy IV. Burgamy allegedly operated as the Darknet vendor NeverPressedRX (NPRX) from August 2019 through April 2020, and had thousands of illegal recorded sales on a major Darknet market. Burgamy was charged in the Eastern District of Virginia last week and ordered detained. The firebombing plot was uncovered through search warrants that were executed following Burgamy’s arrest.According to court documents, Wilson conspired with Burgamy to conduct a firebombing of another pharmacy in Auburn, Nebraska. The goal of the plot was to destroy Wilson’s local competition, which Wilson and Burgamy allegedly believed would increase the volume of prescription drugs that Wilson’s business could obtain, thereby allowing Wilson and Burgamy’s drug trafficking operation to continue and expand. Wilson and Burgamy allegedly agreed that the plot, named “Operation Firewood,” would involve the use of Molotov cocktails to burn down the victim pharmacy, and that Burgamy would carry numerous firearms during the attack.Wilson allegedly created “getaway” maps and routes for Burgamy to use to help him evade law enforcement detection following the intended firebombing. Wilson also suggested that Burgamy steal prescription medications from the victim pharmacy before setting it on fire, and Burgamy offered to share with Wilson the profits from any stolen drugs.Wilson is charged with conspiracy to use fire and explosives, conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, and a firearms-related offense. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, April 16, 2020SAN DIEGO – Dr. Jennings Ryan Staley, a licensed physician and the operator of Skinny Beach Med Spa in San Diego, was charged today with mail fraud in connection with the sale of what he described as a “100%” cure for COVID-19 that he said would render customers immune to the virus for at least six weeks. Staley is scheduled to be arraigned in federal court tomorrow at 2 p.m. before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jill L. Burkhardt.FBI Agents began investigating this COVID-19 related fraud immediately upon receiving a tip from the public and shortly thereafter introduced an undercover agent. Today, FBI agents also executed a search warrant at the business of Skinny Beach Med Spa located in Carmel Valley.  As alleged in the criminal complaint, Skinny Beach Med Spa, based in Carmel Valley, offered a range of beauty-related services such as Botox, hair removal, and fat transfer. In late March, Skinny Beach began sending emails advertising “COVID-19 treatment packs,” described as a “concierge medicine experience” priced at $3,995 for a family of four, that included among other things access to Dr. Staley, the medications hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, and “anti-anxiety treatments to help you avoid panic if needed and help you sleep.” In a recorded call in which Dr. Staley was selling his services to a would-be customer – in fact, the undercover FBI agent – Dr. Staley described the medication he was offering as “an amazing cure” and a “miracle cure” that would cure COVID-19 “100%.” He added that if you take the medication without having the disease, “you’re immune for at least 6 weeks.” Staley referred to medication he offered as a “magic bullet,” and said, “It’s preventative and curative. It’s hard to believe, it’s almost too good to be true. But it’s a remarkable clinical phenomenon.” Staley also stated, “I’ve never seen anything like this in medicine, just so you know. Really, I can’t think of anything. That, you’ve got a disease that literally disappears in hours.”Dr. Staley was interviewed a week later by the FBI as part of the overt investigation. When Dr. Staley was asked by agents whether Skinny Beach has told patients that the treatments are a 100% effective cure for COVID-19, Dr. Staley said, “No, that would be foolish. We would never say anything like that.” He also told the FBI that it was “not definitive” that the medication he offered cures COVID-19.As set out in the complaint, Dr. Staley also offered the would-be customer Xanax (alprazolam) – a Schedule IV controlled substance – as part of his concierge package and shipped the drug without conducting any sort of medical examination. He claimed that his broker was smuggling hydroxychloroquine from China to make his own pills and had concealed the shipment from customs authorities by describing it as sweet potato extract.  Shipping records confirmed that Dr. Staley was indeed importing a shipment of “yam extract,” scheduled to arrive in the U.S. in a matter of days.“We will not tolerate COVID-19 fraudsters who try to profit and take advantage of the pandemic fear to cheat, steal and harm others,” said U.S. Attorney Brewer. “Rest assured: those who engage in this despicable conduct will find themselves in the crosshairs of federal prosecutors.”“The sale of false cures, especially by a medical professional, will be vigorously investigated by the FBI,” said Omer Meisel, the Acting Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s San Diego Field Office. “The FBI is using a variety of tools to identify anyone who exploits the current crisis with fraudulent scams or a variety of cyber schemes – and is proactively warning the public about products claiming to save lives, before losing their money or creating false hope. Scammers seeking to profit by exploiting fear and uncertainty during this COVID-19 pandemic will be brought to justice.”“The FDA will continue to collaborate with our fellow law enforcement partners to bring to justice those who place profits above the public health during the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Special Agent in Charge Lisa L. Malinowski, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office. “Today’s announcement should serve as a reminder that we will take appropriate action against bad actors who take advantage of a crisis while jeopardizing the health of Americans.”The FBI continues to warn the public about health care fraud schemes:https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-warns-of-emerging-health-care-fraud-schemes-related-to-covid-19-pandemicand other COVID-19 related crimes at:https://www.fbi.gov/coronavirus.If you think you are a victim of COVID-19 fraud, immediately report it the FBI (visit ic3.gov, tips.fbi.gov, or call 1-800-CALL-FBI or the San Diego FBI at 858-320-1800.In addition, the public is urged to report suspected fraud schemes related to COVID-19 by calling the National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF) hotline (1-866-720-5721) or by e-mailing the NCDF atdisaster@leo.gov.DEFENDANTSCase Number 20-mj-1407Jennings Ryan Staley                                     Age: 44                                   San Diego, CASUMMARY OF CHARGESTitle 18, United States Code, section 1341 (mail fraud)Maximum penalty: 20 years in prison; fine; penalty assessmentAGENCYFederal Bureau of InvestigationU.S. Food and Drug Administration*The charges and allegations contained in an indictment or complaint are merely accusations, and the defendants are considered innocent unless and until proven guilty.COVID-19 Concierge Medicine Pack (Criminal Complaint, Case No. 20-mj-1407, p. 9)Topic(s):Health Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - California, SouthernContact:Assistant U.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeEastern District of VirginiaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, April 9, 2020ALEXANDRIA, Va. – A Maryland man was arrested today on charges related to his alleged unlawful distribution of medications through the Darknet, and money laundering involving Bitcoin.According to court documents, William Anderson Burgamy IV, 32, of Hanover, recently posted on his Darknet market vendor page: “Even with Corona Virus [sic] the shop is running at full speed.”“I want to offer thanks and praise to our local law enforcement partners for moving forward with this public safety investigation amidst the COVID-19 pandemic,” said G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. “The selflessness and bravery being exercised by our law enforcement partners every day, but especially now, deserves broad public recognition and thanks.”Burgamy, who is not a pharmacist, has allegedly illegally operated as the Darknet vendor NeverPressedRX (NPRX) since at least August 2019. The NPRX vendor store claimed to sell authentic medications, including prescription opioids, sourced from United States pharmacies. NPRX had thousands of recorded sales on a major Darknet market. Burgamy allegedly laundered the proceeds of his criminal activity by cashing out his Bitcoin cryptocurrency drug payments into United States dollars and moving the funds through a variety of accounts, including his business bank accounts, in an effort to conceal and disguise the nature and source of his illicit proceeds.According to court documents, law enforcement, in coordination with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, conducted online undercover operations targeting NPRX. Since January, undercover federal agents made numerous purchases of medications, including prescription opioids, from Burgamy’s NPRX Darknet account. After identifying Burgamy, investigators surveilled him as he conducted numerous trips to local post offices, where he allegedly mailed prescription drugs to various Darknet buyers, including to the undercover federal agents in the Eastern District of Virginia.During the execution of a search warrant inside Burgamy’s residence, law enforcement discovered what appeared to be thousands of prescription opioid pills and at least eight firearms, including two loaded AR-15 assault rifles.Burgamy is charged with distribution of controlled substances and money laundering, and faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison if convicted.

        "content": "Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASETuesday, April 7, 2020Company Shipped Medical Devices Without Approved Instructions for Use and Failed to File FDA-Required Adverse Event Reports of Serious InfectionsPentax Medical Company will pay $43 million to resolve criminal charges based on the company’s shipment of four types of endoscopes for 18 months without FDA-cleared instructions for use and the company’s failure to file timely reports of two infections associated with its endoscopes, the Department of Justice announced today.Pentax was charged in a criminal complaint filed today in Newark federal court with distributing misbranded medical devices in interstate commerce in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA).  Pentax has entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) that will allow it to avoid conviction if it complies with the reform and enhanced compliance requirements outlined in the agreement.  As a result of the conduct outlined in the criminal complaint, Pentax has agreed to pay a $40 million criminal fine and to forfeit $3 million.“In carrying out its responsibilities to protect the health and safety of patients treated with medical devices, the FDA relies on manufacturers to provide health care professionals with the correct, approved or cleared instructions for safe use of the devices, and to report promptly to the FDA potential product safety issues,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division.  “Pentax’s failure to follow important safety requirements is serious and warrants the significant penalties imposed as part of this resolution.”“Pentax made a decision to ignore the cleared instructions for use of its endoscopes, believing that doing so would increase its sales, putting profits over patient safety,” said U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito for the District of New Jersey.  “In doing so, and by failing to report to the FDA certain adverse events relating to those endoscopes, it broke the law, jeopardized the health of patients, and, ultimately, cost itself $43 million on fines and forfeiture.”The criminal complaint against Pentax, which Pentax agrees is true, charges that Pentax made a deliberate business decision not to use revised FDA-cleared instructions for cleaning its endoscopes because Pentax feared the new instructions would cause it to lose business.  Endoscopes are reusable devices that must be cleaned after each use or else infectious material may remain and be transmitted to subsequent patients.  In 2014, the FDA told Pentax to revise its existing cleaning instructions for four types of endoscopes and add cleaning steps.  Pentax agreed, and FDA cleared, revised cleaning instructions in April 2014.  Pentax was then required to include these revised cleaning instructions when it shipped those four endoscopes.Instead, for the next 18 months, Pentax shipped the four types of endoscopes with the old instructions for use – not the newly enhanced, FDA-cleared cleaning instructions.  Pentax decided not to use the enhanced cleaning instructions because they required customers to spend more time cleaning the endoscopes.  One internal email warned that the increase of cleaning time from five minutes to 25 minutes would be “catastrophic,” and another predicted that customers “will be very upset and could switch away from PENTAX because of the extra time, manpower, and cost to perform the new protocol.”Pentax continued shipping the four types of endoscopes without the FDA-cleared cleaning instructions until September 2015.  At that time, Pentax started including FDA-cleared instructions for two of the endoscopes and newly validated cleaning instructions for the other two types of endoscopes.  Pentax made $18 million in gross profits from selling the four types endoscopes during this 18-month period.Pentax was also charged with and admitted failing to file timely reports of two infection incidents associated with its endoscope.  To enable FDA and others to identify and monitor adverse events, the FDCA requires medical device manufacturers to file adverse event reports – known as Medical Device Reports (MDRs) – within 30 days of becoming aware of information that reasonably suggests that the manufacturer’s device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury.In June 2013, Pentax learned that four patients at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Chicago were infected with drug-resistant bacteria after being treated with the same Pentax endoscope.  Pentax failed to file MDRs within 30 days because its employees did not understand the reporting requirements.  Pentax filed an MDR about the Advocate Lutheran infections in late September 2013.In late June 2014, Pentax learned that four patients at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston were infected with Escherichia coli bacteria after being treated with the same Pentax endoscope.  Pentax also failed to file MDRs about this incident within 30 days because its employees misunderstood the reporting requirements.  Pentax filed an MDR about the infections at Massachusetts General Hospital in December 2014.“Americans expect and deserve that the medical devices used on them are safe, effective, and properly labeled with accurate information.  When companies subvert FDA’s standards and requirements, they place unsuspecting patients at risk,” said Catherine A. Hermsen, Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations.  “FDA will continue to investigate and help bring to justice companies that jeopardize the public health by distributing misbranded products.”As part of the DPA, Pentax has agreed to, among other actions, conduct a thorough audit of its current instructions for use for endoscopic devices and MDR procedures to determine their compliance with FDA requirements and report to the FDA in writing.  It has agreed to enhance its compliance training and maintain an effective compliance program.  Pentax’s president and the president of the Lifecare Division of Pentax’s parent, Hoya Corporation, must annually certify that Pentax took the compliance measures required by the DPA, and Hoya’s board of directors must certify annually that Pentax’s compliance program is effective.The investigation was conducted by special agents from the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey J.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of MassachusettsFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, January 23, 2020Defendant sentenced for his role in bribing practitioners to prescribe highly addictive pain medication, often when medically unnecessaryBOSTON – The founder of Insys Therapeutics, John Kapoor, was sentenced today in federal court in Boston for orchestrating a scheme to bribe practitioners to prescribe Subsys, a fentanyl-based pain medication, often when medically unnecessary.John Kapoor, 76, of Phoenix, Ariz., was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs to 66 months in prison, three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay forfeiture and restitution to be determined at a later date. The government recommended a sentence of 15 years in prison.In May 2019, Kapoor was convicted by a federal jury of racketeering conspiracy along with four other Insys executives.As a veteran of the pharmaceutical industry, Kapoor learned that he could profit from developing a spray delivery system for a generic drug, then marketing it as a premium product. Kapoor privately funded Insys as it developed Subsys, which was eventually approved to treat cancer patients suffering intense breakthrough pain. With such significant personal financial investment, Kapoor was committed to ensuring that Insys was successful, and he did so by exercising tight control on all aspects of corporate decision making. Kapoor hired, or authorized the hiring of, several top executives who became co-conspirators in the criminal scheme to bribe practitioners, many of whom operated pain clinics, to prescribe Subsys to patients, often when medically unnecessaryIn 2012, Kapoor authorized the use of “speaker programs” purportedly intended to increase brand awareness of Subsys through peer-to-peer educational lunches and dinners. However, the programs were used as a vehicle to pay bribes and kickbacks to targeted practitioners in exchange for increased Subsys prescriptions and increased dosage. Kapoor insisted that profits generated should double the amount of money spent paying doctors. In October 2012, Kapoor instructed the Vice President of Marketing to calculate the return on investment (ROI) for each speaker to determine if the speaker had a “positive ROI.” Practitioners who failed to meet satisfactory prescribing requirements were ousted from the speaker program. Kapoor approved bribing doctors that he knew abusively prescribed opioids.Kapoor controlled and enforced the criminal scheme on a daily basis during a morning meeting, referred to as the “8:30 call,” which also involved many of his co-defendants. One of the topics discussed was the scheme to bribe doctors. Kapoor routinely discussed the suitability of additional funds, and which doctors were writing prescriptions for Subsys or a competitive drug.Kapoor knew that the success of Insys depended on insurers approving payment for Subsys. In October 2012, Kapoor approved the creation of a pilot program, the “Insys Reimbursement Center” (IRC), which was dedicated to obtaining prior authorization for payment directly from insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. To do so, employees of the IRC posed as employees of the practitioner and used a script of false and misleading representations about patient diagnoses in order to secure approval for the drug by the insurance provider. For example, since insurers were more likely to authorize payment for Subsys if a patient was being treated for cancer-related pain, IRC employees were instructed to mislead insurers regarding the true diagnosis of the patient. Kapoor approved these tactics, and demanded a 100% success rate.“Out of pure greed, Insys executives, from John Kapoor on down, bribed doctors to prescribe this powerful and highly addictive narcotic to people who did not need it.  Despite increasing public fears of a drug epidemic fueled by pain pill prescriptions, these defendants, led by Kapoor, ploughed ahead, setting weekly quotas for doctors on their payroll, urging them to prescribe Subsys in higher and higher doses, all so they could make millions of dollars at patients’ expense.  Their disregard for the public’s health and safety is nothing short of appalling.  This case is not only about punishing these defendants.  It is also about making the next pharmaceutical company think twice about its sales tactics and the basic corporate responsibility to not victimize the public,” said United States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling.  “This was a landmark prosecution that successfully held accountable a pharmaceutical company’s top executives for their roles in the illicit marketing and prescribing of opioids.”“John Kapoor and his loyal lieutenants minimized their actions and distanced themselves from the harm they were committing on patients whose lives they ultimately ruined, and now all of them are finally being held accountable for their criminal conduct,” said Joseph R. Bonavolonta, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Boston Division. “Their downfall illustrates the FBI’s commitment to attacking the ongoing opioid crisis from every angle, and we will continue to identify and dismantle criminal enterprises like this one to ensure those who are responsible for patient care are taking care of patients, and not themselves.”“These sentences undoubtedly send a clear message to health care executives relying on illegal schemes to increase profits: they will be held accountable for corporate crimes. The reckless and dangerous violation of law by these pharmaceutical executives is extremely serious, and we will not tolerate those who put profits above the well-being of patients. We will continue to attack the opioid crisis from all angles, including holding the pharmaceutical industry and its leadership accountable,” said Phillip Coyne, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General.“The FDA continues to respond forcefully to the ongoing opioid epidemic – one of the largest public health tragedies our country has faced – by ensuring the safe and appropriate use of these powerful medications. But bribing healthcare providers to prescribe this most powerful type of opioid – an immediate release form of fentanyl – is not only unacceptable, it puts patients at serious risk of overdose and potentially death,” said Judith McMeekin, Acting Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “This conduct cannot be tolerated, and the FDA remains fully committed to working with our law enforcement partners to bring to justice those who place profits before the public’s health.”“The reckless actions by this executive whose product included controlled medications increased the potential for diversion and addiction, which jeopardizes the public health and safety,” said Drug Enforcement Administration Special Agent in Charge Brian D. Boyle.  “DEA pledges to work with our law enforcement and regulatory partners to ensure that rules and regulations are followed.”“Ensuring the integrity of TRICARE and combatting the dangers posed to military members and their dependents by improperly prescribed opioids are top priorities for the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS),” stated Leigh-Alistair Barzey, Special Agent in Charge of the DCIS Northeast Field Office. “Today's sentencing marks the successful conclusion of this investigation and demonstrates the DCIS’ ongoing commitment to work with its law enforcement partners and the USAO-MA to identify, investigate and prosecute individuals and pharmaceutical companies that seek to fraudulently profit at the expense of patients.”“John Kapoor and the other executives in this case criminally conspired to place profits before patients, all to drive sales of a highly potent and addictive opioid. The prosecution of these pharmaceutical executives demonstrates that healthcare fraud will not be tolerated.  The Employee Benefits Security Administration will continue collaborating with our law enforcement partners in these important investigations to protect participants in private sector health plans, detect and deter health care fraud, and contribute to fighting the opioid epidemic,” said Carol S. Hamilton, Acting Regional Director of the U.S. Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security Administration, Boston Regional Office.“Today’s sentence is the result of a coordinated investigation by law enforcement agencies who are committed to ending the nation’s opioid crisis,” said Inspector in Charge Joseph W. Cronin of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service’s Boston Division. “Insys Therapeutics executives profited by offering bribes and kickbacks in exchange for prescriptions of a highly addictive fentanyl spray. These practices put the health of the American public at risk and jeopardized the integrity of our mail system.”“The defendants in this investigation put the company’s bottom line before the welfare of the patients who were in need of genuine care,” said Matt M. Modafferi, Special Agent in Charge of U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General. “The sentences imposed on the defendants will serve as a reminder that there are severe consequences when individuals and companies use these types of tactics in order to drive up their pharmaceutical sales. I commend the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their tireless efforts leading up to and through the successful ten-week trial of the defendants.”“These sentences not only hold the defendants accountable, they demonstrate the ongoing commitment of VA OIG to ensure the safety and integrity of VA healthcare programs.  VA OIG and its law enforcement partners will continue to vigorously investigate healthcare fraud at VA and hold accountable anyone who puts the well-being of veterans, their dependents, or the public at risk,” said Acting SAC Jeff Stachowiak.Thomas W. South, Deputy Assistant Inspector General for Investigations, OPM OIG said: “There is no doubt that the unscrupulous practices of Insys Therapeutics and its founder John Kapoor have fueled the devastating national opioid epidemic. We are incredibly proud to have been a part of this groundbreaking case and I applaud the exceptional work of our investigators and law enforcement partners. Bribing physicians across the country to overprescribe Subsys risked the lives of thousands of patients and today’s sentencing is an important step toward accountability and justice.”Assistant U.S. Attorneys K.

He was told that HOPE Clinic specialized in the treatment of chronic pain through opioids but Lowry had no experience in pain management. Despite having no experience in pain management, Lowry agreed to work at the Charleston HOPE Clinic location. Lowry travelled from North Carolina to West Virginia the day before he was scheduled to work and stayed at a hotel for the week. When Lowry started working at the HOPE Clinic, it became apparent to him that customers were not being properly evaluated prior to receiving prescriptions for opioids. Lowry also realized that customer’s files were poorly kept with little relevant medical information in them. Most customers paid in cash and many travelled from out of state to the HOPE Clinic.Lowry often received a bonus on top of his hourly pay that was clearly based on the number of paying customers at the HOPE Clinic. Despite all of these red flags, Lowry continued to travel from North Carolina to work at the HOPE Clinic in Charleston, West Virginia, and he continued to write customers prescriptions for Schedule II narcotics. Lowry specifically admitted that he travelled to from North Carolina to Charleston, West Virginia on June 15, 2014, to work at the Charleston HOPE Clinic from June 16-18, 2014. During this trip, Lowry admitted to prescribing customer D.J.B. 120 Percocet 10/325 mg pills and 60 Oxycodone 10 mg pills without a legitimate medical purpose in the usual course of professional medical practice and beyond the bounds of medical practice.Lowry faces up to 5 years in prison when sentenced on May 4, 2020.The investigation was conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG), the Internal Revenue Service – Criminal Investigations, the Food and Drug Administration – Office of Criminal Investigations, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the West Virginia State Police, the Kentucky State Police, the Beckley Police Department, the Virginia State Police, the Charleston Police Department, and the Drug Enforcement Administration.United States District Judge Volk presided over the hearing.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeCentral District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, April1, 2020LOS ANGELES– A British man was named today in a federal criminal complaint that charges him with smuggling into the United States mislabeled drugs purported to be a treatment for those suffering from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.Frank Richard Ludlow, 59, of West Sussex, United Kingdom, was charged with one count of introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce, a felony offense that carries a statutory maximum sentence of three years in federal prison.According to an affidavit filed with the complaint, beginning on March 1, as the coronavirus global health crisis worsened, Ludlow repackaged preexisting “Trinity Remedy” kits as “Trinity COVID-19 SARS Antipathogenic Treatment” kits, even though the kits had not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat COVID-19 – or for any other use.Every major health authority has warned that there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 and no vaccine to prevent coronavirus infection. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior FDA approval.“Hucksters who hawk ‘treatments’ for this deadly disease put consumers’ lives at risk by peddling unapproved drugs,” said United States Attorney Nick Hanna. “We are aggressively investigating all types of criminal activity associated with the current health emergency, and anyone attempting to cheat the public during this time will face severe penalties.”“The FDA is actively and aggressively monitoring for unproven COVID-19 products including those attempting to be imported into the country— as part of our ongoing efforts to protect Americans during this pandemic. Unproven health claims, tests, and medical products can pose serious health risks and may keep people from seeking care or delay necessary medical treatment,” said Catherine A. Hermsen, Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations. “The FDA will continue to take appropriate action to protect consumers from bad actors who take advantage of a pandemic to increase their profits while jeopardizing the public health.”“Drugs and medical devices are strictly regulated in order to protect the American consumer,” said David A. Prince, Special Agent in Charge for Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Los Angeles. “Individuals who circumvent those regulations potentially expose patients to unsafe products that could cause serious harm. HSI will continue to target those whose actions put the health and safety of our citizens at risk.”Ludlow, who is not a doctor, allegedly smuggled the kits from the United Kingdom to the United States by shipping mislabeled parcels containing the kits to individuals in California and Utah. Ludlow’s business relationship with his Utah connection dates back to May 2017 when he sold her “Trinity Remedy,” a “miracle cure” for her severe medical issues, the affidavit states.This “cure” – later rebranded as “Trinity Mind, Body & Soul” – allegedly contained vitamin C, an enzyme mix, potassium thiocyanate, and hydrogen peroxide. Consumers were instructed to add 18 ounces of water, say a prayer, drink half of the solution, take a probiotic along with bee pollen, and then ingest the remainder of the solution, according to the affidavit.Between May 2017 and March 2020, Ludlow sold his Utah connection between 300 and 400 of these “treatments” for $50 per kit, many of which she gave away, but some of which she sold for as much as $200, the affidavit states.In February or March of 2020, Ludlow began selling kits named “Trinity COVID-19 SARS Antipathogenic Treatment,” and these kits had the same ingredients as “Trinity Mind, Body & Soul,” according to court documents. Ludlow allegedly shipped the kits from the United Kingdom to Ogden, Utah and to the Forestville, California home of the Utah woman’s boyfriend. Ludlow allegedly also shipped kits to the Draper, Utah home of his Utah connection’s parents. Federal law enforcement intercepted the kits before they reached their intended destinations.On March 23, British law enforcement arrested Ludlow and charged him with violating drug laws. He remains in custody in the U.K.This matter was investigated jointly by the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations and Homeland Security Investigations, with assistance from U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the United States Postal Inspection Service.This case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Matthew W.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeEastern District of TennesseeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, March 11, 2020Chattanooga, Tenn. –  All five defendants have been convicted in federal court for their roles in a scheme defrauding both private insurance companies and government insurance programs of over $30 million dollars.  The scheme involved sham prescriptions for compounded creams and medications, oftentimes issued without the supposed patient even knowing about them, and were frequently signed by a health care provider who never even met the patient.Jerry Wayne Wilkerson, 40, Michael Chatfield, 31, Kasey Nicholson, 34, Billy Hindmon, 39, and Jayson Montgomery, 40, were convicted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee at Chattanooga.  The Honorable Harry S. Mattice, Jr. presided over the trial and scheduled sentencing for all five individuals for June 8, 2020.The charges of healthcare fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, illegal kickbacks, and money laundering in the 178-count indictment centered on a scheme in which the defendants marketed topical creams and other medications through prescription drug coverage plans that paid for the creams and medications.  The creams were compounded by a pharmacy, meaning they were supposed to have been uniquely formulated specifically for the needs of an individual patient, thus justifying the exorbitant cost- sometimes more than $15,000 per tube. However, the proof at trial showed there was nothing unique about these creams, and in fact the prescription forms were usually pre-printed documents filled out in mass by the marketers.  A health care provider’s signature was oftentimes stamped on the document by employees of the defendants.  The defendants all profited from the fraud, including the pocketing of millions of dollars of kickbacks from prescriptions billed to Tricare, which is the government-funded health insurance program for active duty and retired military servicemen and women.The four-year investigation revealed that the defendants used a network of in-person marketing by convincing friends and family members to sign up for revolving shipments of exorbitantly priced topical creams and medications, some prescribed without seeing a physician or others which were not medically necessary. The majority of the time, these medications were neither needed nor wanted by the named patient but were ordered strictly for monetary gain.  On some occasions, orders were placed without the knowledge or approval of the patient, and their insurance would then be billed for these items. The proof at trial showed that Wilkerson collected at least $13 million in commissions from the scheme.Insurance companies and Tricare paid a total of roughly $35 million for the compounded medications in this case.“Fraud such as this affects everyone.  It increases what we all pay for healthcare and prescription drugs. Scam artists put their own financial interests ahead of the safety of others and ignore instituted laws, which protect the taxpayer and our funded healthcare system,” said U.S. Attorney J. Douglas Overbey.  “Worse, much of the fraud in this case was directed at Tricare, the government program which insures our active duty and retired military personnel.   The Hamilton County School System, a self-insured system funded by the taxpayers of Hamilton County, was also defrauded of over $950,000.  When people steal from the taxpayers, they steal from all of us.”“A key aspect of the FDA’s mission to protect the public health is creating a regulatory framework that helps ensure that compounded drugs are dispensed only under a valid prescription and to patients who have a legitimate medical need for them,” said H. Peter Kuehl, Acting Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Miami Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who put profits above the health and safety of Americans.”Assistant United States Attorneys Perry H. Piper and Frank P. Clark represented the United States at trial and were assisted by paralegal Kris Eslinger.  The case was investigated by Special Agent Brian Kriplean, Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, and Special Agents Erik Srock and Marian Schmidt, Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Services.###Topic(s):Health Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - Tennessee, Eastern"

Hermsen, U.S. Food and Drug Administration Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations (“FDA-OCI”), and Troy Miller, Director of Field Operations for U.S. Customs and Border Protection in New York (“CBP”), announced the unsealing of four indictments charging 27 individuals with offenses relating to the systematic and covert administration of illegal performance-enhancing drugs (“PEDs”) to racehorses competing across the United States and abroad. The Indictments unsealed today each allege the shipment and administration of adulterated and misbranded drugs designed to secretly and dangerously enhance the racing performance of horses beyond their natural ability, a dishonest practice that places the lives of affected animals at risk.Of the 27 defendants, 19 – including trainers JORGE NAVARRO and JASON SERVIS – are charged in an indictment detailing four conspiracies to manufacture, distribute, and administer adulterated or misbranded drugs as set forth in United States v. Jorge Navarro, et al., 20 Cr. 160 (the “Navarro Indictment”), which has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil.  Of those defendants, 13 were taken into federal custody and are expected to be presented in the Southern District of New York today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Ona T. Wang.  Defendant SETH FISHMAN was previously charged by complaint in United States v. Seth Fishman, 19 Mag. 10120, and arrested on October 28, 2019, in Miami, Florida, and was presented in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The remaining defendants were arrested today outside of the Southern District of New York and adjacent districts, and will be presented today before the appropriate District Courts.Four additional defendants are charged in United States v. Louis Grasso, et al., 20 Cr. 163 (the “Grasso Indictment”), which has been assigned to U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel.  Two defendants are charged in United States v. Scott Robinson and Scott Mangini, 20 Cr. 162 (the “Robinson Indictment”), assigned to U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken; and two defendants are charged in United States v. Sarah Izhaki and Ashley Lebowitz, 20 Cr. 161 (the “Izhaki Indictment”), assigned to U.S. District Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil.Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said: “Today’s unsealing of four indictments for widespread doping of racehorses is the largest ever of its kind from the Department of Justice.  These defendants engaged in this conduct not for the love of the sport, and certainly not out of concern for the horses, but for money.  And it was the racehorses that paid the price for the defendants’ greed.  The care and respect due to the animals competing, as well as the integrity of racing, are matters of deep concern to the people of this District and to this Office.”FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: “These men allegedly saw the $100 billion dollar global horse racing industry as their way to get rich at the expense of the animals that were doing all the hard work.  Our investigation reveals the cruelty and inhumane treatment these horses suffered all to win a race.  The FBI New York Joint Eurasian Organized Crime Task Force worked along with our law enforcement partners at the New York State Police, FDA, and DEA to stop this ring of criminals from abusing helpless animals simply so they could cheat the odds and rake in millions of dollars.”Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said: “I want to commend our NYPD investigators, working with our federal partners, for carrying out a meticulous and important investigation. Putting the lives of horses at the center of an alleged plot to cheat professional horseracing around the world can never be accepted.”FDA Assistant Commissioner for Criminal Investigations Catherine A. Hermsen said: “The FDA is responsible for protecting not only the health of humans, but also of animals.  The manufacturing and trafficking of misbranded and unapproved animal drugs, and the administering of such drugs to racehorses to enhance their performance at the track, seriously endangers the health of these animals in pursuit of financial gain.  Today’s announcement should serve as a reminder of our continued focus on those individuals and companies that put profits ahead of the public health.”CBP Director of Field Operations Troy Miller said: “U.S. Customs and Border Protection is proud to have collaborated with our fellow law enforcement partners during this investigation. We value our partnerships and the arrests today demonstrate that together, no matter how complex the case, we will do what it takes to bring those who violate the law to justice.”According to the allegations contained in the Indictments,[1] other filings in this case, and statements during court proceedings:The charges in these four Indictments arise from an investigation of widespread schemes by racehorse trainers, veterinarians, PED distributors, and others to manufacture, distribute, and receive adulterated and misbranded PEDs and to secretly administer those PEDs to racehorses competing at all levels of professional horseracing.  By evading Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) rules and regulations, as well as prohibitions against the use of PEDs, and by deceiving regulators and horse racing officials, participants in these schemes sought to improve race performance and obtain prize money from racetracks throughout the United States and other countries, including in New York, New Jersey, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky, and the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”), notwithstanding the detriment and risk of the health and well-being of the racehorses.   Trainers who participated in the schemes stood to profit from the success of racehorses under their control by earning a share of their horses’ winnings, and by improving their horses’ racing records, thereby yielding higher trainer fees and increasing the number of racehorses under their control.  Veterinarians and drug distributors simply profited from the callous sale and administration of these medically unnecessary substances.The Navarro IndictmentTheNavarroIndictment charges 19 individuals representing a cross-section of corruption throughout the Thoroughbred and Standardbred racing industries.  As alleged, JORGE NAVARRO, a racehorse trainer, has participated in the doping of horses under his control using a variety of PEDs, including customized PEDs designed in part to evade normal anti-doping tests administered by racing regulators.  NAVARRO operated his doping scheme covertly, using a straw man to receive certain products designed to mask the presence of PEDs, avoiding explicit discussion of PEDs during certain telephone calls, and working with others to coordinate the administration of PEDs at times that racing officials would not detect such cheating.NAVARRO trained and doped XY Jet, a thoroughbred horse that won the 2019 Golden Shaheen race in Dubai.  As alleged, NAVARRO was intercepted during telephone conversations discussing his doping practices, and administered PEDs to XY Jet.  Among NAVARRO’s preferred PEDs were various “blood building” drugs, which, when administered before intense physical exertion, can lead to cardiac issues or death.  NAVARRO announced XY Jet’s death, as the result of an apparent heart attack, in January of this year.  Investigation of the circumstances of that death remains ongoing.NAVARRO was assisted by many of the charged defendants in the Navarro Indictment, and also assisted others, including JASON SERVIS, in obtaining adulterated and misbranded drugs to dope racehorses.As alleged, SERVIS doped virtually all horses under his control, including Maximum Security, the horse that crossed the finish line first in the 2019 Kentucky Derby before being disqualified for interference.  Among the misbranded and adulterated PEDs used by SERVIS was the drug “SGF-1000,” marketed and sold by defendant MICHAEL KEGLEY JR., among others, and which is compounded and manufactured in unregistered facilities.  SGF-1000, like many other customized PEDs, may cause racehorses to perform beyond their natural abilities, thereby increasing the risk of injuries.  SERVIS and others working with him, including veterinarians KRISTIAN RHEIN and ALEXANDER CHAN, attempted to conceal SERVIS’s doping practices through the use of falsified veterinary bills and fake prescriptions. SERVIS also tipped off NAVARRO to the presence of racing officials searching for signs of illegal doping. NAVARRO expressed his relief regarding SERVIS’ “tip”:  “[The track official] would’ve caught our asses fucking pumping and pumping and fuming every fucking horse [that] runs today.”TheNavarroIndictment also includes charges against veterinarian SETH FISHMAN who also created and shipped adulterated and misbranded drugs. As alleged, SETH FISHMAN, along with LISA GIANNELLI, JORDAN FISHMAN, and others, developed and distributed multiple illegal PEDs.  Those included “blood building” drugs specifically designed to evade anti-doping testing regimes.  On one occasion, SETH FISHMAN touted precisely this deceptive aspect of his illegal PEDs:  “[D]on’t kid yourself: if you’re giving something to a horse to make it better, and you’re not supposed to do that. . . .  That’s doping.  You know, whether or not it’s testable, that’s a different story.”Finally, theNavarroIndictment includes charges against trainer NICHOLAS SURICK who, among other things, distributed the adulterated and misbranded PED “red acid” (an anti-inflammatory drug) to NAVARRO.  SURICK also obtained and administered other adulterated and misbranded PEDs to horses under his care, including administering the blood building drug Epogen to the racehorse Northern Virgin.  SURICK and others then took extraordinary steps to physically conceal Northern Virgin from New Jersey state regulators seeking to test horses under SURICK’s control, for which SURICK is also charged with obstruction.The Grasso IndictmentTheGrassoIndictment charges four defendants, including veterinarian LOUIS GRASSO, with conspiring to violate the misbranding laws of the United States.  As alleged, GRASSO manufactured, sold, and distributed adulterated and misbranded PEDs for use on racehorses.  GRASSO also obtained and distributed other PEDs, including snake venom, a type of pain blocking substance.  GRASSO worked with DONATO POLISENO, a Delaware-based distributor of PEDs manufactured by GRASSO and others.  The Grasso Indictment also charges two horse trainers, THOMAS GUIDO III and CONOR FLYNN, with, among other things, causing the shipment of adulterated and misbranded PEDs prior to administering those drugs to horses under their control.  The dangers of that practice are reflected in the death of a horse doped by GUIDO in or about October 2019, about which GRASSO commented: “I’ve seen that happen 20 times.”The Robinson IndictmentSCOTT ROBINSON and SCOTT MANGINI are each charged with misbranding and adulteration conspiracies in the Robinson Indictment.  As alleged, the two defendants previously collaborated in running online marketplaces selling adulterated and misbranded PEDs for racehorses.  The drugs distributed through the defendants’ websites were manufactured in non-FDA registered facilities and carried significant risks to the animals affected through the administration of those illicit PEDs.  In one instance, on January 2, 2016, ROBINSON forwarded a customer complaint to MANGINI: “I[i.e., a customer contacting ROBINSON] ordered some [PED-1] . . . starting bout 8 hours after I give the injection and for about 36 hours afterwards both my horses act like they are heavily sedated, can barely walk.  Could I have a bad bottle of medicine, I’m afraid to give it anymore since this has happened three times.”  Commenting on this complaint, ROBINSON wrote, “here is another one.”The Izhaki IndictmentThe fourth Indictment unsealed today, theIzhakiIndictment, charges SARAH IZKAHI and ASHLEY LEBOWITZ in connection with their distribution of an adulterated and misbranded blood builder sourced illegally from a Mexico-based pharmaceutical company.  As alleged, IZHAKI has obtained this substance by smuggling the drug into the United States, where IZHAKI and LEBOWITZ distribute the drug to horse trainers in and around the New York City area.*                *                *A chart containing the names, charges, and maximum penalties for the defendants in each of the four Indictments is set forth below.  The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendants will be determined by the judge assigned to each case.Mr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the FBI’s Integrity in Sports and Gaming Initiative.  Mr. Berman also thanked the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office, the New York State Police, and the New York City Police Department for their support of this investigation, and Customs and Border Protection, the Food and Drug Administration and Drug Enforcement Administration for their assistance and expertise.This case is being handled by the Office’s Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit.  Assistant United States Attorneys Sarah Mortazavi, Benet J.

Fitzherbert pleaded guilty on September 3, 2019.According to court records, on February 6, 2018, Fitzherbert was arrested at his residence in Surry while agents were executing a search warrant there. While executing the warrant, agents from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recovered 91 counterfeit Oxycodone HCL pills from Fitzherbert’s bedroom that were later found to contain carfentanil. Fitzherbert admitted purchasing the pills through a “dark web” marketplace.“The opioid epidemic that has resulted in overdoses and deaths is a national public health crisis. Those who contribute to that crisis by illicitly distributing opioids, whether online or through conventional drug distribution methods, will be brought to justice,” said Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey J.

Krueger, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, announced that Philip D. Kuehnl (age 42) of Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, was sentenced in federal court for mail fraud and filing false tax returns.U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman sentenced Kuehnl to 14 months in prison and ordered him to pay more than $289,000 in restitution.During the period from approximately 2005 through April 2011, Kuehnl, who has also used the names Mike Hilton, Phil Kay, and Michael Helton, devised and carried out a scheme to defraud and to obtain money by means of material false and fraudulent pretenses and representations. Using various business names, including Premium Discount Pharmaceutical Services, Scrip Saver, Script Saver, Medico, Medico Alliance, and Medione, Kuehnl illegally marketed and sold medical devices, including devices purporting to be Synvisc, Orthovisc, and Hyalagan, to physicians, medical clinics, and other related businesses in the United States.Kuehnl falsely represented to his customers that he was associated with the manufacturers and legitimate distributions of these devices.  In fact, Kuehnl acquired the devices from unknown sources in Europe and smuggled them into the United States, where he re-packaged and re-labeled the devices to appear to come from domestic sources.  During his scheme, Kuehnl sold more than 100,000 devices for more than $5.6 million.  At the same time, Kuehnl reported virtually none of this income and paid little or no taxes.In December 2010, federal agents searched Kuehnl’s home in Pleasant Prairie and later interviewed Kuehnl.  During that interview, Kuehnl lied repeatedly about his business and concealed the fact that he had a bank account in Hong Kong.  Shortly after being interviewed, Kuehnl fled the United States and remained a fugitive until he was arrested in Thailand in 2018.   He has been in custody since that time.“Kuehnl’s greed led him to sell counterfeit medical devices, cheat on his taxes, and then flee from authorities,” said United States Attorney Krueger.  “IRS-Criminal Investigation, the FDA, and the prosecutor in this case showed outstanding persistence to ensure Kuehnl faces the consequences of his corruption.”Chicago Field Office Special Agent in Charge Kathy Enstrom stated, “Kuehnl’s sentencing demonstrates that IRS – Criminal Investigation is committed to working with our law enforcement partners in investigating and prosecuting those who line their pockets using fraudulent business practices and then victimize all taxpayers by continuing their schemes and not paying taxes on their profits.”This matter was investigated by the Office of Criminal Investigations of the Food and Drug Administration and Criminal investigation Division of the Internal Revenue and was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Matthew L.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of IllinoisFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, February 12, 2020Melissa Scanlan (a/k/a “The Drug Llama”) has been sentenced to 160 months in federal prison in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois for trafficking fentanyl throughout the United States via the “dark web,” engaging in an international money laundering conspiracy, and distributing fentanyl that results in death.The crimes for which Scanlan was sentenced are as follows: one count of conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, five counts of distributing fentanyl, one count of selling counterfeit drugs, one count of misbranding drugs, one count of conspiracy to commit international money laundering, and one count of distribution of fentanyl resulting in death. The 32-year old San Diego native pleaded guilty to those charges in October 2019. Scanlan’s co-conspirator, Brandon Arias, 34, was previously sentenced to nine years in federal prison for his role in the conspiracy.Facts disclosed in open court revealed that Scanlan and Arias created an account on “Dream Market,” a dark web1 marketplace where users buy and sell illegal substances and services, and used that account to sell substantial quantities of narcotics while operating under the moniker, “The Drug Llama.” The charged fentanyl distribution conspiracy lasted from October 2016 to August 2018, during which time Scanlan sold approximately 52,000 fentanyl pills throughout the United States.According to court records, Scanlan and Arias made over $100,000 from their dark web drug trafficking and split the money evenly. Court records also demonstrated Scanlan’s participation in an international money laundering conspiracy with Mexican cartel members, as well as her role in aiding and abetting the distribution of fentanyl pills to a woman identified as A.W., who later died.Commenting on the case, U.S. Attorney Steven D. Weinhoeft assailed the culture of criminality that exists on the dark web. “Criminals like Melissa Scanlan who recklessly flood our communities with opioids may think they can evade detection in the shadowy corners and back alleys of the internet. But they will find no quarter there. Where they go, we will follow. With the collaboration of outstanding investigators at our partner agencies, we will use every tool and method available to find these people and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law.” U.S. Attorney Steven D. Weinhoeft also noted that this prosecution further underscores the critical need for Congress to permanently criminalize fentanyl analogues.“Illicit opioid distribution, whether online or through conventional drug distribution methods, and the resulting overdoses and deaths are a continuing national crisis; those who contribute to that crisis through their illegal actions will be brought to justice,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L. Grinstead, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Kansas City Field Office. “We are fully committed to disrupting and dismantling illegal prescription drug distribution networks that misuse the internet at the expense of public health and safety.”“With accessibility of fentanyl, it is imperative that the Drug Enforcement Administration and its law enforcement partners exploit all distribution avenues utilized by drug traffickers in Scanlan’s case,” stated DEA Special Agent in Charge William J. Callahan of the St. Louis Division. “Scanlan distributed poison in our community that resulted in death and she is now being held accountable.”This case was part of a months-long, coordinated national operation involving the Food and Drug Administration – Office of Criminal Investigations, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Department of Homeland Security, United States Customs and Border Protection, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California, and the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Illinois. Assistant U.S. Attorney Derek J. Wiseman is the prosecuting attorney on the case.1The dark web is an underground computer network that is unreachable by traditional search engines and Web Browsers.

Sentencing is scheduled in Miami, Florida for April 23, 2020.A fourth conspirator,Edgar Torres, 61, of Brandford, Florida, pled guilty to wire fraud conspiracy on June 24, 2019. Torres is scheduled to be sentenced in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida on February 11, 2020.According to the evidence presented at trial, between 2013 and 2018, the defendants, who also maintained residences in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, orchestrated an elaborate scheme to obtain FDA-regulated products from manufacturers in the United States at deeply discounted prices, including infant formula, eye-care products, and other food and medical devices. To get these discounts, Doekhie and Nabi told the manufacturers that they were purchasing the products to ship overseas, to Suriname, often in connection with purported government procurement contracts they held in Suriname. In fact, Defendants did not have government procurement contracts and never intended to export the products to Suriname. Instead, Grobman and others sold the products in the United States for tens of millions of dollars, which the three defendants later split among themselves.The defendants hid their activity from the victim companies in one of three ways.  The first was to send “dummy” shipments abroad. The dummy shipments did not contain the products purchased from the manufacturers, but they did generate documentation to prove that an export occurred. The second method was to “U-turn” the products: The products were shipped abroad, generating export documentation. As soon as they arrived overseas, they were shipped back to the United States. The third method was to create fraudulent export shipping documentation showing that the products were exported when they actually never left the country.According to the superseding indictment, over $61 million in criminal proceeds is traceable to Grobman. Over $69 million is traceable to Doekhie and Nabi.This case is the second large-scale prosecution by the South Florida U.S. Attorney’s Office and FDA-OCI targeting fraud schemes related to the so-called “gray market,” which involves the diversion and re-sale of certain goods that were not intended for distribution in the United States.  Previously on September 4, 2019, U.S. Attorney Fajardo Orshan announced the convictions of five defendants, including Byramji Javat, a citizen of Pakistan and Chairman of the Dubai-based Uniworld Group, for various offenses relating to a global fraud scheme that relied upon false claims about the United States military and the Government of Afghanistan.U.S. Attorney Fajardo Orshan commended the investigative efforts of FDA-OCI. She also thanked the Broward County Sherriff’s Office for their assistance. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Shannon Shaw, Christopher Browne, and John Shipley prosecuted the case.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Adrienne Rosen is handling asset forfeiture.Related court documents and information may be found on the website of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida atwww.flsd.uscourts.govor athttp://pacer.flsd.uscourts.gov.Topic(s):Financial FraudComponent(s):USAO - Florida, Southern"

Byron has sentenced Barry Clint Wright (38, Monroe, NC) to the maximum statutory sentence of seven years in federal prison for introducing an unapproved drug into interstate commerce, introducing a misbranded drug into interstate commerce, and introducing an unapproved drug into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud or mislead.  Wright had pleaded guilty on November 1, 2019.According to court documents, 2,4-Dinitrophenol (DNP) is a chemical substance that, when ingested, causes rapid loss of weight, but is also associated with a high rate of adverse effects including cataracts, hyperthermia, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmia, and death. In 1938, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared DNP to be extremely dangerous and not fit for human consumption. At that time, the FDA announced publicly that it would prosecute those who manufacture and distribute DNP for use as a drug.According to court records, between December 2015 and May 2018, Wright sold DNP to consumers throughout the United States and in a number of foreign countries as a weight loss drug. Wright purchased bulk DNP and encapsulated it into ingestible pills. He also created several websites to market the pills. Wright did not label the pills as DNP, nor did he include any directions or warnings regarding the use of the drug when he mailed it to consumers. Three of these consumers died during or shortly after their DNP use. The official cause of death for two of these victims, 21-year-old V.G. (East London, United Kingdom) and 46-year-old J.P. (Marietta, GA), was DNP toxicity. The other victim, 26-year-old C.W. (Lake Mary, FL), died from cardiac arrhythmia, which can be caused by the use of DNP.This case was investigated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations.

McSwain announced that Jonathan Nyce, 70, of Collegeville, PA, was charged by Indictment with wire fraud and the interstate shipment of misbranded animal drugs. The charges arise from a years-long scheme to defraud pet owners of money by falsely claiming to sell canine cancer-curing drugs.The Indictment alleges that the defendant created several companies beginning in 2012, including “Canine Care,” “ACGT,” and “CAGT,” through which he purported to develop drugs intended to treat cancer in dogs. Using various websites for these companies, the defendant marketed these “cancer-curing” medications to desperate pet owners, using the drug names “Tumexal” and “Naturasone.” The websites made numerous allegedly false and fraudulent claims regarding the safety and efficacy of these supposed drugs, including that “Tumexal is effective against a wide variety of cancers,” and, “[i]n fact, Tumexal will almost always restore a cancer-stricken dog’s appetite, spirit and energy!” As alleged, these drugs were nothing more than a collection of bulk ingredients from various sources, which the defendant blended together himself at a facility on Arcola Road in Collegeville.Further, through email and telephone conversations, Nyce allegedly induced the owners of terminally ill dogs to pay him hundreds or thousands of dollars for these drugs by touting the effectiveness of his products in treating a host of canine cancers. He also told prospective customers that their pets could become part of clinical trials, but in order to do so, they had to pay him large sums of money. The defendant’s marketing, sale, and shipment of these drugs in interstate commerce is alleged to have violated the Food and Drug Administration’s Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act because the drugs were not approved by the FDA. The defendant even falsely claimed in promotional materials that his company’s research was “funded in part by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.”“The defendant’s alleged conduct here is shameful,” said U.S. Attorney McSwain. “As any dog owner will tell you – myself included – pets quickly become part of the family. And when they become sick, caring owners look for hope, often doing everything they can to keep their beloved pets alive and well. The defendant is charged with taking advantage of that nurturing instinct in the worst way possible by defrauding pet owners and giving them false hope that they might be able to save their dying pet. That is both cruel and illegal, and now the defendant will face the consequences.”“American pet owners rely on the FDA to ensure their pets’ drugs are safe and effective,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark McCormack, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Field Office.  “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who ignore or attempt to circumvent the law.”If convicted, the defendant faces a maximum possible sentence of 32 years imprisonment and a fine of up to $1,250,000.The case was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigation, and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Christopher E. Parisi.An indictment, information, or criminal complaint is an accusation. A defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.Topic(s):Financial FraudComponent(s):USAO - Pennsylvania, Eastern"

The indictment was returned and unsealed in Cincinnati.According to the 21-count indictment, since 2013, co-conspirators used several Dark Web marketplace accounts and encrypted messaging apps in order to sell illegal drugs online.The defendants allegedly specialized in the manufacturing and distribution of more than one million fentanyl-laced counterfeit pills and laundered approximately $2.8 million over the course of the conspiracy. The pressed fentanyl pills, along with heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine, were shipped to the Southern District of Ohio and throughout the country.Named in the indictment are: Khlari Sirotkin, 36, of Colorado; Kelly Stephens, 32, of Colorado; Sean Deaver, 36, of Nevada; Abby Jones, 37, of Nevada; and Sasha Sirotkin, 32, of California. Each is charged in all 21 counts. Each of the five defendants was arrested in December and has appeared in federal court in Cincinnati.The investigation was coordinated out of the Cincinnati Field Office of the FBI and is part of an Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) joint investigation conducted by the Southern Ohio Digitized Organized Crime Group. The investigation was significantly aided by the Department of Justice’s multi-agency Special Operations Division (SOD).The narcotics conspiracy in this case is punishable by 10 years up to life in prison. The money laundering conspiracy is punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Individual counts of distributing and attempting to distribute fentanyl or heroin also carry potential maximum penalties of 20 years in prison. Selling counterfeit drugs is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Congress sets minimum and maximum statutory sentences. Sentencing of defendants will be determined by the Court based on the advisory sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors.“It doesn’t matter to us if you’re out on the streets or behind a computer screen in the comfort of your own home – if you deal fentanyl, as is alleged here, we will identify you and we will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law,” said U.S. Attorney David M. DeVillers.“This case demonstrates that as organized criminals leverage technologies such as the Dark Web, encrypted messaging applications, and cryptocurrencies to conceal their illegal activities, the FBI and our partners will employ sophisticated techniques, creative methods, and a joint effort to hold them accountable,” stated FBI Cincinnati Special Agent in Charge Chris Hoffman.“Unscrupulous people who use the darknet as a marketplace for selling and distributing illegal and dangerous prescription drugs will be found,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L. Grinstead, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Kansas City Field Office. “We are fully committed to disrupting and dismantling illegal prescription drug distribution networks that misuse the internet at the expense of public health and safety.”“Not even the shadowy corners of the Dark Web can provide a safe haven for drug dealers,” said Drug Enforcement Administration Special Agent in Charge Keith Martin. “Law enforcement is committed to tracking down drug traffickers’ distribution networks no matter where they operate.”“Battling the distribution of synthetic drugs via the U.S. Mail is one of the Postal Inspection Service’s highest priorities,” said Inspector in Charge Tommy Coke. “This case proves Postal Inspectors and our law enforcement partners remain steadfast in dismantling organizations which are distributing these illicit and dangerous drugs across the U.S. This case involved hard work and dedication from multiple field divisions for both the USPIS and our partners. We will remain unwavering in our mission to identify and disrupt their illegal activity.”\"These individuals are alleged to have trafficked large quantities of highly addictive drugs through our local communities and into our surrounding states,” said Vance Callender HSI Special Agent in Charge for Michigan and Ohio. “This dismantlement of this organization demonstrates HSI’s ability to combat the ongoing epidemic affecting Ohio.\"“These aren’t street corner drug pushers – this conspiracy allegedly infiltrated our communities and sold fentanyl in the dank depths of the internet and sent it to mailboxes and doorsteps,” Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said. “Ohioans are safer, thanks to the work of our narcotics agents and federal partners who untangle webs of deception and death.”David M.

Neill’s) of Columbia, North Carolina, and Phillip R. Carawan, the owner, President, and Chief Executive of Capt. Neill’s, were sentenced today by U.S. District Judge Louise Flanagan, in New Bern, North Carolina. Capt. Neill’s was sentenced to a period of five years’ probation and is required to pay a $500,000 fine. Carawan was sentenced to 12 months and one day in prison, followed by three years of supervised release, and is required to pay a $250,000 fine for his role in falsely labeling millions of dollars’ worth of foreign crab meat as “Product of USA.”“Individuals and companies who seek to profit from the fraudulent mislabeling of seafood harm American fishermen and consumers,” said Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Bossert Clark for the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division. “We are committed to working with our law enforcement partners to hold accountable those who engage in seafood fraud and mislabeling.”“Seafood mislabeling is consumer fraud that undermines efforts of hardworking, honest fisherman and the free market by devaluing the price of domestic seafood,” said Acting U.S. Attorney General Norman Acker III for the Eastern District of North Carolina.  “In this case, the fraudulent scheme artificially deflated the cost of domestic blue crab and gave Carawan an unacceptable economic advantage over law-abiding competitors.”“Combating seafood fraud continues to be a priority for the NOAA Office of Law Enforcement,” said Director Jim Landon of the Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Law Enforcement.  “The effects of this type of fraud impact not only the consumer, but also honest fishermen and the livelihoods of others in the fishing industry.  We will continue to identify and investigate those who seek to undermine the legal requirement to accurately label seafood products.”Capt. Neill’s and Carawan were engaged in the business of purchasing, processing, packaging, transporting, and selling seafood and seafood products, including crab meat from domestically harvested blue crab. According to their plea agreements, Capt. Neill’s and Carawan admitted that beginning at least as early as 2012, and continuing through June 16, 2015, Carawan directed company employees to repack foreign crab meat into containers labeled “Product of USA,” which Capt. Neill’s then sold to customers as jumbo domestically harvested blue crab. The falsely labeled crabmeat was then sold primarily to wholesale membership clubs, but also to retailers. Capt. Neill’s and Carawan further admitted that during that time period, the retail market value of the mislabeled crabmeat they sold was $4,082.841.As part of his plea agreement, Carawan further admitted that he and his company could not and did not process sufficient quantities of domestic blue crab to meet customer demands. To make up the shortfall, Carawan and his company used foreign crab meat to fulfill customer orders. During the periods when the company did not have a sufficient supply of domestic crab, Carawan and Capt. Neill’s purchased crab meat (not live crabs) from South America and Asia.As a result of the plea and sentence, Capt. Neill’s will pay restitution to persons whom the government confirmed purchased Capt. Neill’s jumbo crab meat between 2012 and June 16, 2015.

Gurry, 56, of Scottsdale, Ariz., was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs to 33 months in prison, three years of supervised release, restitution to be determined at a later date, and ordered to pay approximately $3.6 million in forfeiture. The government recommended a sentence of 132 months in prison. In May 2019, Gurry was convicted by a federal jury of racketeering conspiracy along with four other Insys executives.Subsys, a drug owned and manufactured by a company called Insys Therapeutics, Inc., is a powerful, rapid-onset opioid approved to treat cancer patients suffering intense breakthrough pain. From May 2012 to December 2015, Gurry and his co-defendants conspired to bribe practitioners, many of whom operated pain clinics, in order to induce them to prescribe Insys’ fentanyl-based pain medication, Subsys, to patients, often when medically unnecessary. The drug was expensive, and while bribes paid to prescribers succeeded in generating new prescriptions, insurers were reluctant to approve payment when Subsys was prescribed for patients without cancer.Within the criminal scheme, Gurry was responsible for creating and overseeing the Insys Reimbursement Center (IRC), which was dedicated to obtaining prior authorization for payment of Subsys prescriptions directly from insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. Beginning in October 2012, Gurry authorized employees of the IRC to lead insurers to believe that they were calling from the office of the prescriber. He also authorized the IRC employees to use a misleading script, known as “the spiel,” to trick insurers into believing that Subsys had been prescribed to the patient to treat breakthrough cancer pain, for which insurers were more likely to authorize payment. Gurry also authorized other tactics that had been found to be more successful in securing payment from insurers. This included citing a diagnosis of “dysphagia” – difficulty swallowing – even when patients were not suffering from the disorder and referencing a history of cancer to mislead insurers.United States Attorney Andrew E.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of UtahFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEMonday, January 13, 2020Through Drug Diversion, Seven (Known) Patients Were Infected with Hepatitis-CSALT LAKE CITY – Elet Neilson, age 53, of Layton, a former emergency room nurse who admitted to tampering with controlled substances intended for patients and diverting the drugs for her own use, will serve 60 months in federal prison.  U.S. District Judge Dee Benson imposed the sentence Monday afternoon in Salt Lake City.As a result of the tampering and diversion, Neilson admitted infecting seven (known) patients with Hepatitis-C 2B. Hepatitis C, which is a viral disease, is primarily transmitted through blood exposure.  There are different genotpyes. One variant, Hepatitis-C 2B, makes up only 8 to 10 percent of all Hepatitis C found in humans in Utah, according to the indictment filed in the case.Federal prosecutors had asked Judge Benson to impose a sentence of 90 months.  “This is more than a mistake.  Punishment and general deterrence should be the driving force in fashioning a sentence today,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Sam Pead said. Judge Benson’s sentence of 60 months was three months below the sentencing guideline range in the case of 63-78 months.  The court found she abused a position of trust in imposing the sentence.“As sad as addiction may be, it is not without victims. This case illustrates addiction’s wake of tragedy like few others,” U.S. Attorney for Utah John W. Huber said today. “At least seven unwitting and innocent victims were in vulnerable positions when the nurse defendant recklessly exposed them to, and infected them with a serious and stigmatizing disease. These convictions represent knowing and intentional conduct that went well beyond an unwise decision made amidst addiction.”“Patients deserve to have confidence that they are not only receiving the proper treatment from those entrusted with providing their medical care, but also that they are not being placed at an increased risk of harm,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L. Grinstead, of the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, Kansas City Field Office.  “We will continue to protect the public health and bring to justice health care professionals who take advantage of their unique position and compromise their patients’ health and comfort by tampering with needed drugs.”Between July 2013 and November 2014, Neilson was employed at McKay-Dee Hospital in Ogden, Utah. As a nurse, Neilson had access to controlled substances, including medication intended for patients in the emergency room. As a part of a plea agreement reached in September 2019, Neilson admitted that on multiple occasions, she tampered with hydromorphone and morphine, diverting the drugs for her own use.According to the plea agreement, Neilson admitted that by tampering, diverting, and using the drugs, she acted with reckless disregard for the risk to other people, including placing people in danger of death or bodily injury, and did so under circumstances that manifested extreme indifference to that risk.In late 2014, according to charges filed in the case, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and the Utah Department of Health began an investigation into a cluster of Hepatitis C 2B diagnoses in the Ogden region, which eventually focused on patients seen in the emergency room at McKay-Dee Hospital while Neilson was working there. The investigation ultimately determined that seven patients, each of whom were given intravenous opioid pain management drugs handled by Neilson before or during their administration, were infected with not only the same genotype of Hepatitis-C 2B as Neilson, but the same sub-genotype.“Neilson, a medical professional, diverted drugs for her own use, and as a result infected her patients.  For that she will rightly be punished,” said Curt L. Muller, Special Agent in Charge of the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Kansas City Region. “Along with our law enforcement partners, protecting patients is our top priority.”“When professionals in positions of trust, abuse that trust by engaging in the diversion of controlled substances, it is extremely disappointing. Anyone who deliberately diverts and tampers with controlled substances causing harm to patients, has violated their duties as a professional and will be held accountable,” said Acting Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the DEA Salt Lake City District Office Miguel Chino.  “The charge and plea agreement in this case are the result of DEA’s continued commitment to work with our law enforcement partners and hold accountable those who participate in illegally diverting controlled substances in our communities. It also is a testament to law enforcement’s commitment to fight the illegal diversion of these drugs.”\"Medical professionals are entrusted with the care of others.  Elet Neilson betrayed that trust and in turn, put her patients' health and lives at risk,\" said Special Agent in Charge Paul Haertel of the FBI's Salt Lake City Field Office.  \"The FBI would like to thank our law enforcement partners for their dedication and persistence in a case that should serve as an example that such reckless behavior within our nation's health care system will be aggressively investigated and prosecuted.\"“The mission of the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU) in the Utah Attorney General’s Office is to protect vulnerable individuals from harm.  The victims in this case went to the hospital for treatment, trusting that they would be safe and cared for.  Instead, because of the defendant’s actions, the victims came out of the hospital with life-changing diseases.  The MFCU is proud to have been part of a team that brought this nurse to justice and gave a voice to each victim,” Kaye Lynn Wootton, MFCU Director, said today.Neilson will be on supervised release for two years when she finishes her federal prison sentence.  Special conditions of the supervised release include drug/alcohol and mental health treatment. She must pay a $400 special assessment fee.  The court ordered Neilson to self-surrender to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to begin serving the sentence no later than March 2 at noon.  BOP will designate a prison in the coming weeks.###"

Thomas, 35, of Cumberland, R.I., was sentenced today by U.S. District Court Judge Richard G. Stearns to one year of probation. Yesterday, Judge Stearns sentenced Kathy S. Chin, 47, of Canton, to two years of probation. In May 2019, Thomas and Chin were convicted by a federal jury of two and four felony counts, respectively, of dispensing drugs without valid prescriptions with the intent to defraud or mislead government regulators and customers.NECC, a licensed pharmacy, routinely dispensed drugs in bulk without valid prescriptions. Chin and Thomas served as verification pharmacists, signing off on drug orders prior to shipment to customers. Chin was convicted of approving shipments of drugs for patients with names such as Flash Gordon, Long John, Tony Tiger, Chester Cheeto, Dale Earnhardt, Tom Brokaw, Jon Stewart, Jay Leno, David Letterman, and Dick Van Dyke, among others. Thomas was convicted of approving shipments of drugs for patients with names such as L.L. Bean, Filet O’Fish, Rug Doctor, Squeaky Wheel, Dingo Boney, Coco Puff, and Harry Potter, among others.Chin and Thomas dispensed these and other bulk orders of prescription drugs with the intent to defraud and mislead state and federal government regulators. Specifically, NECC repeatedly took steps to shield its operations from regulatory oversight by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by claiming to be a pharmacy dispensing drugs pursuant to valid, patient-specific prescriptions. The jury heard evidence that the fake prescriptions, along with numerous other bulk drug orders, approved by Chin and Thomas allowed NECC to operate as an unregulated drug manufacturer.In June 2017, Barry Cadden, the former owner and head pharmacist for NECC, was sentenced to nine years in prison and three years of supervised release after being convicted of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud, and introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud and mislead. In January 2018, Glenn Chin, NECC’s former supervisory pharmacist, was sentenced to eight years in prison and two years of supervised release after being convicted of 77 counts. In total, 13 NECC defendants have been convicted of 178 charges.United States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling; FDA Commissioner ADM Brett P. Giroir, M.D.; Joseph R.

In order to maximize corporate profits, the pharmacy ignored numerous red flags that should have prevented them from dispensing the prescription medications written by the pill mill, such as: (1) an abnormally high amount of prescriptions for widely-abused, highly-addictive controlled substances such as oxycodone; (2) prescribed controlled substances to patients for long periods of time; (3) permitted refills before prior prescriptions should have run out; (4) ignored obvious signs that patients were drug addicts; (5) patients travelled long distances and from out of state; (6) multiple pill mill physicians issued prescriptions to the same patient; (7) numerous family members who were all patients of the pill mill, came to the pharmacy at the same time; (8) insurance companies refused to pay for prescriptions from the pill mill; and (9) cash-only transactions.Meds2Go Express Pharmacy, Inc. admitted that it engaged in illegal manufacturing of its own supply of oxycodone and methadone due to supply and demand by “compounding” pills in mass quantities at its locations Alum Creek and Charleston. Due to the excessive amount of prescriptions for controlled substances written by the pill mill, the pharmacy could not obtain enough of a supply of oxycodone and methadone from its distributors. In order to keep up with the demand, the pharmacy bypassed purchase restrictions from the distributor by setting up and purchasing compounding equipment, training its employees to compound pills on a mass scale, purchasing powders and other raw materials, and manufacturing pills containing oxycodone and methadone. The compounded pills were then sold to cash-paying customers who had prescriptions written by the pill mill. The pharmacy used the proceeds from the illegal manufacturing and dispensing to carry on the operations of business.As part of the plea agreement with the United States, Meds2Go Express Pharmacy, Inc. agreed that it will shut down and pay $250,000 toward community restitution and a forfeiture money judgment. The community restitution will be paid for the costs associated with drug abuse treatment in West Virginia to redress the harm caused by illicit opioid usage stemming from the sale of prescription opioids.  The West Virginia Crime Victim's Compensation Fund will receive 65% of the community restitution amount, and 35% will be paid to West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources, Bureau of Behavioral Health and Health Facilities.United States District Judge Irene C. Berger presided over the hearing.  The investigation was conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration – Office of Inspector General (OIG) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services – Office of Inspector General (OIG).  Assistant United States Attorneys Andrew Tessman and Steven I.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of MassachusettsFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, December 20, 2019BOSTON – A federal jury in Boston convicted an Illinois man yesterday of defrauding insurance companies in relation to a high-priced drug made by Cambridge-based pharmaceutical company Aegerion Pharmaceuticals Inc., and for using the identities of physicians to carry out the fraud.Mark Moffett, 47, of Springfield, Ill., was convicted of nine counts of wire fraud and six counts of aggravated identity theft. U.S. District Court Judge William G. Young scheduled sentencing for April 9, 2020.“Mr. Moffett stole doctors’ identities, obtained fraudulent prescriptions, falsified test results, and forged insurance documents in an effort to sell a powerful drug,” said United States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling. “He ignored the serious consequences it could have on patients’ health, caring more about lining his own pockets. Mr. Moffett’s conviction is part of our ongoing effort to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for violating laws that protect patient safety and the integrity of the health care system.”“Mark Moffett took matters into his own hands by defrauding Medicare and potentially putting patients’ health at risk for his own financial benefit,” said Joseph R. Bonavolonta, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Field Division. “The FBI would like to thank the jury for their swift verdict, and we will continue to vigorously investigate healthcare fraud matters to protect the public’s interest.”“Greed was at the very core of Mark Moffett’s scheme to defraud our federal healthcare system,” said Phillip M. Coyne, Special Agent in Charge for the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Office of Inspector General. “This type of fraud is corrosive, wastes taxpayer funds, and drives up healthcare costs. We will continue to aggressively root out these fraud schemes and bring criminals to justice.”“The Employee Benefits Security Administration is pleased to have had the opportunity to work collaboratively with our law enforcement partners on this investigation. I commend the exceptional work performed by our investigators and their law enforcement partners. This office will continue to vigorously pursue cases where participants and private sector health benefit plans are victimized by unscrupulous and illegal pharmaceutical sales practices,” said Carol S. Hamilton, Acting Regional Director of the U.S. Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security Administration, Boston Regional OfficeIn 2014 and 2015, Moffett, a pharmaceutical sales representative for Aegerion, marketed the company’s cholesterol drug Juxtapid. Juxtapid was approved by the FDA only to treat high cholesterol in patients with a rare genetic disease called homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (“HoFH”). The FDA approved the drug only to treat HoFH patients because the drug carried serious risks of side effects, including liver damage. The drug’s label included a black box warning.Moffett nonetheless convinced doctors to prescribe Juxtapid, which costs over $300,000 per year, for patients without HoFH. In order to defraud Medicare and private sector employee health plans into paying for a drug they only covered for FDA-approved uses, Moffett obtained fraudulent prescriptions and falsified numerous documents, including statements of medical necessity and other insurance documents. This included false patient test results, false clinical histories and false diagnoses. Moffett used the identities of several cardiologists to carry out the fraud. He was paid bonuses by Aegerion of up to $11,000 for each prescription of Juxtapid.The charge of wire fraud provides for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 per count. The charge of aggravated identity theft provides for a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison to be serve consecutive to any other sentence imposed. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.U.S. Attorney Lelling, FBI Boston SAC Bonavolonta, HSI-OIG SAC Coyne, and DOL-EBSA Acting Regional Director Hamilton made the announcement.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeEastern District of PennsylvaniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASETuesday, December 17, 2019PHILADELPHIA – United States Attorney William M. McSwain announced that Thomas J. Whalen, D.O., 65, of Havertown, Pennsylvania, pled guilty to charges related to his unlawful importation of foreign, non-FDA approved injectable medications that he falsely billed to health care benefit programs in the amount of nearly $2.3 million. The Delaware County rheumatologist also pleaded guilty to unlawfully distributing oxycodone. Whalen knowingly prescribed oxycodone to patients actively using illicit drugs, including heroin and cocaine.Whalen pled guilty to an Information charging him with one count of health care fraud, one count of importation contrary to law, and two counts of distribution of a controlled substance. He is scheduled to be sentenced on April 1, 2020, by U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Savage, who accepted his plea. Whalen faces a maximum possible sentence of 70 years’ imprisonment, a $2,500,000 fine, 3 years’ supervised release, and a $400 mandatory special assessment.Whalen owned and operated Rheumatology Consultants, P.C., doing business as Whalen Rheumatology Group, with locations in Havertown, PA, Exton, PA, and Wilmington, DE. As part of his practice, Whalen used medications administrated by injection and infusion to treat his patients. These medications, including Remicade Synvisc, Synvisc-One, Orencia, Prolia/Xgeva, and Boniva, are made of living cells and are expensive. Rather than purchase FDA-approved versions of these medicines from authorized distributors, Whalen devised a scheme to purchase much cheaper foreign, non-FDA approved versions of these medications. Unbeknownst to his patients, Whalen injected or infused his patients with the non-FDA approved medications and then billed federal health care programs, pocketing approximately $1.1 million in illicit gains.Whalen also prescribed oxycodone to patients abusing illicit drugs. The Information lists two patients to whom Whalen prescribed oxycodone despite receiving multiple urine drug screening results for each that revealed that the patients were simultaneously abusing cocaine and heroin.“This guilty plea from Dr. Whalen is the latest example of my Office’s commitment to stopping health care fraud and diversion,” said U.S. Attorney McSwain. “We work closely with our partners in the Fraud Section’s Health Care Fraud Strike Force and will continue to root out fraud in the medical profession. Specifically, we are committed to stopping criminals in the medical profession from stealing from public programs, threatening the safety of patients, and pushing illegal pills onto the streets.”“Dr. Whalen placed the health of countless patients at risk by administering non-FDA approved drugs. Such medications are not paid for by Medicare due to the risk they may pose to patient health,” said Special Agent in Charge Maureen R. Dixon of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General. “Our watchdog agency, along with our law enforcement partners, will continue to protect the public and root out dangerous and costly fraud schemes.”“Dr. Whalen has pleaded guilty to the unlawful distribution of oxycodone, which is a powerful prescription painkiller. Of particular concern is that he knowingly prescribed oxycodone to patients that were abusing illegal street drugs such as cocaine and heroin,” said Jonathan A. Wilson, Special Agent in Charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) Philadelphia Field Division.  “Doctors have a professional and moral obligation to treat patients that are struggling with substance use disorder – not enable it.”“Dr. Whalen imported and used non-FDA approved drugs from Turkey and the United Kingdom, without any regard for the safety and health of his patients. In addition, he prescribed powerful pain killers to patients already struggling with addiction,” said William Walker, Acting Special Agent in Charge of HSI Philadelphia. “Doctors take an oath to do no harm. This oath was clearly betrayed by not only committing healthcare fraud for his own financial gain, but by contributing to our nation’s opioid crisis.” Walker continued, “Thanks to our partnership with Customs and Border Protection, we have brought one more person to justice, and many more individuals out of harm’s way.”“When healthcare professionals import unsafe, untested prescription drugs from outside the drug supply chain that the FDA oversees, the American public health and trust are jeopardized,” said Mark S. McCormack, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office. “The FDA is committed to pursuing and bringing to justice those who attempt to subvert the safeguards of our closed drug supply by distributing unapproved products.”The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Homeland Security Investigations, the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated the case.

Middlebrooks for their respective involvement in a global fraud scheme based upon false claims about the United States military and the Government of Afghanistan.Six individuals were charged for their involvement in the global fraud scheme (Case No. 18-20668-CR-DMM).  Four individuals previously pled guilty, one was convicted at trial and charges are pending against a final defendant.Byramji Javat, a citizen of Pakistan and Chairman of the Dubai-based Uniworld Group, pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.  The Court sentenced Javat to 120 months in prison after finding him responsible for a fraud loss of approximately $60 million during the period of the conspiracy.  The court also imposed a $150,000 fine and ordered Javat to pay forfeiture and restitution, in amounts to be determined at a future hearing.Luis Soto, a customs broker residing in Miami, was convicted by a trial jury of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to obtain pre-retail medical products worth $5,000 or more by fraud or deception, two counts of wire and two counts of obtaining pre-retail medical products by fraud or deception.  The Court sentenced Soto to 72 months in prison and ordered him to forfeit $100,000.Sunil ChopraandWilliam Armando, both residents of California, pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to obtain pre-retail medical products worth $5,000 or more by fraud or deception and were sentenced to 36 and 18 months in prison, respectively.Emanuel Daskos, of Hallandale Beach, Florida, pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to obtain pre-retail medical products worth $5,000 or more by fraud or deception and was sentenced to 2 years of probation.  He was also ordered to pay a $20,000 fine, $501,304 in restitution, and forfeit $18,536.  One defendant, James Sipprell, a resident of Georgia, is awaiting trial and is presumed innocent.According to the superseding indictment, between 2014 and 2017, Javat orchestrated a fraud scheme to purchase FDA-regulated products including medical devices from manufacturers in the United States at deeply discounted prices by lying to them about the destination and purpose of the goods.  Javat represented that he was a large supplier of medical and food products to United States troops in Afghanistan, and sought deep discounts from the manufacturers by claiming that he could provide their goods to American troops in Afghanistan or to the Afghan people.  In truth, Javat wanted to obtain these products at prices not generally offered in the United States in order to sell those products himself in this country – not abroad, and not to the military – at a significant profit.To execute this scheme, the conspirators insisted that products be packaged for the United States market, falsely claiming to the manufacturers that this was required by the U.S. military, the Afghan government, or the “Buy American Act.”   When the products nonetheless had stickers or other packaging on them stating that the items were for export only, the conspirators secretly removed those labels.  After acquiring the products, Javat and the co-conspirators arranged for the diversion of the products to various locations in the United States.  To conceal this activity, the conspirators typically shipped the products abroad and then had them immediately shipped back to the United States, or provided the victims with fraudulent shipping documentation showing that the products were exported when actually they had never left this country.Javat admitted the allegations of the superseding indictment during his guilty plea.  During Soto’s trial, the government proved these allegations to the jury and presented additional evidence about the defendants’ scheme.  For example, the conspirators often represented that they were purchasing items on behalf of the Afghanistan Reconstruction and Development Services (“ARDS”), which at one time was an agency of the Afghan Government funded in part by the United States.  That agency ceased to exist after 2014, yet the conspirators provided victims with fake documents supposedly from ARDS imposing extravagant demands that in reality only suited the conspirators’ needs.  In 2016, Uniworld prepared an internal Powerpoint presentation expressly informing its staff that they had to be “good at lying.”  Finally, because these goods were moving outside normal channels, they often were mishandled; for example, according to the conspirators’ own emails at the time, the defendants disregarded temperature requirements when transshipping over-the-counter pain medicines, one of the defendants kept a shipment of diabetic test strips that required refrigeration in his car trunk overnight and another shipment of medical products became covered in bird droppings.  The products involved in Javat’s scheme included surgical instruments, professional dental care devices, bandages, and aspirin.The evidence at Soto’s trial demonstrated that Soto knew about Javat’s fraud scheme yet knowingly helped him by supplying paperwork to federal agencies including the FDA to facilitate the re-entry of the diverted products into the United States through the Port of Miami or Miami International Airport.  Chopra, Armando and Daskos also knowingly furthered the scheme by helping to transport the products and remove export labels.U.S. Attorney Fajardo Orshan commended the investigative efforts of the FDA-OCI.  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys David Turken and John Shipley.Related court documents and information may be found on the website of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida atwww.flsd.uscourts.govor athttp://pacer.flsd.uscourts.gov.Component(s):USAO - Florida, Southern"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeWestern District of MissouriFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, October 24, 2019KANSAS CITY, Mo. – The manager of a Wilbur-Ellis Company processing facility in Texas pleaded guilty in federal court today to his role in a multi-million dollar conspiracy to sell adulterated ingredients to pet food manufacturers, for which the company has already paid more than $4.5 million in restitution.William Douglas Haning, 48, pleaded guilty before U.S. Chief District Judge Rodney Sippel in the Eastern District of Missouri to one count of conspiracy to introduce adulterated and/or misbranded food into interstate commerce and one count of money laundering.“For years, William Douglas Haning orchestrated a scheme similar to charging filet mignon prices for ground beef. He unjustly lined his own pockets at the expense of unsuspecting consumers,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Alicia Corder of the FBI St. Louis Division. “Corporate fraud is one of the top white-collar crime priorities for the FBI.”“U.S. consumers – and especially pet owners – look to the FDA to ensure that their pets’ food is not only safe and wholesome, but is also accurately labelled. When criminals introduce adulterated and falsely labelled pet food into the U.S. marketplace, they put the health of companion animals at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L. Grinstead, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Kansas City Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice food manufacturers who put profits ahead of the public health.”By pleading guilty today, Haning admitted that he and others shipped adulterated pet food ingredients and products to pet food manufacturers in Indiana and Connecticut, as well as six co-packers and co-manufacturers in Kansas, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota, over a period of more than six years. Conspirators falsely labeled the shipped product as a single-ingredient premium pet food product, such as chicken meal or turkey meal, but in reality, it was a blend of different ingredients that contained by-products and feathers.Haning was the operations manager of the Wilbur-Ellis facility in Rosser, Texas. Wilbur-Ellis marketed and distributed products and ingredients for use in the pet food industry, including animal proteins used in the manufacture of dog food and cat food. Those sales included both direct sales by Wilbur-Ellis to pet food companies and manufacturers, and sales by Wilbur-Ellis conducted through one or more intermediaries, such as Diversified Ingredients, Inc., a commodities broker and distributor in Missouri whose customers include a number of pet food companies and manufacturers.The fraud scheme began in January 2008, before Wilbur-Ellis purchased the Rosser facility, and continued through May 2014. Wilbur-Ellis purchased the facility in 2011 from Haning and his family members. Haning continued working in his sales and management role as an employee of Wilbur-Ellis. Haning continued to be responsible for buying the food ingredients blended at the Rosser facility and selling the products shipped from the Rosser facility.The adulteration and misrepresentations made the Wilbur-Ellis Rosser facility more profitable over the course of the fraud scheme. This profitability triggered the deferred payment or “earn-out” provisions that were part of the agreement when the facility was sold to Wilbur-Ellis. As a result, Wilbur-Ellis made a $4,608,414 deferred payment for the benefit of Haning and others in 2013, and a $4,391,586 deferred payment for the benefit of Haning and others in 2014. In addition, between July 2011 and May 2014, Haning received cash and other indirect payments.Wilbur-Ellis already has paid $4,549,682 in restitution to the victims of this fraud scheme. Under the terms of today’s plea agreement, the government and the defendant agree that the appropriate disposition of this case is probation for a period of five years. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the United States Probation Office.This case was prosecuted by Special Attorneys to the United States Attorney General Kathleen D. Mahoney and Kyle Bateman. It was investigated by the FBI, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations.Topic(s):Financial FraudComponent(s):USAO - Missouri, Western"

Christensen presided.“Taking a patient’s pain medication to feed an opioid addiction not only puts the patient’s health at risk but also violates the law. Ms. White’s case sends the message that healthcare professionals who use their position to steal opioids will be prosecuted,” U.S. Attorney Alme said.“Patients rely on the knowledge that they will receive FDA-approved medications to manage their pain,” said Special Agent in Charge Lisa L. Malinowski, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Los Angeles Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice healthcare professionals who put their patients’ health at risk by tampering with their pain medications.”In court records filed in the case, the prosecution said White was a nurse at St. Vincent Healthcare when she replaced packaged hydrocodone, a prescription strength pain reliever, with generic over-the-counter acetaminophen on Dec. 6, 2018. The switch was discovered because one of her patients noticed that she was being given different pills by White than by the other nurses. The patient told officials she was in considerably more pain during White’s shift than other nurses’ shifts.When confronted by a manager and the human resources director, White initially said she could not understand why the patient was accusing her, but then admitted she had taken the patient’s pain pills. White said she used the hydrocodone pills.White also admitted to law enforcement agents that she had replaced the hydrocodone pills with an over-the-counter medication and had become addicted to the pills.Assistant U.S. Attorney Tom Godfrey prosecuted the case, which was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration.XXXTopic(s):OpioidsComponent(s):USAO - MontanaContact:Clair Johnson Howard Public Information Officer 406-247-4623"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeWestern District of WashingtonFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, December 6, 2019Fish had been denied entry due to spoilage, was then relabeled and imported into Western WashingtonSeattle – Seven Seas Fish Company, Ltd., of Richmond, B.C., Canada, and a company owner, JOHN HERAS, 78, of Delta, B.C., were sentenced today in U.S. District Court in Seattle to significant monetary fines and periods of probation for importation of previously refused food.  The company and HERAS admit that, between October 2014 and August 2015, they imported more than 9,000 pounds of potentially adulterated fish into the U.S.  The fish had previously been refused entry into the U.S., because the FDA judged samples of the fish too decomposed and putrid.  At the sentencing hearing, Magistrate Judge Mary Alice Theiler said, “this activity leads consumers to be concerned about food safety.”“On two prior occasions, this company put its financial success over the food import regulations and the safety of consumers,” said U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran.  “Now, with a third strike, it is appropriate that the company and its part-owner face a federal criminal conviction and its consequences.”According to records filed in the case, in June 2014, Seven Seas purchased 12,100 pounds of frozen corvina, a white fish similar to sea bass.  The fish was purchased for $36,375 from a seafood company in Mexico.  Seven Seas attempted to have the fish imported into the U.S. at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry.  However, when Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Consumer Safety Officers examined the fish, they determined that one-third of the samples from the shipment were more than 20 percent spoiled.  The shipment was refused entry to the U.S.  However, Seven Seas arranged for the fish to be lawfully shipped through the U.S. to its plant in Richmond, B.C., claiming that the product would be distributed in Canada.After the fish arrived in B.C., HERAS cooked and ate some of the fish and claimed he found nothing wrong with it.  Despite his knowledge that the fish had been refused entry to the U.S., HERAS encouraged others within Seven Seas to sell the fish to customers in Washington State and elsewhere.  Some 9,020 pounds of the fish were imported into the U.S. without the required notice to the Secretary of Health and Human services.The FDA has not found any illness linked to those who consumed the fish.The company was ordered to pay a $150,000 fine within six months of today.  For three years, the company will be on probation with increased scrutiny and surveillance of its imports into the U.S.HERAS will pay a $2,000 fine and will be on probation for one year.  The company claims he no longer has a leadership role at Seven Seas.The company has a tarnished record regarding its compliance with import regulations.  In 2008, Canadian salmon owned by the company was seized because it was sold in violation of Canadian law and the Lacey Act.  The fish, worth nearly $100,000, had been caught by illegal gill netting.  Just one year later, in 2009, Seven Seas was fined $50,000 for selling salmon without notifying regulators after the fish had been detained because it was found unfit for human consumption.  The fish was sold for mink feed, but without the required notice to the agency that had issued the detainer.The case was investigated by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigation, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Homeland Security Investigations.  The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Matthew Diggs.Topic(s):Consumer ProtectionWildlifeComponent(s):USAO - Washington, WesternContact:Press contact for the U.S. Attorney’s Office is Communications Director Emily Langlie at(206) 553-4110orEmily.Langlie@usdoj.gov."

Anderson and Food and Drug Administration-Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI) Special Agent in Charge Special Agent in Charge Los Angeles Field Office Lisa Malinowski.  The sentence was handed down by U.S. Magistrate Judge Joseph C. Spero.  Magistrate Judge Spero also ordered CLC to serve a two-year period of probation during which time CLC will be required to develop and submit to the court an effective compliance and ethics program.CLC, based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and Brea, Calif., pleaded guilty to the charge on September 3, 2019.  According to the plea agreement, CLC admitted that it developed systems for testing human urine for drugs of abuse and then, from 2010 to 2014, marketed the systems, all without FDA approval.“FDA's device approval requirements are designed to ensure the safety and effectiveness of devices used by Americans,” said Special Agent in Charge Malinowski. “Today’s announcement serves as a reminder of the FDA’s continued focus on taking action against companies that put profits ahead of the public health.”CLC admitted that it purchased devices, referred to as reagents, from a company in the Northern District of California, and that it purchased automated photometric chemistry analyzers from a Japanese company and a Chinese company.  CLC admitted that it combined the reagents with the chemistry analyzers and then marketed the combined test system as a product for testing human urine for drugs of abuse.  CLC acknowledged that such a test system required approval by the FDA before being marketed, and that, to obtain approval from the FDA, the sponsor of an application to the FDA for approval would need to demonstrate that there were specific medical indications for which these devise were useful and that the test systems could safely and effectively perform these analyses.  CLC admitted it did not file for FDA approval for its system.CLC was charged by an information on August 26, 2019.  The company was charged with one count of marketing adulterated medical devices, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 331(a) and 333(a)(1).  CLC pleaded guilty to that charge.In addition to the $50,000 fine and the order to develop a compliance and ethics program, Magistrate Judge Spero’s sentence included additional terms that CLC must follow during the two-year probation period.  Among the terms of probation CLC must follow are: (1) to refrain from committing another federal, state, or local crime; (2) to notify the court or probation officer immediately upon learning of any civil litigation, criminal prosecution, or administrative proceeding against the organization; and (3) to submit to unannounced examinations of its books and records by the probation officer or experts engaged by the court.This case is being prosecuted by the Special Prosecutions Section of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District in California.  The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the FDA-OCI with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General.Further Information:Case #: CR 19-406 JCSElectronic court filings and further procedural and docket information are available athttps://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/login.pl.Judges' calendars with schedules for upcoming court hearings can be viewed on the court's website atwww.cand.uscourts.gov.All press inquiries to the U.S. Attorney's Office should be directed to Abraham Simmons at (415) 436-7264 or by e-mail atAbraham.Simmons@usdoj.gov"

Kestel imported raw steroid powders from China and manufactured them into consumable steroid products in a clandestine laboratory in the basement of his home in Alexandria. In addition to steroid products, Kestel concocted homemade versions of pharmaceutical drugs intended to counter the side effects of long-term steroid abuse.Kestel then distributed his homemade steroid products through social media sites including Facebook. After confirming the interest of potential clients in a private Facebook group, Kestel would direct them to a password-protected website where they could place orders and make payments.Kestel utilized an elaborate money laundering scheme to conceal and disguise the nature of the proceeds of his steroid manufacturing and distribution operation.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of GeorgiaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASETuesday, December 10, 2019Final plea of defendants completes federal prosecutionAUGUSTA, GA:  A Georgia man who operated an industrial-scale illegal pill-manufacturing operation has admitted to the main charge in a drug trafficking conspiracy, representing the final guilty plea among the defendants.Walker Christian Forrester, 25, of Loganville, Ga., entered a guilty plea in U.S. District Court in Augusta to Conspiracy to Possess with Intent to Distribute and to Distribute Controlled Substances (Carfentanil, Alprazolam and marijuana), said Bobby L. Christine, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia.The charge carries a penalty of up to life in prison, and there is no parole in the federal system.“This drug trafficking conspiracy distributed massive amounts of dangerous illegal drugs, including deadly synthetic opioids, throughout the streets of Georgia and through the Dark Web,” said U.S. Attorney Christine. “Our federal, state and local law enforcement agencies did outstanding work in investigating and shutting down these merchants of misery and bringing them to justice, where substantial federal prison terms await.”Other defendants who have pled guilty in the conspiracy are:•Kolbie Hadden Watters, 23, of Augusta, Ga., who pled guilty to Conspiracy to Possess with Intent to Distribute and to Distribute Controlled Substances, and Possession of a Firearm in Furtherance of a Drug Trafficking Crime;•Jonathan Britt Lester, 23, of Loganville, Ga.; who pled guilty to Conspiracy to Possess with Intent to Distribute and to Distribute Controlled Substances (Carfentanil, Alprazolam and marijuana);•Armand Sananda Saedi, 28, of Atlanta, Ga., who pled guilty to Conspiracy to Possess with Intent to Distribute and to Distribute Controlled Substances (Alprazolam); and,•Morgan McKenzie Slaton, 23, of Hoschton, Ga., who pled guilty to Conspiracy to Distribute and Possession with Intent to Distribute a Controlled Substance (Alprazolam).According to court documents and testimony, the co-defendants participated in a drug conspiracy dating back to 2016 that imported large amounts of drugs purchased with cryptocurrency on the Dark Web, used industrial-grade machinery to manufacture pills, and sold the drugs on the Dark Web and throughout Georgia. At its peak, the operation produced as many as 200,000 pills per month, yielding profits of up to $18,000 per month.Forrester first came to the attention of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration around Sept. 2017 after he purchased an industrial-grade pill press. Two months later, Forrester, Watters and a juvenile were arrested on state charges in Harlem, Ga., in November 2017 after a traffic stop in which Harlem police officers found more than 5,200 counterfeit Xanax pills, marijuana and a sawed-off shotgun in the vehicle.In addition to charges in the drug conspiracy, Watters and Lester also face state charges in Walton County of felony murder and aggravated assault in the death of Chase David Loffler, 25, whose body was found buried in the backyard of Lester’s Loganville home in April 2018. The two are accused of beating and suffocating Loffler, a suspected co-conspirator, and burying his body in a shallow grave.All six defendants face sentencing at a later date.“Addressing the country’s opioid epidemic continues to be one of DEA’s top priorities,” said Robert J. Murphy, the Special Agent in Charge of the DEA Atlanta Field Division. This defendant ran an industrial illegal pill-manufacturing operation that delivered deadly doses of poison (namely synthetic opioids) to the community. DEA, its law enforcement partners and the U.S. Attorney’s Office will continue to deploy every available resource to stop such criminals like this defendant from distributing these dangerous and potentially deadly substances.”“This case demonstrates the commitment of law enforcement agencies at every level to end an epidemic in our society that is killing our citizens,” said Chris Hacker, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. “The fact that this defendant faces a potential life sentence is an example how serious this crime is and a warning to anyone else who might contemplate doing the same.”“Dark Web purchases provide a false sense of anonymity to criminals who believe their actions will be invisible to law enforcement. These illegally imported pill presses, producing thousands of counterfeit pills an hour, can wreak havoc on a community,” said acting Special Agent in Charge Robert Hammer, who oversees Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) operations in Georgia and Alabama. “These guilty pleas are a testament to the resolve of the entire law enforcement community to combat the opioid crisis and get these dangerous pills off the streets.”“The illegal manufacture and distribution of opioids can result in overdoses and deaths, fueling the national opioid crisis,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin D. Green, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations Miami Field Office. “The FDA remains committed to working with our law enforcement partners to disrupt and dismantle illegal prescription drug manufacturing and distribution networks, including those that import illicit raw materials from overseas to make counterfeit drugs, and misuse the internet to distribute those drugs with reckless disregard of the risk to public health and safety.”“Criminals need to clearly understand that law enforcement agencies across the globe work together daily to root out crime,” said Christopher Grey, spokesperson for the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID). “We share information and continually support each other's investigations. There is no better example of that interagency cooperation than this case and how one piece of information led to more and more evidence to unravel this dangerous drug trafficking conspiracy.”The case was investigated under the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF), the premier U.S. Department of Justice program to dismantle multi-jurisdictional drug trafficking organizations. Agencies involved in the investigation include the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the U.S. Army Criminal Investigative Command (CID), the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the U.S. Marshals Service, and the Harlem Department of Public Safety.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of ColoradoFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, November 13, 2019DENVER – U.S. Attorney Jason R. Dunn announced that former Parker Adventist Hospital Nurse Jessica Sharman, age 36, of Arapahoe County, was sentenced today by U.S. District Court Judge Christine M. Arguello to serve 44 months for stealing fentanyl meant for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients at Parker Adventist.  Sharman appeared at the sentencing hearing free on bond.  She was ordered to report to a Bureau of Prisons facility once one is designated.  During the hearing, the court recognized the seriousness of the offense and the need for deterrence of other healthcare providers in accepting the government’s sentencing recommendation.According to the stipulated facts contained in the plea agreement, Sharman worked as a nurse for various employers until she began working in the ICU at Parker Adventist Hospital in January 2018.  Soon after she started work at Parker Adventist, the defendant used an automated narcotic medication dispensing device known as a Pyxis machine to gain access to the fentanyl.  Only authorized users, which includes nurses, are allowed to use the machine.On April 20, 2018, a routine audit report of access to and utilization of controlled substances from the Pyxis machine flagged Sharman’s access as “red” for high fentanyl use and waste (the disposal of excess fentanyl following physician-ordered patient administration) for the month of March 2018.  The audit for the month of February 2018 flagged Sharman’s access as “yellow,” also for high fentanyl usage.  A review of the Pyxis access records showed a high number of “remove-cancel” transactions, indicating that the defendant had accessed controlled substances from a Pyxis machine but then “cancelled” the transaction, returning the drug to the locked machine.On April 25, 2018, after substantiating the tampering concerns flagged by the audit, Parker Adventist removed all fentanyl from the ICU.  On April 26, 2018, Parker Adventist employees interviewed Sharman.  Based in part on that interview, it was determined that the defendant was stealing fentanyl from the hospital.  She allegedly withdrew the drug from fentanyl cassettes using a sterile syringe and saline flushes.  She sometimes replaced the fentanyl she stole with saline, injecting the saline back into the fentanyl cassette and returning the cassette to the Pyxis machine.  Following her interview, Sharman tested positive for the use of fentanyl.  The hospital terminated Sharman’s employment on April 26, 2018.“Medical professionals who have access to opioids like fentanyl are required to make sure that this powerful medication is provided to patients and is not abused,” said U.S. Attorney Jason Dunn.  “In this case a nurse at a hospital stole fentanyl for her own use.  And perhaps even worse, replaced it with saline, causing unwitting patients to go without necessary medication while believing their pain was being treated.  That is a crime and she has paid the price.”“Jessica Sharman’s actions were callous and selfish.  She chose to steal fentanyl from vulnerable individuals entrusted in her care and use the drugs for herself,” said DEA Denver Division Special Agent in Charge Deanne Reuter.  “Sharman’s blatant disregard for the health and welfare of those under her care is an example of the detrimental effects of opioid addiction and abuse.”“FDA will continue to aggressively pursue those health care practitioners who prey on vulnerable patients by removing their needed medications, especially opioids,” said Charles L. Grinstead, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Kansas City Field Office.  “We remain committed to working with our law enforcement partners to protect the public health and bring to justice those who compromise patients’ health in this manner.”Sharman had previously pled guilty to Tampering with a consumer product.  She was first charged by Information on May 29, 2019.This case was investigated by the FDA OCI and the DEA.

Both Scanlan and Arias are natives of San Diego, California.The ten charges to which Scanlan pleaded guilty are as follows: one count of conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, five counts of distributing fentanyl, one count of selling counterfeit drugs, one count of misbranding drugs, one count of conspiracy to commit international money laundering, and one count of distribution of fentanyl resulting in death.Fentanyl is a highly addictive and oftentimes lethal opioid painkiller.As part of her guilty plea, Scanlan admitted that she and Arias created an account on “Dream Market,” a dark web marketplace where users buy and sell illegal substances and services, and used that account to sell substantial quantities of narcotics while operating under the moniker, “The Drug Llama.” The charged fentanyl distribution conspiracy lasted from October 2016 to August 2018, during which time Scanlan sold approximately 52,000 fentanyl pills throughout the United States.The dark web is an underground computer network that is unreachable by traditional search engines and web browsers, creating a seeming anonymity to users. This false cloak has led to a proliferation of criminal activity on dark web marketplaces, like the one used by Scanlan and Arias.According to court records, Scanlan and Arias made over $100,000 from their dark web drug trafficking and split the money evenly. Scanlan further admitted her participation in an international money laundering conspiracy with Mexican cartel members, as well as her role in aiding and abetting the distribution of fentanyl pills to a woman identified as A.W., who died as a result of taking those pills.Commenting on the case, U.S. Attorney Steven D. Weinhoeft assailed the culture of criminality that exists on the dark web. “Criminals like Melissa Scanlan who recklessly flood our communities with opioids may think they can evade detection in the shadowy corners and back alleys of the internet. But they will find no quarter there. Where they go, we will follow. With the collaboration of outstanding investigators at our partner agencies, we will use every tool and method available to find these people and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law.”“Illicit opioid distribution, whether online or through conventional drug distribution methods, and the resulting overdoses and deaths are a continuing national crisis; those who contribute to that crisis through their illegal actions will be brought to justice,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L. Grinstead, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Kansas City Field Office. “We are fully committed to disrupting and dismantling illegal prescription drug distribution networks that misuse the internet at the expense of public health and safety.”“With accessibility of fentanyl, it is imperative that the Drug Enforcement Administration and its law enforcement partners exploit all distribution avenues utilized by drug traffickers in Scanlan’s case,” stated DEA Special Agent in Charge William J. Callahan of the St. Louis Division. “Scanlan distributed poison in our community that resulted in death and she is now being held accountable.”Scanlan has been held in federal custody since her September 2018 arrest. Her case is set for sentencing before the Honorable Nancy J. Rosenstengel, Chief United States District Judge for the Southern District of Illinois, on February 10, 2020, at 1:30 pm. By law, Scanlan faces no less than 20 years in prison for distributing fentanyl resulting in death. She could receive up to life imprisonment and as much as $10 million in fines.This case was part of a months-long, coordinated national operation involving the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Department of Homeland Security (HSI), United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California, and the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Illinois.

According to the indictment, the defendant sent shipments of the adulterated animal drugs to Mandeville, Louisiana on December 23, 2016; and to Plantation, Florida on July 19, 2017 and October 10, 2019.Vázquez-Díaz was charged with violations of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1341 (mail fraud) for using the United States Postal Service to ship the Blue Magic Formula and Title 18, United States Code, § 1343 (wire fraud) for receiving payments for the shipments of the Blue Magic Formula.  On or about May 8, 2019 the defendant, knowing he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance did knowingly possess a firearm and ammunition, that is, one Beretta Model 84 .380 caliber pistol, two 13-round capacity magazines, and 91 rounds of .380 caliber ammunition, said firearm and ammunition having been shipped and transported in interstate and foreign commerce.“The law requires that drugs, for people as well as for animals, be produced and branded under the most rigorous of quality standards. When individuals fail to exercise the vigilance that the law demands, they will held be accountable,” said United States Attorney, W. Stephen Muldrow.“American pet owners rely on FDA oversight to ensure that the drugs their pets receive are safe, effective, and labeled truthfully and accurately,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin D. Green, FDA-Office of Criminal Investigations, Miami Field Office.  “Today’s announcement should serve as a reminder of FDA’s commitment to pursuing and bringing to justice those who ignore the law by manufacturing and distributing misbranded and adulterated animal drugs.”Assistant United States Attorney Scott Anderson is in charge of the prosecution of the case. If convicted the defendant faces a minimum sentence of one (1) year, and up to twenty (20) years in prison. Indictments contain only charges and are not evidence of guilt. Defendants are presumed to be innocent until and unless proven guilty.# # #Topic(s):Consumer ProtectionPrescription DrugsFirearms OffensesComponent(s):USAO - Puerto Rico"

Davis announced today. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill also sentenced Patterson to serve one year of supervised release following his incarceration, and to pay restitution of $8,200 and a fine of $10,000.According to court records, from March 2014 through April 2015, Patterson knowingly implanted in patients nine pairs of misbranded breast implants that were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The breast implants were shipped to the defendant from China.Patterson provided brochures, handouts, pre-operative worksheets, and sample sizers that misled his patients into believing that they would receive FDA-approved implants, when they did not. For example, on February 27, 2015, Patterson implanted in a patient a misbranded pair of implants from China. Before and after the surgery, Patterson gave the patient labeling for FDA-approved implants, telling her that she received a certain brand of FDA-approved implants. To support this, Patterson sent the patient emails with pictures of the boxes and serial numbers of FDA-approved implants, falsely claiming that was what he implanted in her body. In addition, Patterson changed the patient’s medical records to show that she received a different size implant than was actually used. Patterson changed the size to match the sizing of the FDA-approved implants he told the patient he used.“Members of the community trust their medical providers to use FDA-approved products,” said U.S. Attorney Davis. “Doctors who choose to mislead their patients and use unapproved products will be prosecuted. I commend the efforts of the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations for their work.”“U.S. consumers rely on the FDA to ensure that medical devices, including breast implants, are safe and effective. They also rely on their doctors to properly identify the devices they are using,” said Special Agent in Charge Lisa L. Malinowski, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office. “When medical professionals attempt to put profits above their concern for their patients, we will investigate and bring them to justice.”This case was investigated by Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations with the assistance of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General.# # #Topic(s):Health Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - IdahoContact:CASSIE FULGHUM Public Information Officer (208) 334-1211"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeCentral District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASETuesday, November 19, 2019LOS ANGELES– A resident of the Central Valley town of Orosi was arrested this morning on federal charges related to skin care creams containing dangerous levels of mercury that she sold through advertisements on Facebook with promises that the illegal products could lighten skin color, remove age spots and treat acne.Maria Estela Esparza Magallanes, 30, who allegedly smuggled the creams into the United States from Mexico and marketed the products under the names Crema Esparza and Crema Jimena, was arrested pursuant to a three-count criminal complaint filed on November 13 in United States District Court in Los Angeles. Magallanes is expected to make her first court appearance this afternoon in federal court in Fresno.The complaint, which is the result of an investigation by special agents with the United States Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI), charges Magallanes with selling adulterated and misbranded skin care products and smuggling the unapproved creams into the United States.The affidavit in support of the complaint details how Magallanes sold the smuggled products to two specific victims and an undercover FDA-OCI agent with promises that the creams would treat various skin conditions and would lighten skin color. The Facebook page she used to market the products contained purported testimonials from customers and included before-and-after photos. According to the affidavit, Magallanes sold the creams to the two victims in hand-to-hand transactions in parking lots in Tulare County, and she used the United States Postal Service to ship products on several occasions to the undercover agent.During online communications with one of the victims and the undercover agent, Magallanes said she guaranteed her “natural” products – one of which she claimed contained standard cosmetics ingredients, including lanolin, rose water and bee pollen, and one of which purportedly was made of “stem cells,” the affidavit states. Magallanes allegedly told one victim that the products did not contain mercury and were sold pursuant to a license issued by California.However, the creams allegedly sold by Magallanes to one of the victims and the undercover agent contained dangerous levels of mercury. The second victim was tested, which revealed mercury in her system.In fact, according to the affidavit, a doctor with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, who tested the products sent to the undercover agent, concluded: “The amounts of mercury in these products are very high. There is risk to the user, especially with chronic use, and there is risk to those around/in the user, especially infants and children and unborn babies. It is important to note that infants and children who are held by or rub up against a mother using these products can get it on their skin. The mercury will also evaporate from the product and be inhaled by the user and those around her.”“This defendant allegedly marketed her illegal products on Facebook, intentionally misleading customers with false claims that the products were legal and safe to use,” said United States Attorney Nick Hanna. “These dangerous creams, which were marketed to women in immigrant communities, jeopardized the safety of women and children across California and in several other states.”“Selling products with toxic levels of ingredients with unproven claims to treat medical conditions can put users’ health at serious risk,” said Lisa L. Malinowski, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Los Angeles Field Office. “The FDA will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who put profits above the public’s health and safety.”The FDA has issued cautionary statements about skin lightener and anti-aging treatments being contaminated with mercury.A criminal complaint contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.If she were to be convicted of all three counts in the complaint, Magallanes would face a statutory maximum penalty of 26 years in federal prison.The investigation in this case is being conducted by FDA-OCI.The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has published a wide array of information about mercury-tainted face creams. In the wake of at least one serious injury resulting from mercury poisoning, the CDPH is actively involved in outreach effort to provide educational materials, health information, and community-based resources to support women who may have used mercury face creams and their children who may have been exposed via skin-to-skin contact.This matter is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Amanda M. Bettinelli of the Environmental and Community Safety Crimes Section.Component(s):USAO - California, CentralContact:Thom Mrozek Spokesperson/Public Affairs Officer United States Attorney’s Office Central District of California (Los Angeles) (213) 894-6947Press Release Number:19-236"

Piro, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Miami Field Office.  “It is truly an example of multiple federal and state agencies working together with private industry to take out of circulation thousands of bottles of potentially dangerous drugs, and also disrupt a money laundering scheme that moved millions of dollars a month through South Florida.”“U.S. consumers are put at risk when prescription drugs are diverted from the FDA-regulated supply chain and then returned clandestinely for distribution to the public, as there is no longer any assurance that the products are safe and effective for their intended uses,” said Justin D. Green, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations’ (FDA-OCI) Miami Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who put the public health at risk.”Herrera was arrested this morning and will have his initial appearance Monday afternoon, Oct. 21, 2019, before U.S. Magistrate Judge Alicia M. Otazo-Reyes.  Joles and Salemi will have their initial appearances on later dates.  Alvarez remains a fugitive.The prosecution was part of Operation Southern Hospitality, one of the ongoing efforts by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF), a partnership between federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.  The OCDETF mission is to identify, investigate, and prosecute high level members of drug trafficking and money laundering enterprises, bringing together the combined expertise and unique abilities of federal, state and local law enforcement.U.S. Attorney Fajardo Orshan praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and FDA-OCI.  She also thanked the U.S. Attorney’s Offices for the Northern District of California, the District of Arizona, and the Western District of Washington, the FBI’s Los Angeles, Phoenix and Seattle Field Offices, the U.S. Marshal’s Service in Miami, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Attorney General's Office of Statewide Prosecution in Fort Lauderdale, and Medicaid Fraud Control Unit for their invaluable assistance.The prosecution of this case is being handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Frank Tamen and Walter M. Norkin.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicole Grosnoff is handling the asset forfeiture aspects of this matter.The charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.Related court documents and information may be found on the website of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida atwww.flsd.uscourts.govor onhttp://pacer.flsd.uscourts.gov.Component(s):USAO - Florida, Southern"

Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Nicola T. Hanna of the Central District of California, Assistant Director in Charge Paul Delacourt of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office, Special Agent in Charge Timothy DeFrancesca of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General’s (HHS-OIG) Los Angeles Regional Office and Special Agent in ChargeLisa Malinowski of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations’ (FDA-OCI) Los Angeles Field Office made the announcement.After a six-day trial, Donald Woo Lee, 54, of Temecula, California, was found guilty of seven counts of health care fraud and one count of adulteration of a medical device.  Sentencing has been scheduled for March 19, 2020, before U.S. District Judge George Wu of the Central District of California, who presided over the trial.According to evidence presented at trial, from 2012 to 2015, Lee engaged in a scheme in which he recruited Medicare beneficiaries to his clinics, falsely diagnosed the beneficiaries with venous insufficiency and provided the beneficiaries with medically unnecessary vein ablation procedures.  The evidence further established that Lee billed these unnecessary procedures to Medicare using an inappropriate code in order to obtain a higher reimbursement, a practice known as “upcoding.”  In addition, the evidence showed that Lee repackaged used, contaminated catheters for re-use on patients.  These catheters had been cleared by the FDA for marketing as single-use only.  Lee submitted claims of approximately $12 million to Medicare for the vein ablation procedures he performed, and received $4.5 million as a result, the evidence showed.This case was investigated by the FBI, HHS-OIG and FDA-OCI, and was brought as part of the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, under the supervision of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California.  Trial Attorneys Alexis Gregorian and Emily Culbertson of the Fraud Section are prosecuting the case.The Fraud Section leads the Medicare Fraud Strike Force.  Since its inception in March 2007, the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, which maintains 15 strike forces operating in 24 districts, has charged more than 4,200 defendants who have collectively billed the Medicare program for nearly $19 billion.  In addition, the HHS Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, working in conjunction with the HHS-OIG, are taking steps to increase accountability and decrease the presence of fraudulent providers.Topic(s):Health Care FraudComponent(s):Criminal DivisionCriminal - Criminal Fraud SectionUSAO - California, CentralPress Release Number:19-1,111"

Brady of the Western District of Pennsylvania and United States Attorney William J. Powell of the Northern District of West Virginia announced today. These indictments represent the latest in a series of charges filed since Attorney General Sessions announced the formation of the Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit, a Department of Justice initiative that uses data to target and prosecute individuals that commit opioid-related health care fraud.The defendants named in the indictments are:• Dr. Krishan Kumar Aggarwal, 73, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania, a contractor at RTA in Weirton, West Virginia;• Dr. Madhu Aggarwal, 68, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania, a contractor at RTA in Bridgeville, Pennsylvania;• Dr. Parth Bharill, 69, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a contractor at RTA in Morgantown, West Virginia;• Dr. Cherian John, 65, of Coraopolis, Pennsylvania, a contractor at RTA in Weirton, West Virginia; and• Dr. Michael Bummer, 38, of Sewickley, Pennsylvania, a contractor at RTA in Washington, Pennsylvania.According to the indictments, Redirections Treatment Advocates, LLC, operates Suboxone clinics in several locations in western Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. The indictments allege that the defendants, working as contractors at various locations, created and distributed unlawful prescriptions for buprenorphine, known as Subutex and Suboxone, a drug that should be used to treat individuals with addiction. The defendants are also charged with conspiracy to unlawfully distribute buprenorphine. Finally, the defendants are charged with health care fraud for allegedly causing fraudulent claims to be submitted to Medicare or Medicaid for payments to cover the costs of the unlawfully prescribed buprenorphine.“Today we are facing the worst drug crisis in American history, with one American dying of a drug overdose every nine minutes,” said Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  “It's incredible but true that some of our trusted medical professionals have chosen to violate their oaths and exploit this crisis for profit. Last summer, I sent a dozen of our top federal prosecutors to focus solely on the problem of opioid-related health care fraud in places where the epidemic was at its worst-including Western Pennsylvania. These cases cut off the supply of drugs and stop fraudsters from exploiting vulnerable people. Our prosecutors began issuing indictments back in October, and today we bring even more charges against those who allegedly defrauded the taxpayer while diverting potentially addictive drugs. I want to thank our dedicated AUSAs Robert Cessar and Sarah Wagner, FBI, DEA, our U.S. Attorneys’ offices, FDA, the HHS and Veterans Affairs Inspectors General, IRS, our Postal Inspectors, and all of our state and local partners for their hard work on these cases.\"“Expanding the legitimate use of medication to treat addiction is a critical part of this Administration’s multi-faceted approach to combat the opioid epidemic ravaging our communities,” stated U.S. Attorney Brady. “Yet another vital component is the prosecution of unscrupulous practitioners who abuse their privilege to practice medicine and dispense prescriptions unlawfully. These indictments demonstrate that we remain vigilant in our pursuit of physicians who ignore their oath to do no harm.”“We remain unwavering in our efforts to combat those who violate drug laws and thereby contribute to the crisis of addiction.  I have made clear that a medical degree provides you no protection from prosecution.  We will persevere,” added U.S. Attorney Powell.For each of the defendants, the law provide a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 for each of the counts charging unlawfully dispensing Schedule III controlled substances;  a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a fine of $1 million for each of the counts charging conspiracy to unlawfully dispense a Schedule III controlled substance; and a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a fine of $250,000 for each of the counts charging health care fraud. Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the actual sentence imposed would be based upon the seriousness of the offenses and the prior criminal history, if any, of the defendants.Assistant United States Attorney Robert S. Cessar of the Western District of Pennsylvania and Assistant United States Attorney Sarah E. Wagner of the Northern District of West Virginia are prosecuting these cases on behalf of the United States.The investigation leading to these indictments was conducted by the Western Pennsylvania Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit, which combines personnel and resources from the following agencies to combat the growing prescription opioid epidemic: Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Health and Human Services - Office of Inspector General, Drug Enforcement Administration, Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigations, Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General - Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, Unites States Postal Inspection Service, U.S. Attorney’s Office - Criminal Division, Civil Division and Asset Forfeiture Unit, Department of Veterans Affairs - Office of Inspector General, Food and Drug Administration - Office of  Criminal Investigations and the Pennsylvania Bureau of Licensing, and the U.S. Department of Justice - Criminal Division’s Fraud Section’s Health Care Fraud Unit assisted in the investigation.An indictment is an accusation.

Glassman, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, and Mark S. McCormack, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Metro Washington Field Office, announced the sentence handed down today by U.S. District Judge Michael H. Watson.Crystal Ware, 33, formerly of Shadyside, purchased drugs from China containing Sibutramine and then mislabeled the drugs and sold them at an inflated price. Sibutramine was approved as a treatment for obesity in 1997 but was withdrawn from the U.S. market in October 2010 due to its association with increased strokes and cardiovascular events.In 2015, Ware created the website “www.positivevibespositivelife.com” and registered the trade name “Positive Vibes” in Ohio to promote and sell weight loss products called “Burn, Vibe, Vortex, Slimming V and Fruit Fit” that contained the discontinued Sibutramine.Ware would bulk order the original Sibutramine drugs from China, then relabel and resell them at up to eight times the cost. For example, she purchased 160 bottles of drugs for $5.50 to $10 per bottle from China and resold them for $40 per bottle. Ware received more than $17,000 total from the sale of the misbranded drugs.The FDA Office of Criminal Investigation received information in 2016 that Ware was operating a business that sold weight loss products that contain undeclared pharmaceutical ingredients. FDA laboratory analysis revealed that Ware’s weight loss products contained Sibutramine as an active ingredient.“Distributing foreign prescription drugs of unknown origin and ingredients places U.S. consumers at risk,” said Mark S. McCormack, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Office of Criminal Investigations, Metro Washington Field Office. “In this case, the drug had previously been removed from the U.S. market for safety reasons. We will aggressively pursue and bring to justice those who attempt to subvert FDA requirements, which are designed to ensure the safety and quality of drugs distributed to American consumers.”In November 2018, Ware was charged with and pleaded guilty to receiving misbranded drugs in interstate commerce.She was sentenced today to six months of home confinement, three years’ probation and 80 hours of community service.U.S. Attorney Glassman commended the cooperative investigation by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, as well as Assistant United States Attorney J.

Hickton announced today.United States District Judge Cathy Bissoon first sentenced Zuned Sunesra, of Mumbai, India, to a term of imprisonment of 30 months in prison, a term of supervised release of one year, and forfeiture of $1,200,000 to the United States. In a separate proceeding, Judge Bissoon sentenced Taimur Khan, of Surrey, British Columbia, to a term of imprisonment of time served.According to information presented to the Court, Zuned Sunesra and Khan were members of a conspiracy operating a network of pharmacy websites, including emedoutlet.com. The network of websites was owned by Asian Capital Equities, of which Zuned Sunesra was the director and part owner. Zuned Sunesra was personally engaged in running certain aspects of the websites, which distributed unapproved and misbranded prescription drugs into the United States. The websites often required no prescription from customers, and the websites had no license to operate as online pharmacies under U.S. law. The websites also claimed that the drugs sold were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and were similar to drugs sold in the United States, when in fact that was not true. The drugs sold illegally included Schedule IV and V controlled substances containing the active ingredients of the drugs commonly known as Soma, Provigil, Darvocet, Darvocet-N, Meridia, and Lyrica.Khan’s role was to set up a fake “gift card” company called “mygiftcard.biz,” the purpose of which was to convince credit card processors such as Visa and Mastercard that emedoutlet.com and its affiliate websites were selling gift cards instead of illegal medications. This was necessary because traditional credit card processors attempt to avoid conducting business with illegal enterprises, such as illegal online pharmacies. Khan’s company allowed customers of the pharmacy websites to use their credit cards to purchase gift cards, which appeared to be for merchants such as the Gap and JC Penny. However, rather than redeem the gift cards with these merchants, the customers immediately redeemed the gift cards at emedoutlet.com and the affiliate websites in exchange for illegal drugs. Zuned Sunesra was also directly involved in the processing of customers’ payments to the websites, as well the transfer of funds gained from the customers’ payments to accounts outside of the United States.U.S. Attorney Hickton commended the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations and the Internal Revenue Service – Criminal Investigation for conducting the investigation in this case. Assistant United States Attorneys Eric Rosen, Jonathan Ortiz, and Conor Lamb prosecuted this case on behalf of the government.Topic(s):Drug TraffickingComponent(s):USAO - Pennsylvania, Western"

Bean, Filet O’Fish, Rug Doctor, Squeaky Wheel, Dingo Boney, Coco Puff, and Harry Potter, among others.The jury also found that Chin and Thomas dispensed these prescription drugs with the intent to defraud and mislead government regulators. Specifically, the evidence demonstrated that NECC repeatedly took steps to shield its operations from regulatory oversight by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by claiming to be a pharmacy dispensing drugs pursuant to valid, patient-specific prescriptions. The jury heard evidence that the fake prescriptions approved by Chin and Thomas allowed NECC to operate as an unregulated drug manufacturer.Today, Alla Stepanets, 38, of Framingham, was sentenced to one-year of probation by Judge Stearns. In December 2018, Stepanets, a licensed pharmacist, who worked as another verification pharmacist at NECC, was convicted of six counts of dispensing drugs without valid prescriptions. Specifically, Stepanets was convicted of approving shipments of drugs for patients with names such as Wonder Woman, Fat Albert, Bud Weiser, Samuel Adams, Hindsight Man, Betty Ford, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Calvin Klein and Jennifer Lopez, among others.In June 2017, Barry Cadden, the former owner and head pharmacist for NECC, was sentenced to nine years in prison and three years of supervised release after being convicted of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud and mislead. In January 2018, Glenn Chin, NECC’s former supervisory pharmacist, was sentenced to eight years in prison and two years of supervised release after being convicted of 77 counts.  With the convictions of Chin and Thomas yesterday, a total of 13 NECC defendants have been convicted of 178 charges.United States Attorney Andrew E.

Mendez to three years in prison for causing misbranded drugs to be introduced into interstate commerce, U.S. Attorney McGregor W. Scott announced.U.S. Attorney Scott stated: “Cavell thought he could trick regulators. He was wrong. It’s past time for him to learn that we will ensure that these types of schemes are stopped to keep the community safe.”“Drugs that are produced and distributed outside of the FDA’s oversight present the prospect of harm to consumer health,” said Special Agent in Charge Lisa L. Malinowski, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office. “The FDA will continue to work to prevent the illegal online sales of dangerous, unapproved drugs and we’re committed to protecting consumers from criminals who put profits above the health and safety of the U.S. public.”“Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) will continue to identify, investigate and bring to justice individuals, like Cavell, who traffic unsafe products into the hands of American consumers that could cause serious and irreversible harm,” said Ryan L. Spradlin, Special Agent in Charge, Homeland Security Investigations (San Francisco and Northern California). “Individuals who choose to circumvent drug regulations should continue looking over their shoulders. HSI and our law enforcement partners are committed to uncovering even the most secret of schemes.”San Francisco Division Inspector in Charge Rafael Nunez of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service stated, “Postal Inspectors have worked closely with the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our partners in law enforcement in operations just like this one to keep dangerous drugs out of the communities we serve.”According to court documents, between 2015 and 2017, Cavell, with others, developed a scheme to market and sell a drug, 2,4-Dinitrophenol (also known as DNP), as a weight loss drug and “fat burner” despite knowing that DNP is not approved by the FDA as a substance for human consumption. Cavell sold DNP in pill form and called it a fertilizer — a term under which is it legally sold in other circumstances.Cavell admitted that he controlled websites that marketed the drug as a supplement while at the same time discouraging its use. He proceeded to sell DNP pills on another website, thefertizerwarehouse.com, for the purpose of misleading U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulators.DNP has been commercially used to manufacture dyes and wood preservatives, as a fertilizer, and as a pesticide. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has declared that DNP is too toxic to be used for human consumption under any circumstances.According to court documents, Cavell collected at least $763,000 for compounding cheap fertilizer into pills for human consumption.This case was the product of an investigation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, Drug Enforcement Administration, Homeland Security Investigations, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeCentral District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, May 15, 2019LOS ANGELES– Three companies and five executives have agreed to plead guilty to federal criminal charges alleging that they purchased and resold millions of dollars’ worth of pharmaceutical-grade erectile dysfunction pills that were falsely labeled as male herbal remedies.The anticipated guilty pleas are in relation to three cases filed today in United States District Court against distributors of the misbranded drugs.In one of the new cases, Ronald Daniel Scott, a.k.a., “Danny Scott,” 49, of Stevenson Ranch, agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce. Scott is the chief executive officer of Premiere Sales Group, Inc., a Santa Clarita-based company that also agreed to plead guilty to the same charge. Scott admitted in a plea agreement filed today that, from 2013 until early 2017, he purchased at least 1.7 million male sexual enhancement pills for $3.8 million from John Seil Lee, 40, of Walnut, the manufacturer of the pills who pleaded guilty in February to a series of felony offenses related to his illegal business.Two other federal cases filed today charged the following six defendants with misdemeanor charges of conspiring with Lee to distribute his misbranded erectile enhancement drugs:• Contenda Health LLC, a Southern Pines, North Carolina-based company;• Chase Evan Cranford, 36, of Raleigh, North Carolina, the owner of Contenda Health LLC;• Randall Cranford, 65, of Pinehurst, North Carolina, who is Chase Cranford’s father and who assisted him at Contenda Health;• Eldorado Trading Company II, Inc., a distributor of adult toys and other sexual products, based in Broomfield, Colorado;• Jon Vogt, 58, of Erie, Colorado, the director of purchasing for Eldorado Trading; and• Dennis Jones, 65, of Thornton, Colorado, the senior buyer at Eldorado Trading.According to court documents, Lee smuggled powder Tadalafil – the prescription drug used to treat erectile dysfunction and sold under the brand name Cialis – from China. Lee then manufactured the powder Tadalafil into pills that he sold to distributors across the United States. In order to boost sales, Lee made the pills with up to 14 times the level of Tadalafil contained in Cialis. Lee sold at least $11 million worth of pills across the United States – under names such as “X Again,” “X Monster” and “Royal Master” – with labels that did not disclose the presence of Tadalafil and falsely stated that no prescription was necessary.In their plea agreements, Contenda Health and the Cranfords admitted to purchasing more than 1.4 million misbranded pills from Lee for approximately $2.1 million, which they resold to retail locations across the United States.Eldorado Trading, Jones, and Vogt admitted in their plea agreements to buying hundreds of thousands of misbranded pills from Lee, which Eldorado Trading resold for a profit of at least $215,000.Once they enter their guilty pleas, the five businessmen charged today each will face a statutory maximum sentence of one year in federal prison. The three corporate entities will face up to five years of probation, as well as monetary sanctions of up to $200,000 in fines or twice the gross gain resulting from the criminal offenses.The arraignments in these cases have been scheduled for June 24 for the defendants in the Eldorado Trading case, June 27 for the defendants in the Premiere Sales case, and July 15 for the defendants in the Contenda Health case.The FDA’s approval of Cialis is limited to the use under the supervision of a licensed professional. Due to toxicity and other potentially harmful effects – including life-threatening drops in blood pressure, loss of vision, loss of hearing and prolonged, painful erections that can result in permanent injury – drugs similar to Cialis are not safe for use except under the supervision of a medical practitioner.The investigation into these cases was conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations and the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations.The cases are being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Matthew W. O’Brien of the Environmental and Community Safety Crimes Section.Hidden active pharmaceutical ingredients have been identified in products promoted not only for sexual enhancement, but also for bodybuilding, pain relief and weight loss. The FDA has issued hundreds of public warnings and recall announcements related to these types of fraudulent products. The FDA’s Tainted Products database can help consumers identify some of these potentially harmful products. Even if a product is not included in the list, consumers should be cautious about using certain products, especially those promoted for sexual enhancement, weight loss, bodybuilding and pain relief.Component(s):USAO - California, CentralContact:Ciaran McEvoy Public Information Officer United States Attorney’s Office Central District of California (Los Angeles) (213) 894-4465Press Release Number:19-094"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeCentral District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, July 3, 2019LOS ANGELES– A doctor who operates a medical clinic in West Hollywood where he specializes in treating HIV patients has been taken into custody pursuant to federal charges that allege he engaged in a long-running scheme to defraud health insurance companies in connection with the brand-name human growth hormone Serostim.James T. Lee, 71, of West Hollywood, was taken into custody on Tuesday afternoon after being escorted from Austria by federal law enforcement agents.After a federal grand jury returned a 10-count indictment on June 6, Lee was arrested in Vienna at the request of the United States. Lee subsequently waived extradition and agreed to return to the United States.The indictment against Lee charges him with one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud, six counts of health care fraud, one count of making false statements relating to health care matters, and two counts of witness tampering.The indictment was unsealed this morning and Lee’s arraignment on the charges is scheduled for this afternoon in United States District Court in downtown Los Angeles.Lee allegedly engaged in a scheme to divert Serostim – an injectable human growth hormone that is FDA-approved for HIV-positive patients – from legitimate HIV patients to other people who purchased the drug for its purported anti-aging properties. The Food and Drug Administration has approved Serostim for use only by HIV patients with wasting or cachexia who are also receiving antiretroviral therapy.According to the indictment, from at least May 2011 until February 2019, Lee wrote prescriptions for Serostim to HIV patients, who obtained the drugs and used their Medicare Part D benefits to pay for the drugs. Lee then then illegally purchased the Sersotim back from patients, so that he could re-sell the Serostim. Lee allegedly re-sold the Serostim for a significant profit to other patients who were not HIV-positive, and who used the human growth hormone to build muscle and for other cosmetic purposes.The indictment alleges a second part of the scheme in which Lee allegedly submitted claims to health insurance companies for Serostim injections, claims that were fraudulent because Lee did not actually provide the Serostim injections to the patients at his office. According to the indictment, many of the patients did not receive the full amount of Serostim that Lee billed to the insurance companies, or they received Serostim that Lee had purchased from other patients.Lee allegedly twice engaged in witness tampering during meetings with a patient that were recorded without Lee’s knowledge. During those meetings, Lee encouraged the patient to provide false information to federal agents who were investigating the case. Lee coached the patient to lie about the Serostim scheme, including by falsely stating that kickback payments from Lee were merely overpayments from the insurance companies, according to the indictment.During the course of the conspiracy, Lee and his co-conspirators submitted at least $14.2 million in claims to the insurance companies for Serostim injections, which resulted in payments of approximately $5.9 million, according to the indictment. The scheme allegedly defrauded Health Net, which is a private health benefit plan, and the Government Employees Hospital Association, which is a health benefit plan that provides health insurance coverage to certain former United States government employees.Medicare paid at least $1.4 million based on Serostim prescriptions that were issued by Lee and filled by patients who sold at least some of the drugs to Lee.An indictment contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty.Each of the health care fraud counts charged in the indictment carries a statutory maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. The false statement counts carries a statutory maximum sentence of five years in prison. The witness tampering counts each carry a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The indictment also contains criminal forfeiture allegations that seek the forfeiture of the ill-gotten gains derived from the criminal offenses.This case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations; and the Office of Personnel Management, Office of Inspector General.The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Alexander F. Porter of the Major Frauds Section.Component(s):USAO - California, CentralContact:Thom Mrozek Spokesperson/Public Affairs Officer United States Attorney’s Office Central District of California (Los Angeles) (213) 894-6947Press Release Number:19-138"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of MassachusettsFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, May 30, 2019BOSTON – Two former clean room pharmacists at New England Compounding Center (NECC) were sentenced this week in federal court in Boston in connection with the 2012 nationwide fungal meningitis outbreak.Gene Svirskiy, 38, of Ashland, Mass., was sentenced yesterday by U.S. District Court Judge Richard G. Stearns to 30 months in prison and one year of supervised release. Christopher Leary, 34, of Shrewsbury, Mass., was sentenced today by Judge Stearns to two years of probation, of which the first eight months will be in home confinement with electronic monitoring, and 100 hours of community service.In December 2018, Svirskiy and Leary were convicted with three other NECC co-defendants following an 8-week trial. Svirskiy, a supervising pharmacist at NECC, was convicted of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, 10 counts of mail fraud, and two counts of introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce with intent to defraud or mislead.  Leary was convicted of three counts of mail fraud, one count of introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce with intent to defraud or mislead, and two counts of introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce.In the fall of 2012, more than 793 patients in 20 states were diagnosed with fungal infections after receiving injections of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) manufactured by NECC. Of those 793 patients, more than 100 patients have now died. The fungal meningitis outbreak was the largest public health crisis ever caused by a pharmaceutical drug.The criminal investigation revealed that in addition to the contaminated MPA, NECC’s clean room pharmacists, including Svirskiy and Leary, knowingly manufactured and sold hundreds of other substandard drugs that were made in an unsafe manner and in insanitary conditions. The evidence presented at trial demonstrated that NECC’s pharmacists, including Svirskiy and Leary, failed to properly sterilize and test NECC’s drugs and failed to wait for test results before sending the drugs to customers. Svirskiy and Leary approved the use of expired drug ingredients, and the mislabeling of drugs in order to deceive customers. Svirskiy also supervised a pharmacy technician whose license had been revoked. To conceal the technician’s presence inside the clean room, Svirskiy directed the technician to fraudulently complete paperwork without his name appearing and to physically leave the clean room and hide in the warehouse when regulators would inspect the facility.The insanitary conditions at NECC included, among other things, a lack of proper cleaning, fraudulently completed cleaning logs, and positive environmental monitoring hits for mold and bacteria inside NECC’s cleanrooms throughout 2012. Specifically, NECC recorded alert or action-level environmental monitoring hits for mold and bacteria during thirty-seven out of thirty-eight weeks prior to the shutdown in 2012. Despite these repeated action-level environmental monitoring hits and the presence of fungal blooms inside the clean room, neither Svirskiy, nor Leary, nor anyone else at NECC took any remedial action to eliminate the mold and bacterial contamination, or stop the drug production.In June 2017, Barry Cadden, the former owner and head pharmacist for NECC, was sentenced to nine years in prison and three years of supervised release after being convicted of 57 counts. In January 2018, Glenn Chin, NECC’s former supervisory pharmacist, was sentenced to eight years in prison and two years of supervised release after being convicted of 77 counts.  In total, 13 NECC defendants have been convicted of 178 charges.United States Attorney Andrew E.

Glassman, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, and Mark S. McCormack, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Metro Washington Field Office, announced the sentence handed down today by U.S. District Judge Michael H. Watson.Crystal Ware, 33, formerly of Shadyside, purchased drugs from China containing Sibutramine and then mislabeled the drugs and sold them at an inflated price. Sibutramine was approved as a treatment for obesity in 1997 but was withdrawn from the U.S. market in October 2010 due to its association with increased strokes and cardiovascular events.In 2015, Ware created the website “www.positivevibespositivelife.com” and registered the trade name “Positive Vibes” in Ohio to promote and sell weight loss products called “Burn, Vibe, Vortex, Slimming V and Fruit Fit” that contained the discontinued Sibutramine.Ware would bulk order the original Sibutramine drugs from China, then relabel and resell them at up to eight times the cost. For example, she purchased 160 bottles of drugs for $5.50 to $10 per bottle from China and resold them for $40 per bottle. Ware received more than $17,000 total from the sale of the misbranded drugs.The FDA Office of Criminal Investigation received information in 2016 that Ware was operating a business that sold weight loss products that contain undeclared pharmaceutical ingredients. FDA laboratory analysis revealed that Ware’s weight loss products contained Sibutramine as an active ingredient.“Distributing foreign prescription drugs of unknown origin and ingredients places U.S. consumers at risk,” said Mark S. McCormack, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Office of Criminal Investigations, Metro Washington Field Office. “In this case, the drug had previously been removed from the U.S. market for safety reasons. We will aggressively pursue and bring to justice those who attempt to subvert FDA requirements, which are designed to ensure the safety and quality of drugs distributed to American consumers.”In November 2018, Ware was charged with and pleaded guilty to receiving misbranded drugs in interstate commerce.She was sentenced today to six months of home confinement, three years’ probation and 80 hours of community service.U.S. Attorney Glassman commended the cooperative investigation by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, as well as Assistant United States Attorney J.

Hale for two counts of introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce and one count of using a fictitious name to conduct an unlawful business.Dhaval Jerambhai Dholaria, 39, of Houston, Texas, pleaded guilty to two counts of introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce and one count of using a fictitious name to conduct an unlawful business in August of 2019.  Dholaria was originally indicted on June 7, 2017.“Put the families of our district at risk through your greed, as in this case, and expect to reside in federal prison” said U.S. Attorney Russell Coleman.“Distributing foreign prescription drugs of unknown origin and ingredients instead of FDA-approved drugs places the U.S. public health at risk,” said Mark S. McCormack, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Office of Criminal Investigations, Metro Washington Field Office.  “We will aggressively pursue and bring to justice those who attempt to subvert FDA requirements, which are designed to ensure the safety and quality of drugs distributed to American consumers.”According to the plea agreement, from March 19, 2016, to March 23, 2016, Mr. Dholaria illegally shipped zolpidem tartrate (Ambien), a Schedule IV controlled substance used for sleep problems, from a location in Texas to a P.O. Box in Oldham County, Kentucky.  The medication he shipped was misbranded, in that it was dispensed without a prescription and its labeling did not contain required directions for use.  He shipped this medication with the intent to defraud and mislead, by avoiding the FDA requirements for prescription drugs.To accomplish his introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce, Dholaria used a stamps.com shipping account registered in the name of “Sam H,” a false name he used for the purpose of conducting his unlawful business by means of the Postal Service.During the course of the investigation, federal agents seized over thirty (30) packages of prescription pills sent to Dholaria from India.  Those packages contained approximately:  52,000 tramadol pills (a Schedule IV opioid), 2,300 diazepam pills (a Schedule IV anti-anxiety medication, also known as Valium), 2,200 zolpidem tartrate pills, 1,200 clonazepam pills (a Schedule IV anti-anxiety medication, also known as Klonopin), and 1,500 carisoprodol pills (a Schedule IV muscle relaxant, also known as Soma).  Agents also seized nearly thirty (30) packages containing nearly 5,000 prescription pills of various types that agents witnessed Dholaria placing in the mail for delivery to United States residents.  Based on shipping records it appears that Dholaria shipped tens of thousands of prescription pills throughout the United States before he was caught.The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys David Weiser and Madison Sewell, and was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, the United States Postal Service, and Homeland Security Investigations.####Component(s):USAO - Kentucky, Western"

Gillette, 31, of Albany, Ohio, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to having a medicated calf slaughtered with the intention of selling it as beef for human consumption. The calf was contaminated with Gentamicin, which is not approved for use in cattle.Benjamin C. Glassman, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, and Mark S. McCormack, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Field Office announced the plea entered into today before U.S. District Judge Timothy S. Black.According to the statement of facts in this case, since 2009, Gillette has operated as a livestock dealer and hauler as the owner of Cory Gillette Farm in Athens County.Gillette transported a calf from Southern Ohio to a slaughter facility in Addison, Ill., where it was intended to be sold as beef for human consumption. The calf was slaughtered and subject to random inspection. During that inspection, the calf tested positive for Gentamicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic.When an investigator from the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations interviewed Gillette about the contaminated calf, Gillette lied and said he purchased the calf at a livestock auction in Zanesville, Ohio. In fact, he had not purchased the calf there, and misled investigators in an attempt to impede their ability to trace the contamination back to its source.“As part of his plea, Gillette admitted he often bought injured, ill and potentially medicated animals at a discounted price with the intention of selling the animals to slaughter facilities and maximizing his profit,” said U.S. Attorney Glassman.“The FDA, in partnership with the USDA, is vigilant in keeping antibiotics and other residual animal drugs out of the human food supply in the United States by carefully monitoring food-producing animals,” said Special Agent in Charge McCormack. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who put public health at risk by selling food-producing animals that do not meet federal standards.”Gillette was charged by a bill of information in September 2018. He pleaded guilty to one count of introducing adulterated food into interstate commerce, a crime punishable by up to one year in prison, and one count of making false statements to federal agents, a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.U.S. Attorney Glassman commended the investigation of this case by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations and Assistant United States Attorney Ebunoluwa A.

Brady announced.The one-count superseding Indictment, returned on March 26, named Lancelot De Montsegur, aka Patrice Berthome, 38, of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Steven Juliver, 54, of Point Roberts, Washington, as defendants.According to the superseding Indictment, De Montsegur and Juliver were involved in a complex fraud that involved fraudulently processing credit card payments. The credit card companies will not allow their products and services to be used to pay for certain precluded activities, including the on-line sales of recreational and designer drugs, kratom, and CBD oil. De Montsegur and Juliver participated in a conspiracy designed to conceal from the credit card companies the fact that De Montsegur, Juliver and their co-conspirators used their products and services to pay for precluded activities and to subvert the internal controls the credit card companies had in place to detect and prevent this type of activity.The fraud involved establishing shell corporations and websites associated with the shell companies that falsely claimed that they sold a product other than designer drugs, kratom, or CBD oil. The conspirators then applied for PayPal, Stripe, Square, or merchant accounts from the credit card companies in the names of the shell corporations and the fake web sites. Once the accounts were established, they were used to process payments for designer drugs, kratom, or CBD oil. Additionally, the conspirators arranged for the credit card statements sent to the consumers to have the names of the shell corporations and telephone numbers. The conspirators set up a telephone bank to receive calls from customers questioning billings on their credit card statements, and the conspirators explained to the customers the true nature of the transactions in hopes of avoiding charge-backs that could cause the credit card companies to question the legitimacy of the transactions.The law provides for a maximum total sentence of 30 years in prison, a fine of $1,000,000 or both. Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the actual sentence imposed would be based upon the seriousness of the offense and the prior criminal history, if any, of the defendant.Assistant United States Attorneys Brendan T. Conway and Jeffrey R. Bengel are prosecuting this case on behalf of the government.The Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations and Homeland Security Investigations conducted the investigation leading to the Superseding Indictment in this case.A superseding indictment is an accusation.

Brady announced today.Senior United States District Judge Donetta W. Ambrose imposed the sentence on Emil Koledin, a/k/a Butch, age 61.According to information presented to the court, Koledin operated a business out of Hermitage home called Koledin Enterprises, Inc., that sold various illegal drugs manufactured primarily in Russia and China though the website awakebrain.com. Koledin sold the drugs as \"nootropics\", which he described as \"Smart drugs, memory enhancers, neuro exchangers, and intelligence enhancements.\" He falsely represented these drugs as legal to sell in the United States. In fact, these are drugs that were illegally imported into the United States and illegal to sell in the United States because they are not approved for sale by the Food and Drug Administration, the products do not contain the properly labeling, directions for use and warnings, and because they were manufactured in unapproved facilities. Some of the illegal drugs Koledin was selling include the following: Adrafinil, a/k/a Noofon; Bromantane; Coluracetam; Etifoxine, a/k/a Stresam; Noopept; Piracetam, a/k/a Nootropil; Phenylpiracetam, a/k/a Phenotropil; Sunifiram; Theanine; and Tianetine.Assistant United States Attorney Brendan T.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeCentral District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEMonday, August 26, 2019SANTA ANA, California– A Santa Ana man who admitted his role in a scheme that used fentanyl and other synthetic opioids to manufacture and sell counterfeit pharmaceutical pills designed to look like brand-name oxycodone pills was sentenced this morning to 210 months in federal prison.Wyatt Pasek, 22, who lived in the penthouse of a luxury high-rise in Santa Ana until his arrest last year, was sentenced by United States District Judge James V. Selna.Pasek – who used in the moniker “oxygod” when soliciting customers in online marketplaces, and posted images and videos of himself to social media platforms under the moniker Yung10x – pleaded guilty last November to participating in a narcotics-trafficking conspiracy, being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, and money laundering.Pasek “caused highly toxic drugs to be mixed into counterfeit pharmaceuticals at a clandestine laboratory in a highly populated residential and commercial area, the Newport Beach Peninsula, and sold the drugs in massive quantities for approximately one year,” prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memorandum filed with the court.According to court documents, Pasek and two co-defendants obtained fentanyl and a similar drug called cyclopropyl fentanyl through internet from Chinese suppliers, used a pill press to make counterfeit pills, and distributed the narcotics through the mails, often arranging sales through a darknet marketplace. Pasek also sold the counterfeit pills in hand-to-hand transactions.The other two defendants in this case – Duc Cao, 22, of Orange, and Isaiah Suarez, 23, of Newport Beach – also pleaded guilty and were sentenced earlier this year by Judge Selna to 87 months and 37 months in federal prison, respectively.“The defendants in this case played a direct role in fueling this nation’s opioid crisis,” said United States Attorney Nick Hanna. “The use of powerful drugs such as fentanyl in counterfeit pills intentionally made to look like less-lethal opioids demonstrates a complete disrespect for human life.”When the three defendants were arrested in April 2018, authorities seized a pill press lab in Suarez’s apartment, along with bags that contained nearly 100,000 counterfeit oxycodone pills, hundreds of bogus Xanax pills, nearly six kilograms of fentanyl and fentanyl analogues, and bundles of cash.During a six-month investigation led by the Drug Enforcement Administration, Internal Revenue Service – Criminal Investigation, and the Costa Mesa Police Department, authorities recovered blue pills stamped “A 215” that resemble 30 mg. oxycodone pills. In the weeks leading up the arrests in this case, investigators intercepted 20 packages that were being sent to Pasek’s customers.“Had federal agents not intercepted these packages, they would have resulted in substantial counterfeit opioids containing fentanyl and fentanyl analogues to be distributed to New York, California, Massachusetts, Illinois, Texas, Florida, Nevada, Georgia, Utah, Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, Colorado, Alabama, and Nebraska,” according to the sentencing memo.Pasek, who has three prior drug-related convictions, apologized during today’s hearing. “I know I have affected countless [people],” he said. “I can’t even imagine how much damage I have done.”As part of his plea agreement, Pasek agreed to forfeit to the government a number of items seized in relation to his arrest in April 2018: more than $21,000 in cash; jewelry, including a Silver Royal Offshore watch with diamonds, and a gold and diamond Bitcoin necklace; two gold bars seized from his mother’s residence; and thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency/Bitcoin he possessed in his Blockchain wallet.This matter was investigated by the Drug Enforcement Administration, IRS Criminal Investigation, the Costa Mesa Police Department, the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Food and Drug Administration – Office of Criminal Investigations, the United States Marshals Service, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.This case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Brett A.

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, May 8, 2019Matthew Dailey, 36, of Royal Oak, Michigan, was sentenced today to two years in prison for illegally importing kratom—a powerful psychoactive substance—and selling it unlawfully through unapproved claims that it could treat serious diseases and medical conditions, including opiate withdrawal symptoms, the Department of Justice announced.Dailey pleaded guilty on Jan. 8 in the Eastern District of Michigan to one count of introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce and one count of importing merchandise contrary to law. As part of his plea, Dailey agreed to forfeit $1,000,000 in illegal proceeds.  Today, Judge Judith E. Levy of the Eastern District of Michigan sentenced Dailey to serve two years in prison, followed by three years supervised release.Dailey was the owner and operator of Nomad Botanicals, an online business that sold kratom, which is made from the leaves of a tree indigenous to Southeast Asia, to consumers throughout the United States. In pleading guilty, Dailey admitted that he sold kratom with the intention that it be used as a drug to treat a variety of diseases, including chronic pain, Lyme disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and fibromyalgia. Dailey also widely distributed kratom as an opiate withdrawal drug, and as a substitute for drugs of abuse and prescription pills. Dailey further admitted that to circumvent the United States Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) regulation of drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), Dailey knowingly and fraudulently portrayed his kratom products to the FDA as “incense,” “paint pigment,” and other substances not intended for human consumption. By deceiving the FDA in this manner, Dailey was able to import several tons of kratom into the United States.“We will not tolerate the importation or misbranding of drugs and other products without proper regulatory approvals,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division.  “The Department of Justice will continue to work with the FDA to ensure that drug distributors do not put consumers at risk by circumventing their obligations under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.”As part of his plea agreement, Dailey further admitted that he repackaged and labeled the illegally imported kratom in his residence, which he did not register as a facility that manufactured, prepared, and processed drugs, as required under the FDCA. Dailey then sold and shipped kratom products to consumers throughout the United States for use as a drug without providing any directions for use, such as indications, dosage instructions, methods of administration, or contraindications.This case was prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Clint Narver and Jocelyn Hines of the Department of Justice’s Consumer Protection Branch. The prosecution was assisted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Adriana Dydell of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan.

        "content": "U.S. Department of JusticeFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASETuesday, April 30, 2019The Justice Department announced today that US WorldMeds LLC (USWM) has agreed to pay $17.5 million to resolve allegations that it violated the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729 et seq., by paying kickbacks to patients and physicians to improperly induce prescriptions of its drugs, Apokyn® and Myobloc®. USWM is a pharmaceutical manufacturer headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky.“The Department of Justice is committed to ensuring that physicians’ and patients’ selection of medications is not influenced by improper financial considerations,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. “The nation’s health care programs and taxpayers deserve health care companies that play by the rules, including the Anti-Kickback Statute.”When a Medicare beneficiary obtains a prescription drug covered by Medicare Part D, the beneficiary may be required to make a partial payment, which may take the form of a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible (collectively “copays”). Congress included copay requirements in the Medicare program, in part, to encourage market forces to serve as a check on health care costs, including the prices that pharmaceutical manufacturers can demand for their drugs. Under the Anti-Kickback Statute, a pharmaceutical company is prohibited from offering, directly or indirectly, any remuneration — which includes paying patients’ copay obligations — to induce Medicare patients to purchase the company’s drugs.USWM substantially increased the price of Apokyn in or around January 2012, a decision that resulted in a corresponding increase to Medicare patients’ copays — which for many patients exceeded $5,000 per year. The United States alleged that, from the time of the price increase through June 30, 2013, USWM illegally paid Medicare patients’ Apokyn copays through a third-party foundation. During the relevant time period, USWM allegedly knew it was the only donor to the foundation’s Parkinson’s Disease fund and that virtually all of the fund’s donations were spent on Medicare Apokyn patients. The United States alleged that these payments represented illegal inducements to patients in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act.The United States also alleged that USWM paid kickbacks to two physicians to induce prescriptions of Apokyn and Myobloc. Specifically, the United States alleged USWM paid these physicians excessive speaking and consulting fees and provided impermissible entertainment, such as lavish meals, private plane rides, and all-expense paid trips with their spouses (including trips to the Kentucky Derby).“Pharmaceutical companies and other healthcare providers that pay kickbacks to patients and physicians to improperly induce drug prescriptions drive up the costs of health care and divert critical resources from the Medicare program,” said U.S. Attorney John H. Durham for the District of Connecticut. “This case originated with the filing of whistleblower lawsuits currently pending in the District of Connecticut, and the whistleblowers will be handsomely rewarded for exposing this scheme. We encourage all individuals who are aware of fraud against the government to come forward. The Connecticut U.S. Attorney’s Office will continue to pursue companies and providers that defraud federal health care programs.”Contemporaneously with the False Claims Act settlement, USWM has entered into a “Corporate Integrity Agreement” with the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General. The five-year CIA requires, among other things, that USWM implement measures designed to ensure that its promotional activities and any arrangements and interactions with third-party patient assistance programs comply with the law. In addition, the CIA requires reviews by an independent review organization, compliance–related certifications from company executives and Board members, and the implementation of a risk assessment and mitigation process.“Kickback schemes can undermine our healthcare system, compromise medical decisions, and waste taxpayer dollars,” said Phillip Coyne, Special Agent in Charge, Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “We will continue to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for subverting the charitable donation process in order to circumvent safeguards designed to protect the integrity of the Medicare program. Simply put, OIG’s goal is to ensure that patients receive the appropriate treatments and therapies according to their medical needs, without the corrupt or profit-driven influence of drug manufacturers.”\"Ensuring the integrity of TRICARE, the U.S. Defense Department's health care program for military members and their dependents, is a top priority for the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS),\" stated Leigh-Alistair Barzey, Special Agent-in-Charge, DCIS Northeast Field Office.  \"The settlement agreement announced today is the direct result of a joint investigative effort and is demonstrative of the DCIS' commitment to work with its law enforcement partners to investigate kickback schemes that divert funds from TRICARE and ensure that TRICARE patients properly receive the care and treatment that they deserve.\"The False Claims Act allegations resolved by the settlement were originally brought in lawsuits filed by whistleblowers under the qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act, which allow private parties to bring suit on behalf of the government and to share in any recovery. The whistleblowers will receive $3,150,000.00 as their share of the recovery.The investigation was conducted by the Civil Division of the Department of Justice; the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Connecticut; the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General; the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations; and Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service.The cases are captioned United States ex rel.

In January 2019, Keith Kovaleski was charged in a federal complaint with conspiracy and was released on bail. Both defendants will be arraigned at a date to be determined.According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:The FDA is responsible for enforcing the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), a law intended to assure that drugs are safe, effective, and bear accurate labeling containing all required information. The FDA regulates the manufacture, labeling, and distribution of all drugs shipped or received in interstate commerce.From May 2014 to January 2019, the Kovaleskis owned and operated AA Peptide LLC, a/k/a All American Peptide (AAP). AAP used its website to market and distribute substances primarily used by bodybuilders and others engaged in weight training to enhance performance and mitigate the side effects of performance-enhancing substances.The AAP website included a bogus legal disclaimer that its products were intended for laboratory research use only, and not as drugs or food. The Kovaleskis employed the bogus “research chemicals” disclaimer to conceal that they and others were distributing misbranded drugs and unapproved new drugs for use by their customers.The Kovaleskis, though AAP, sold products including: (1) prescription drugs, such as tadalafil, the active ingredient in Cialis; (2) SARMS, used by body-builders as an alternative to steroids; (3) peptides, also used as performance-enhancing substances; and (4) other drugs that were not peptides or SARMS, and had not been approved for human use, for example, clenbuterol, a drug sold in foreign markets but not approved by the FDA.The Kovaleskis failed to provide adequate directions for use for these products, such as frequency of administration and other dosage information.The Kovaleskis used their South Amboy basement as a manufacturing facility to make and label AAP products, including homemade capsules containing baking soda and tadalafil.  The Kovaleskis sold tadalafil capsules that contained significantly higher dosages of the active ingredient than the highest recommended dosage.The Kovaleskis earned more $2.5 million through the sale of misbranded and unapproved new drugs.The conspiracy charge carries a maximum potential penalty of up to five years in prison.  Each count of introduction of misbranded drugs in interstate commerce, introduction of unapproved new drugs in interstate commerce, and operating an unregistered drug manufacturing facility carries a maximum potential penalty of three years in prison. Each charge also carries a maximum potential fine of up to $250,000 or twice the gross pecuniary gain or loss.U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito credited special agents of the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, New York Field Office, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey J.

Hur and Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack of the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Field Office.“Offering U.S. consumers misbranded drugs online is a dangerous practice that places the public at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office. “We will continue to protect U.S. consumers by investigating and bringing to justice those who defraud the public and circumvent federal law regarding the approval, manufacture, and distribution of human drugs.”According to his plea agreement, from September 2016 through June 2017, Sambuca distributed anabolic steroids and other body-enhancing injectable drugs to consumers seeking to enhance their physiques.  Sambuca admitted that he knew the anabolic steroids and other drugs that he distributed were misbranded within the meaning of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) because they bore false labeling and lacked adequate directions for use, warnings, and other information such as expiration dates.  The anabolic steroids that Sambuca distributed included Testosterone, Nandrolone, Stanozolol, Oxandrolone, and Oxymetholone, all of which are controlled substances.Sambuca distributed anabolic steroids and other misbranded drugs for a company known as Dynasty Lab, which he knew sought buyers for these products by placing advertisements on bodybuilding websites and online forums, and by sending blast e-mail advertisements to customers.In September 2016, a law enforcement officer acting in an undercover capacity received an unsolicited e-mail from Dynasty Labs in his “inbox” on a website known for promoting unapproved and misbranded underground drug lab sales.  The message from Dynasty Labs promoted a “7 day super sale.”  In response, on September 12, 2016, the undercover officer contacted Dynasty Labs via undercover e-mail and received a reply e-mail the same day promoting, among other drugs, Viagra, Cialis, Trestalone, Dihydroboldenone.  A subsequent e-mail from Dynasty Labs requested that the undercover officer use a specific e-mail provider for “Security,” and undercover officer thereafter registered an undercover e-mail address at that provider.On November 1, 2016, the undercover officer sent an e-mail to Dynasty Labs ordering anabolic steroids and other misbranded drugs. Dynasty Labs replied with specific payment instructions, including that the payment be made in cash and be sent through the mail.The undercover officer made the payment as requested and as a result, on November 14, 2016, Sambuca mailed a package from Nevada to Maryland containing, among other items, seven vials labeled “TEST SUSTANON 350MG” containing Testosterone, and seven vials labeled “DECA DURABOLIN 400MG” containing Nandrolone.  The steroids were misbranded within the meaning of the FDCA.On May 15, 2017, the undercover officer e-mailed Dynasty Labs and ordered numerous anabolic steroids and other drugs.  On May 20, 2017, Dynasty Labs replied with specific mailing instructions that directed the undercover officer to send $715 in cash to “Steven Thompson” at an address in Henderson, Nevada.  On May 22, 2017, the undercover officer sent the cash as directed.Sambuca admitted that, as a result, on June 16, 2017, he again mailed a package from Nevada to the undercover officer in Maryland containing, among other things, one ziplock bag of white powder labeled “DBOL 5g” containing Stanozolol, Oxandrolone, and Oxymetholone; one ziplock bag of white powder labeled “CLOMID” containing Stanozolol; and one vial labeled “SUSTANON 350MG/ML . . . 100cc” containing Testosterone.  The steroids were misbranded within the meaning of the FDCA.Sambuca faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for distribution of anabolic steroids, and a maximum of three years in prison for introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce.  U.S. District Judge Deborah K.

Kennedy, Jr. announced today that Kelsey A. Mulvey, 27, of Grand Island, NY, was charged by criminal complaint with illegally obtaining controlled substances by fraud, tampering, and violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The charges carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.Assistant U.S. Attorney Joshua A. Violanti, who is handling the case, stated that according to the complaint, the defendant, a former nurse at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, used her position as a nurse to tamper with and steal vials of medication and pills, such as hydromorphone (Dilaudid), methadone, and oxycodone, all Schedule II controlled substances, and lorazepam, a Schedule IV controlled substance. Mulvey took the vials of medication from the Pyxis machine, an automated medication dispensing system. As a nurse, the defendant had access to the Pyxis system.Mulvey was placed on administrative leave on June 28, 2018, after a large number of transactions associated with the defendant in the Pyxis system were identified as “cancelled removed,” indicating that the Pyxis machine drawer for the selected medication was accessed but the transactions were cancelled. The complaint states that Roswell Park inferred that Mulvey had removed and replaced controlled substances with water from the Pyxis machines. Many of these transactions took place on floors and/or wings where the defendant was not assigned and did not have patients. Mulvey accessed the Pyxis machines during her scheduled shifts, on days she was not scheduled to work, and on three dates of scheduled vacation. Between February and June 2018, the defendant is accused of failing to properly administer medication for 81 patients.In June and July 2018, there was a span of waterborne infections at Roswell Park. The complaint states that six patients allegedly became infected as a result of the defendant replacing medications with contaminated water.The defendant resigned her position in Lieu of Termination on July 13, 2018.“Once again, this case illustrates the destructive power of opioid addiction,” noted U.S. Attorney Kennedy. “In this case, however, the harm caused by defendant’s actions resulted not only in harm to herself but in harm to some of the most compromised and vulnerable individuals in our community—those members of our community receiving cancer treatments. If we fail to take action to protect the most vulnerable among us, then we fail as a government.”“Patients deserve to have confidence that they are receiving the proper treatment from those entrusted with providing their medical care,” said Special Agent-in-Charge Jeffrey J. Ebersole, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, New York Field Office. “As part of the FDA’s comprehensive work to address the opioid epidemic, we will continue to hold medical personnel accountable when they take advantage of their unique position and tamper with drugs needed by their patients, especially when such tampering could cause unnecessary pain and suffering.”“This is not the first time we have investigated and charged a healthcare professional who suffers from addiction,” said FBI Buffalo Special-Agent-in-Charge Gary Loeffert. “Accessibility to these highly sought-after drugs makes it easier for medical professionals to feed their addiction. Ms. Mulvey's actions not only put her own health at risk, but also the wellbeing of dozens of patients.”The defendant made an initial appearance this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeremiah J. McCarthy.The complaint is the culmination of an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey Ebersole; the Federal Bureau of Investigation, under the direction of Special Agent-in-Charge Gary Loeffert; the New York State Department of Education, Office of Professional Discipline; and the New York State Attorney General’s Office, under the direction of Attorney General Letitia James.The fact that a defendant has been charged with a crime is merely an accusation and the defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty.# # # #Topic(s):OpioidsHealth Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - New York, WesternCONTACT: Barbara BurnsPHONE: (716) 843-5817FAX #: (716) 551-3051"

U.S. Senior District Court Judge Mark L. Wolf scheduled sentencing for Aug. 6, 2019.On Nov. 16, 2016, Langlois, then a registered nurse, tampered with bottles of liquid morphine that doctors had prescribed for two elderly hospice patients under his care at a Lowell nursing home. In each instance, Langlois took the liquid morphine, a schedule II narcotic used to treat pain, for his own use and then replaced it with saline or Benadryl in an attempt to cover up his crime. As a result his conduct, the patients in Langlois’s care received a less potent dose of the painkiller than they had been prescribed.On or about April 3, 2017, Mr. Langlois diverted for his own use liquid morphine from a bottle prescribed to an elderly hospice patient under his care at a Melrose nursing home. To conceal his wrongful conduct, Mr. Langlois falsely represented in the medical file of one of his patients, and in the nursing home’s Medication Administration Record, that the liquid morphine for that patient was pure, when that was not in fact the case.The charge of tampering with a consumer product provides for a sentence of no greater than 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. The charge of acquiring a controlled substance provides for sentence no greater than four years in prison, one year of supervised release, and a fine of $250,000. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.United States Attorney Andrew E.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of MassachusettsFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, June 5, 2019Company admits to illegal promotion of Subsys, a powerful opioid painkillerBOSTON – Opioid manufacturer Insys Therapeutics agreed to a global resolution to settle the government’s separate criminal and civil investigations, the Department of Justice announced today. As part of the criminal resolution, Insys will enter into a deferred prosecution agreement with the government, Insys’s operating subsidiary will plead guilty to five counts of mail fraud, and the company will pay a $2 million fine and $28 million in forfeiture. As part of the civil resolution, Insys agreed to pay $195 million to settle allegations that it violated the False Claims Act.Both the criminal and civil investigations stemmed from Insys’s payment of kickbacks and other unlawful marketing practices in connection with the marketing of Subsys.  Insys’s drug Subsys is a sublingual fentanyl spray, a powerful, but highly addictive, opioid painkiller. In 2012, Subsys was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of persistent breakthrough pain in adult cancer patients who are already receiving, and tolerant to, around-the-clock opioid therapy.Today, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts filed an Information charging Insys and its operating subsidiary with five counts of mail fraud. According to the charging document, from August 2012 to June 2015, Insys began using “speaker programs” purportedly to increase brand awareness of Subsys through peer-to-peer educational lunches and dinners. However, the programs were actually used as a vehicle to pay bribes and kickbacks to targeted practitioners in exchange for increased Subsys prescriptions to patients and for increased dosage of those prescriptions. One practitioner targeted by Insys was a physician’s assistant who practiced with a pain clinic in Somersworth, N.H.  During the first year that Subsys was on the market, the physician’s assistant did not write any Subsys prescriptions for his patients. In May 2013, the physician’s assistant joined Insys’s sham speaker program knowing that it was a way to receive kickbacks for writing Subsys prescriptions. After joining the sham speaker program, the physician’s assistant wrote approximately 672 Subsys prescriptions for his patients – many of which were medically unnecessary – and in turn, received $44,000 in kickbacks from Insys.As part of the criminal resolution, Insys agreed to a detailed statement of facts outlining its criminal conduct with respect to the illegal marketing of Subsys. Insys will enter into a five-year deferred prosecution agreement, while Insys’s operating subsidiary will plead guilty to five counts of mail fraud pursuant to the plea agreement that will be filed in the District of Massachusetts. According to the terms of the criminal resolution, Insys will pay a criminal fine of $2 million and forfeiture of $28 million. The Court has not yet scheduled the plea hearing. Last month, five former Insys executives were convicted after trial of racketeering conspiracy in connection with the marketing of Subsys. In total, eight company executives have now been convicted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Massachusetts for crimes relating to the illegal marketing of Subsys.In April 2018, the United States intervened in five qui tam lawsuits accusing Insys of violating the False Claims Act. In its civil complaint, the United States alleged that Insys, headquartered in Arizona, paid kickbacks to induce physicians and nurse practitioners to prescribe Subsys for their patients. Many of these kickbacks took the form of speaker program payments for speeches to physicians that were, in fact, shams; jobs for the prescribers’ relatives and friends; and lavish meals and entertainment. The United States also alleged that Insys improperly encouraged physicians to prescribe Subsys for patients who did not have cancer, and lied to insurers about patients’ diagnoses in order to obtain reimbursement for Subsys prescriptions that had been written for Medicare and TRICARE beneficiaries.Insys also entered into a 5-year Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) and Conditional Exclusion Release with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General. Because of the extensive cooperation provided by Insys in the prosecution of culpable individuals and its agreement to enhanced CIA requirements, OIG elected not to pursue exclusion of Insys at this time. The CIA includes several novel provisions, including enhanced material breach provisions, designed to protect federal health care programs and beneficiaries.  In addition, Insys admitted to a Statement of Facts and acknowledged that the facts provide a basis for permissive exclusion. OIG did not release its permissive exclusion authority, as it generally does for CIA parties in False Claims Act settlements. Instead, OIG will provide such a release only after Insys satisfies its obligations under the CIA.“This criminal resolution today with Insys, coupled with the convictions of the 8 executives, shows this Office’s resolve to hold both corporations and individuals accountable for their crimes,” said United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Andrew E. Lelling. “For years, Insys engaged in prolonged, illegal conduct that prioritized its profits over the health of the thousands of patients who relied on it. Today, the company is being held responsible for that and for its role in fueling the opioid epidemic.  This global resolution is the culmination of years of work by prosecutors and agents, and these successful prosecutions and civil enforcement efforts should be a model for confronting corporate criminal activity.”“The opioid epidemic is a plague that has devastated communities and ravaged families across this country,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. “The Department of Justice is committed to using the legal tools at our disposal to combat the illegal marketing and distribution of opioids, including fentanyl. Today’s settlement sends a strong message to pharmaceutical manufacturers that the kinds of illegal conduct that we have alleged in this case will not be tolerated. I want to assure the families and communities ravaged by this epidemic that the Department of Justice will continue to act forcefully to hold opioid manufacturers accountable for their actions.”“Today’s settlement underscores our determination to hold opioid manufacturers accountable for pushing these highly addictive narcotics on the public via kickbacks to doctors and nurses, and other illegal means,” said United States Attorney for the Central District of California Nick Hanna. “Our goal is to bring about an end to the tragic epidemic of opioid addiction and to go after those who profit from that epidemic.”“Paying bribes and providing other incentives to prescribe opioids with little regard to patient welfare surely signals a company is more concerned with profits than patients,” said Christian J. Schrank, Special Agent in Charge for the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  “Today’s settlement reaffirms our commitment to ensuring that companies pay a very heavy price for attacking vital government health programs.”“The announced settlement is a vivid example of the Department of Defense's dogged efforts to protect the integrity of the U.S. military’s health care system and its beneficiaries,” said Bryan D. Denny, Special Agent in Charge of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Western Field Office. “DCIS remains committed to working with its law enforcement partners and the U.S. Attorney’s Office to combat health care fraud, especially when pharmaceutical companies use taxpayers’ dollars to induce physicians with bribes and kickbacks to prescribe their drugs for unauthorized off-label usage that may very well endanger the recipient's health and safety.”“I applaud the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney for their continued efforts to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable to the American taxpayer,” said Vice Adm. Raquel Bono, director of the Defense Health Agency. “The efforts of the Department of Justice safeguard the health care benefit for our service members, veterans and their families. The Defense Health Agency continues to work closely with the Justice Department, and other state and federal agencies to investigate all those who participated in fraudulent practices.”The allegations resolved by the civil settlement stem from five lawsuits that were filed under the qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions of the False Claims Act, which permit private citizens to bring suit on behalf of the United States for false claims and share in any recovery.  The lawsuits are: United States, et al., ex rel. Guzman v. Insys Therapeutics, Inc., et al., 13-cv-5861; United States ex rel. Andersson v. Insys Therapeutics, Inc., 14-cv-9179; United States ex rel. John Doe and ABC, LLC v. Insys Therapeutics, Inc., et al., 14-cv-3488; United States ex rel. Erickson and Lueken v. Insys Therapeutics, Inc., 16-cv-2956; and United States ex rel. Jane Doe, et al. v. Insys Therapeutics, et al., 16-cv-7937.  The whistleblowers’ share of the settlement announced today has not yet been determined.These matters were handled by the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts; the Justice Department’s Civil Division; the United States Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California; and the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General. Investigations were conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Field Division; the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Regulatory Affairs; the Drug Enforcement Administration, New England Field Division; Department of Defense, Defense Criminal Investigative Service; U.S. Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security Administration, Boston Regional Office; U.S. Postal Inspection Service’s Boston Division; United States Postal Service, Office of Inspector General, Northeast Area Field Office; Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Inspector General, Criminal Investigations Division; Office of Personnel Management, Office of Inspector General; and the Defense Health Agency.Attachment(s):Download Insys_CIA.pdfDownload Insys_Civil_Settlement_Agreement.pdfDownload Insys_Criminal_Information.pdfDownload Insys_DPA.pdfDownload Insys_Plea_Agreement.pdfTopic(s):Health Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - Massachusetts"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeMiddle District of LouisianaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, May 15, 2019BATON ROUGE, LA – United States Attorney Brandon J. Fremin announced today that U.S. District Judge Lance M. Africk sentenced ALVIN WATTS, III, a 37-year-old resident of Addis, Louisiana, to 108 months in federal prison for his conviction after a 2-day jury trial on a multiple count indictment.  All counts involved stolen HIV medication, and included WATTS’ conspiracy to possess, transport, and traffic in the medication; trafficking and transporting the stolen medication; and receiving and possessing stolen medication.As the evidence at trial demonstrated, WATTS was a co-owner and pharmacist of Doc-Your-Dose Pharmacy in Grosse Tete, Louisiana.  In 2013, WATTS organized a scheme to purchase black market HIV pharmaceutical drugs that had been stolen from the Washington, D.C. Department of Health Pharmacy Warehouse intended for indigent HIV patients in Washington, D.C.  WATTS sent two of his employees to D.C. on multiple occasions between June and September of 2013 to purchase the stolen medication and transport it back to his Louisiana pharmacy.  As a result, WATTS profited approximately $640,000.00 by dispensing the stolen medication, as opposed to selling legally-obtained medication.WATTS’ criminal conduct became known as the result of a traffic stop near Chattanooga, Tennessee, in which his couriers were stopped for speeding.  During the stop, officers discovered a significant quantity of stolen HIV medication in the trunk of their vehicle. The investigation identified WATTS’ criminal conduct along with the conduct of four co-conspirators who were indicted and subsequently pled guilty for their involvement in this scheme and have been sentenced.During today’s hearing, Judge Africk highlighted WATTS’ greed, extreme depravity in selling stolen HIV medications that were intended for indigent HIV patients in the D.C. area, and the fact that he obstructed justice in attempting to prevent a government witness from testifying.U.S. Attorney Fremin stated, “Medical professionals like the defendant cannot be allowed to profit by dispensing stolen medication intended for indigent patients. The actions of this defendant are a great disservice to the pharmacists and medical professionals in our community who ensure that patients’ well-being is their highest priority.  I commend the superb efforts of prosecutors and federal and state local law enforcement partners who played a critical role in investigating and prosecuting this complex and important matter.”“The health of patients is jeopardized when prescription drugs are diverted from the legal supply chain. When this happens, there is no longer any assurance that the products are safe and effective for their intended uses,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge H. Peter Kuehl, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Miami Field Office. “We will continue to investigate these types of criminal acts and bring to justice those who put the public health at risk.“I applaud my Medicaid Fraud Control Unit and our federal law enforcement partners for their efforts to end this criminal conspiracy,” said Attorney General Landry. “We will remain steadfast in our commitment to find, arrest, and prosecute Medicaid fraudsters.”This matter was investigated by the United States Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations and Louisiana State Attorney General’s Office’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, with assistance from the State of Tennessee 10th Judicial District Drug & Violent Crime Task Force.  The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Peter Smyczek and Paul Pugliese.Component(s):USAO - Louisiana, Middle"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeCentral District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEMonday, August 19, 2019LOS ANGELES– A Walnut man was sentenced today to 100 months in federal prison for illegally importing from China and selling $11 million worth of pharmaceutical-grade erectile dysfunction drugs that were falsely marketed as herbal remedies for men, some of whom suffered permanent injuries after consuming them.John Seil Lee, 41, was sentenced by United States District Judge Percy Anderson, who ordered him remanded into federal custody. Judge Anderson – who also ordered Lee to pay more than $552,000 in restitution to his victims, including men who were injured by Lee’s misbranded pills – remarked in court on Lee’s “callousness” and how Lee’s “scheme has literally ruined lives.”“It’s obvious to me,” Judge Anderson said, “that this defendant has little or no respect for the law or the harm he caused numerous victims.”On February 27, Lee pleaded guilty to three felony counts of conspiracy, importing contraband into the United States, and filing a false tax return.Lee’s companies – KHK International Trade Enterprise, Inc., and SHH World Trading Enterprises, Inc. – each were sentenced today to five years’ probation. KHK was fined $100,000 and SHH was ordered to pay its victims $115,484 in restitution. Lee’s companies each pleaded guilty in February to two felony counts of introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce.From 2011 through early 2017, Lee illegally imported shipments of powder Tadalafil – a prescription drug used to treat erectile dysfunction and sold under the brand name Cialis – from suppliers in China. Lee then manufactured the powder Tadalafil into at least 5.5 million pills that he sold to distributors across the United States. In order to boost sales, Lee made the pills with up to 14 times the level of Tadalafil contained in Cialis.Lee sold at least $11 million worth of pills across the United States – under names such as “X Again,” “X Monster” and “Royal Master” – with labels that did not disclose the presence of Tadalafil and falsely stated that no prescription was necessary, according to court documents. Lee also continued selling the pills despite FDA announcements that the pills were tainted because they contained undeclared Tadalafil. In order to evade federal regulators, Lee relabeled the tainted pills in response to FDA announcements about their safety, the information states. For example, in August 2016, after the FDA announced that SHH’s “One More Knight” pills contained undisclosed Tadalafil, Lee rebranded the same pills as “Own the Knight” and continued selling them.After Lee closed SHH following the execution of federal search warrants in February 2017, he helped his friend Jin Su Park set up RNG Global Management and Trading Group to operate as a copycat business, according to Park’s plea agreement and statements made in court today. Park took 14,000 of Lee’s pills, rebranded them as “EEZZY UP PLATINUM,” and sold them to Lee’s former distributors across the country. EEZZY UP’s packaging also failed to disclose that the pills contained Tadalafil.The FDA’s approval of Cialis is limited to the use under the supervision of a licensed professional. Due to toxicity and other potentially harmful effects – including life-threatening drops in blood pressure, loss of vision, loss of hearing and prolonged, painful erections that can result in permanent injury – drugs similar to Cialis are not safe for use except under the supervision of a medical practitioner.In addition to the convictions of Lee, KHK, and SHH, federal prosecutors have obtained 13 guilty pleas from individuals and companies who conspired with Lee to distribute his misbranded erectile dysfunction drugs. These defendants are scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Anderson over the next several months.The investigation into these cases was conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations, the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations and IRS Criminal Investigation.The cases are being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Matthew W. O’Brien of the Environmental and Community Safety Crimes Section.Hidden active pharmaceutical ingredients have been identified in products promoted not only for sexual enhancement, but also for bodybuilding, pain relief and weight loss. The FDA has issued hundreds of public warnings and recall announcements related to these types of fraudulent products. The FDA’s Tainted Products database can help consumers identify some of these potentially harmful products. Even if a product is not included in the list, consumers should be cautious about using certain products, especially those promoted for sexual enhancement, weight loss, bodybuilding and pain relief.Component(s):USAO - California, CentralContact:Ciaran McEvoy Public Information Officer United States Attorney’s Office Central District of California (Los Angeles) (213) 894-4465Press Release Number:19-166"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of West VirginiaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, October 3, 2019CHARLESTON, W.Va. – A former Parkersburg physician pled guilty to a drug conspiracy, announced United States Attorney Mike Stuart. Paul W. Burke, 68, pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute controlled substances not for legitimate medical purposes in the usual course of professional medical practice and beyond the bounds of medical practice.Burke worked at the Charleston HOPE Clinic, a chronic pain clinic, from April 2014 through September 2014. Burke admitted that the owner of the HOPE Clinic recruited him to work there despite Burke being primarily an emergency room doctor and surgeon with little experience in dealing with chronic pain patients and no training in prescribing schedule II narcotics for the treatment of chronic pain. The owner explained to Burke that narcotics auditors employed by PPPFD who were “former DEA Agents,” would screen customers for abuse, addiction, and diversion prior to the customer ever seeing him. In approximately April 2014, Burke began working at the Charleston HOPE Clinic. Burke understood at the time he was contracted that the purpose of HOPE Clinic was to provide pain customers with oral opiate pain medicine. As the practice manager and owner both knew, however, Burke had no background or specialized training in chronic pain management.Burk admitted that when he started working at the HOPE Clinic, it became apparent that some of the customers were not getting properly evaluated prior to the doctors writing them prescriptions for opioids, that the customers’ files were poorly kept and had little relevant medical information in them. Burke admitted that many of the patients came to the HOPE Clinic from out of state, and most customers paid in cash. He also admitted that he often received a bonus on top of his hourly pay that was clearly based on the number of paying customers at the Clinic. Despite all of these red flags, Burke admitted that he continued to work at the HOPE Clinic and continued to write customers prescriptions for Schedule II narcotics. For example, Burke admitted that he and other doctors at HOPE Clinic should not have prescribed Schedule II opioid medications to customer S.W. Doctors at the HOPE Clinic, including Burke, prescribed oxycodone to S.W., and Burke admitted those prescriptions were not for a legitimate medical reason in the usual course of professional practice and were beyond the bounds of medical practice. Between December 2012 and September 2014, eight different doctors at the HOPE Clinic wrote her prescriptions for a total of 720 oxycodone 10 mg pills and 2,670 oxycodone 15 mg pills. During that less than two-year period, S.W. took eight drug tests and failed every single one. Burke admitted to only recognizing that S.W. failed three drug tests. Between December 2012 and September 2014, no one at the HOPE Clinic discussed drug addiction, drug abuse, drug treatment or drug diversion with S.W. On August 25, 2014, despite the clear evidence of abuse and diversion, Burke admitted to writing S.W. a prescription for 150 oxycodone 15 mg and 60 Percocet 10 mg.“As I’ve said many times, medical professionals who prey on individuals struggling with substance use disorder to line their own pockets will be held accountable,” said United States Attorney Mike Stuart. “A drug dealer in a lab coat is still just a drug dealer. We will work with our law enforcement partners to remove them from our communities to protect West Virginia families.”“Patients struggling with opioid addiction are someone’s parents, children, friends or loved ones, and it’s our responsibility to protect them from bad actors who seek to profit from their struggle” said Maureen R. Dixon, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General-Philadelphia Regional Office (HHS-OIG). “Today’s conviction shows we are holding bad actors accountable and working to prevent further harm to patients.”“Distributing addictive opioids for illegitimate purposes poses a serious threat to patients and public health and will not be tolerated,” said Mark S. McCormack, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Office of Criminal Investigations, Metro Washington Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice unscrupulous actors who unlawfully distribute these dangerous drugs to the American public.”Burke faces up to five years in prison when sentenced on January 30, 2020.The investigation was conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG), the Internal Revenue Service – Criminal Investigations, the Food and Drug Administration - Office of Criminal Investigations, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the West Virginia State Police, the Kentucky State Police, the Beckley Police Department, the Virginia State Police, the Charleston Police Department, and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Grimm sentenced Daniel Mark Wilkerson, age 45, of Fort Washington, Maryland today to 66 months in federal prison, followed by five years of supervised release, for possession with intent to distribute more than 100 kilograms of marijuana, and in a separate case for conspiring to steal prescription drugs from federal military hospitals.  Judge Grimm also ordered that Wilkerson pay restitution of $4,450,679.60, and forfeit $16,320.44.The sentence was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Robert K. Hur; Special Agent in Charge Robert Craig of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service - Mid Atlantic Field Office; and Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack of the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations-Metro Washington Field Office.Wilkerson admitted that from January 2008 to June 11, 2013, he conspired with Rodger Gurdon, Issa Wasco Koroma, and others to steal Norditropon, Humatrope, Somatotropin, Botox and other branded varieties of human growth hormone from pharmacies located at Fort Belvoir Community Hospital in Fort Belvoir, Virginia; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (Walter Reed) in Bethesda, Maryland; and the former Walter Reed Medical Center (Old Walter Reed) in Washington, D.C.  They re-sold the stolen pharmaceuticals for profit.Gurdon and Koroma were pharmacy technicians at Old Walter Reed.  From January 2008 until the closure of Old Walter Reed, Gurdon stole Humatrope from the pharmacy and sold it to Wilkerson for no less than $100 per box.  The cost to the government for each box of Humatrope was approximately $300.  Between January 1, 2009 and June 30, 2011, the conspirators stole more than $2.1 million worth of Humatrope from Old Walter Reed.  After Old Walter Reed closed, Gurdon was assigned to work in the pharmacy at Fort Belvoir.  At Fort Belvoir Gurdon resumed his theft of HGH, which he distributed to Wilkerson in exchange for payment.  Between August 2011 and June 2013, Wilkerson and Gurdon stole more than $850,000 worth of pharmaceuticals from Fort Belvoir.From January 2008 through June 2013, Koroma was a pharmacy technician at Walter Reed.  Beginning no later than the middle of 2011, Koroma began to steal brands of human growth hormones and Botox from the pharmacy at Walter Reed at Gurdon’s request.  Koroma met with Gurdon on a regular basis to exchange the drugs for payment from Gurdon.  Gurdon then distributed the drugs to Wilkerson.  From August 2011 to June 2013, Koroma and Gurdon stole over $1.3 million worth of pharmaceuticals from the pharmacy at Walter Reed.Wilkerson shipped the stolen HGH and Botox to individuals in California, who paid Wilkerson by cash that was mailed to him from California, as well as by wire transfers from a bank in Mexico.The total loss to the United States caused by Wilkerson, Gurdon, and Koroma was at least $4,467,000.According to Wilkerson’s plea agreement in a second and unrelated case, on August 11, 2017, law enforcement officers executed a search warrant for a crate that had been shipped from California to a business in Baltimore and discovered 384 pounds (174 kilograms) of marijuana, worth more than $1 million.  Undercover officers conducted surveillance at the business in an effort to determine the identity of the person to whom the crate had been sent.  During their surveillance, Wilkerson, who was driving a red Hyundai, was seen driving in the vicinity of the business, and at one point, got out of his car and asked an officer if he was an employee at the business. Later that day, the crate containing the marijuana was claimed by a man who arrived at the business in a pick-up truck with two other men.  The crate was placed into the truck and the men left the business, followed by law enforcement.  Officers stopped the vehicle, detained the men, and seized the crate containing the marijuana.  At the same time, another officer stopped Wilkerson, who was driving his Hyundai nearby.  Wilkerson admitted that the crate of marijuana was his and that he had hired the individuals to assist him in picking-up and transporting the crate.Roger George Gurdon pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal government property, interstate receipt of stolen property, and conspiracy to distribute marijuana, and was sentenced to 70 months in federal prison.  Issa Wasco Koroma, age 62, of Springdale, Maryland, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal government property and theft of medical products and was sentenced to five years in prison.United States Attorney Robert K. Hur praised the DCIS and FDA-OCI for their work in the investigation.  Mr. Hur thanked Assistant United States Attorney Thomas P.

Peter Kuehl, Acting Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI), Miami Field Office, and Thomas W. South, Deputy Assistant Inspector General for Investigations, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Office of Inspector General (OPM-OIG), made the announcement.Dr. Alap Shah, 44, of Columbus, Georgia, was sentenced to 36 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release. Shah was also ordered to pay a $300 special assessment and restitution in the amount of $55,300. On January 8, 2019, after a week-long jury trial, Shah was convicted of one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and receive health care kickbacks and two counts of receiving kickbacks. According to the evidence introduced at trial, the defendant was a podiatrist in Columbus, Georgia. In February 2014, Shah was approached by Paul Meek and Gary Small, the owners of PGRX, a marketing company that paid kickbacks to medical professionals in return for the referral of patients with prescriptions to their company for expensive compounded medications. PGRX would then refer these patients to Atlantic Pharmacy, a pharmacy that submitted claims to TRICARE, a health insurance program that provides low cost health insurance to members of the U.S. Armed Forces.According to the evidence introduced at trial, during the course of the conspiracy, Shah received $55,300 in kickback payments for the referral of patients to PGRX. These referrals, in turn caused Atlantic Pharmacy to submit claims for medications that cost up to $4782.00 for a one- month supply. The evidence showed that PGRX and Shah signed phony Medical Director and speaker agreements in order to cover up the true nature of payments. Throughout the course of the conspiracy, Shah and his co-conspirators engaged in a series of email and text messages in which they discussed the need to recruit TRIACRE beneficiaries and prescribe them expensive compounded medications. Throughout the course of the conspiracy, the evidence demonstrated that Shah wrote prescriptions that caused TRICARE make payments to Atlantic Pharmacy in the approximate amount of $1,033,090.00.“Dr. Shah chose to line his pockets rather than uphold the trust his patients placed in him,” said U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners will continue to work tirelessly to identify for prosecution individuals, including healthcare providers, who carry out kickback schemes against Tricare or other federal health care programs for their own personal financial benefit at a loss to the deserving beneficiaries.”“Shah ignored his Hippocratic Oath when he decided to pursue personal profit over patient care,” said Cyndy Bruce, Special Agent in Charge of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Southeast Field Office.  “DCIS and its law enforcement partners are fiercely committed to protecting America’s Warfighters and the integrity of TRICARE, the military health care program.”“The sentence obtained today has been the culmination of a thorough investigation completed by our agents revealing abuse by medical professionals of Federal benefits programs for personal gain,” said Special Agent in Charge Christopher Cave, of the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General Southern Area Field Office. “The USPS-OIG, along with our law enforcement partners will continue to vigorously investigate these types of cases in order to deter and stop these fraud schemes.”“Those who choose to attempt to defraud the U.S. healthcare system, undermine the entire system and those providers who obey the law,” said Frank Robey, director of the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command’s Major Procurement Fraud Unit. “We hope that today's sentencing will deter others from this type of illegal scheme.”“The FDA recognizes that compounded drugs can serve an important role for patients whose medical needs cannot be met by an FDA-approved drug product. But when doctors disregard the drug approval process for personal profit, they put their patients at risk,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge H. Peter Kuehl, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Miami Field Office. “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice physicians who endanger the health of unsuspecting American consumers in this manner.”“Dr. Shah not only violated the laws of the United States - he violated the trust placed in him by his patients,” said Thomas W. South, OPM’s Deputy Assistant Inspector General for Investigations.  “Every patient deserves health care providers that meet the highest standards of ethical and professional behavior.  Today’s sentencing reminds all providers that they must observe those standards, and reflects the commitment of the OPM-OIG to pursue improper and illegal conduct that puts the health and wellbeing of Federal employees, annuitants, and their families at risk.”U.S. Attorney Fajardo Orshan thanked DCIS, USPS-OIG, U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, FDA-OCI, and OPM-OIG for their investigative efforts in this case.The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Dan Bernstein and Jonathan Stratton.Related court documents and information may be found on the website of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida atwww.flsd.uscourts.govor onhttp://pacer.flsd.uscourts.gov.Topic(s):Financial FraudComponent(s):USAO - Florida, Southern"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of VermontFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, May 23, 2019Four individuals were charged with conspiring in a multi-year wire fraud scheme to defraud immigrant investors seeking green cards through the EB-5 program, among other charges, announced United States Attorney for the District of Vermont Christina E. Nolan.Ariel Quiros, 63, William Kelly, 70, both of Florida; Jong Weon Choi, aka Alex Choi, 58, of South Korea; and William Stenger, 70, of Newport, Vermont, were indicted by the federal grand jury on criminal charges in connection with their management of the Jay Peak Biomedical Research Park EB-5 investment project, also called the AnC Vermont project. In addition to the wire fraud conspiracy count, the defendants face other charges, including six separate counts of wire fraud and various counts of concealing material facts or presenting false statements in a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency, namely United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which oversaw the EB-5 process. Quiros is also charged with two counts of money laundering. The indictment alleges that the defendants misrepresented facts to the SEC, which investigated the Jay Peak EB-5 offerings while the defendants were seeking new AnC investors. A civil action by the SEC ended the defendants’ control of the EB-5 projects.U.S. Attorney Christina E. Nolan stated: “As alleged in this indictment, this scheme defrauded hopeful immigrant investors in what may be the largest financial crime in our state history. I commend our prosecutors and our partners in the FBI, IRS, and FDA-OIG for their dogged investigation of this complex fraud that shook our small state.  This indictment demonstrates that the U.S. Attorney’s Office is determined to address the most challenging cases, and that we have the talent, will, and resources in our office and law enforcement agencies to meet those challenges.”The charges against the defendants are only allegations. The defendants are presumed to be innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. The defendants face a maximum penalty on the most serious charges of 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release, a $250,000 fine or twice the gross gain or loss, and restitution to the victims. The indictment also alleges forfeiture against the defendants.“This case is about greed and deceit. The fraud alleged in this indictment and the related fraud alleged by the SEC and the State of Vermont have affected many Vermonters,” stated James N. Hendricks, Special Agent in Charge of the Albany Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. “The defendants’ broken business promises have left not only a physical scar on the city of Newport, but also an intangible scar on the promise of economic development for the Northeast Kingdom and on the dreams of many hopeful immigrants. By seeking to hold accountable those who break the law and cause such harm, we hope to help to heal these scars. The dedicated work and cooperation among the FBI, IRS, FDA and U.S. Attorney’s Office have resulted in the arrests today. The FBI will continue working with our law enforcement partners to stop those who abuse government programs for their own gain.”“As alleged in the indictment, the defendants obtained tens of millions from investors in connection with an EB-5 offering that was based on misleading statements and involved a misuse of the money raised,” said Kristina O’Connell, Special Agent in Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation, Boston Field Office.  “IRS-CI’s tracing of the investors’ funds helped investigators uncover the breadth of the alleged fraud and we are proud of our role in this collaborative law enforcement effort.”The indictment alleges a scheme conceived in 2011 and carried through until the defendants lost control of the project in April 2016. The AnC project was the seventh EB-5 project managed by Quiros and Stenger, but the first involving a business outside a ski resort. The defendants designed the project to raise $110 million from immigrant investors in order to build and operate a biotechnology company, AnC Vermont, on a property in Newport. From 2012 to 2016, the defendants obtained over $80 million from over 160 immigrant investors in the AnC project. Under the EB-5 program created by Congress, immigrant investors could obtain lawful permanent residency (green cards) by investing $500,000 each in a United States business that would create ten jobs per investment. Pursuant to federal law, the AnC project was regulated and monitored by USCIS and the Vermont Regional Center, a part of state government.According to the indictment, the defendants’ scheme involved both secret embezzlement of immigrant investor funds and deceit about the AnC project’s jobs and revenue. The defendants designed the project so that Quiros and Choi, who were secret partners, could siphon millions of dollars in investor funds into their pockets. As the defendants raised investor money, Quiros used the money for his own purposes instead of using it to build the project. The defendants then concealed this misuse of funds.The indictment also charges that the defendants created a fraudulent AnC business plan based on a “party line” conceived to misrepresent the number of jobs that would be created by the project and the business revenue that would be generated from the project. Marketing the project to immigrant investors depended on job creation and future revenue, since the defendants emphasized their ability to satisfy the job creation standards under EB-5 law and repay immigrant investors. The indictment charges that the defendants devised job and revenue projections based on the number of jobs needed to obtain project approval from USCIS without regard to a viable plan to actually create those jobs or achieve those revenues. AnC Vermont would supposedly rent clean rooms, market stem cell therapies, and manufacture artificial organs. The defendants made fraudulent statements in regard to all three facets of the future business, in particular with regard to how soon the project would generate jobs and revenue. Rather than disclose that they were creating a start-up business that would need large capital reserves to operate in the early stages, the defendants falsely represented that they had a plan where AnC Vermont would successfully market its products as soon as construction was complete.In addition to the wire fraud and wire fraud conspiracy charges, the indictment charges Quiros with two money laundering counts relating to two transactions where he used AnC investor funds for personal expenses, specifically a $6 million payment to the IRS and the purchase of a vehicle.Further, the indictment contains five concealment or false statement counts. First, it alleges that the defendants concealed from the Vermont Regional Center how Quiros used approximately $21 million in investor funds to pay off a loan unrelated to the AnC Vermont project. Next, the indictment alleges that Quiros, Kelly, and Choi concealed that Choi was being investigated  in Korea for financial crimes, and falsely represented that AnC Korea, a company they claimed would supply the technologies that AnC Vermont would market, was not in financial distress.Finally, the indictment charges Stenger with presenting false documents and statements to the Vermont Regional Center. One of these counts focuses on a misrepresentation by Stenger that he had followed the Regional Center’s direction to stop marketing the AnC project in mid-2014. The other charges as false a written presentation Stenger made to the Regional Center in January 2015 as he was seeking permission to continue recruiting investors for the AnC project.Quiros, Kelly, and Stenger surrendered to the custody of the United States Marshals Service this morning and are scheduled to appear for arraignment on the charges in federal court later today. Choi remains at large.The United States Attorney expresses her gratitude for the outstanding investigation leading up to these charges by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Criminal Investigation Divisions of the Internal Revenue Service, the Food and Drug Administration and for the assistance of the Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeWestern District of WisconsinFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEJune 27, 2019MADISON, WIS. -- A federal grand jury in the Western District of Wisconsin, sitting in Madison, returned the following indictments yesterday.  You are advised that a charge is merely an accusation and that a defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty.New York Woman Charged with Conspiracy & Causing the Introduction of Misbranded Drugs into Interstate CommerceUrsula Wing, 41, New York City, is charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States and causing the introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce.  The indictment alleges that Wing illegally smuggled into the United States misbranded prescription drugs from India, which were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for distribution in the United States, and that she sold these misbranded prescription drugs to customers in the United States and around the world.The indictment alleges that the prescription drugs sold by Wing were misbranded in that they were dispensed without a valid prescription from a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs, and that the labeling of the drugs lacked adequate directions for use by a lay person. The indictment alleges that Wing did not possess a valid wholesale drug distribution license, a valid pharmacy license, or a license to prescribe prescription drugs.The indictment further alleges that Wing attempted to disguise the nature of her sale of prescription drugs by 1) creating a fake company called “Fatima’s Bead Basket,” which she listed as the shipper on the envelope going to the customer; 2) by inserting a necklace or other item of jewelry in the shipping envelope to serve as the cover piece of merchandise being mailed to the customer; 3) by packaging the misbranded drugs in a smaller packet that was in a hidden panel and taped to the inside of the shipping envelope; 4) by disguising the nature of the item being purchased by listing on the invoice alternate jewelry product names, each of which had a code to indicate the actual item being ordered; 5) by mailing these misbranded drugs from the United States to customers around the world, and falsely characterizing the exports on U.S. Customs forms as jewelry; and 6) by creating a fake online jewelry business for use as a cover for selling the misbranded drugs, allowing her clients to pay for the misbranded drugs using their credit cards, with the sales showing up on the merchant account as jewelry.The indictment alleges that from June 2016 through June 2018, Wing conspired to defraud the United States by impeding lawful functions of federal law enforcement and regulatory agencies, and that from January 2018 through February 2018, Wing caused the introduction of unapproved, misbranded prescription drugs mifepristone and misoprostol into interstate commerce by sending the drugs from the state of New York to Wisconsin.If convicted, Wing faces a maximum penalty of five years in federal prison on the conspiracy charge, and three years on the felony charge of causing the introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce.  The charges against Wing are the result of an investigation by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and IRS Criminal Investigation.  The prosecution of this case is being handled by Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Graber.Component(s):USAO - Wisconsin, Western"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of FloridaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, September 19, 2019The Department of Justice announced today that compounding pharmacy Diabetic Care Rx LLC, or Patient Care America (PCA), PCA’s Chief Executive Officer Patrick Smith, PCA’s former Vice President of Operations Matthew Smith, and private equity firm Riordan, Lewis & Haden Inc. (RLH) have agreed to resolve a lawsuit alleging that they violated the False Claims Act through their involvement in a kickback scheme to generate referrals of prescriptions for expensive pain creams, scar creams, and vitamins, regardless of patient need, which were reimbursed by TRICARE, the federal health care program for military members and their families. PCA and RLH have agreed to pay $21,050,000, Patrick Smith has agreed to pay at least $300,000, and Matthew Smith has agreed to pay at least $12,788. These settlement amounts were based on defendants’ ability to pay.“Kickback schemes taint decision-making and cause taxpayer-funded health care programs to pay for items or services that patients may not need,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt for the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. “We will hold accountable health care providers involved in such schemes designed to induce referrals of prescriptions that are reimbursed by federal health care programs.”“The prosecution and resolution of this case demonstrates the U.S. Attorney’s Office continuing commitment to hold all responsible parties to account for the submission of claims to federal health care programs that are tainted by unlawful kickback arrangements,” said United States Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan. “Kickback schemes lead to unnecessary medical services and drive up the cost of health care for all.”“This settlement sends a clear message about the Defense Criminal Investigation Service (DCIS) and its law enforcement partners’ unwavering commitment to protect the integrity of TRICARE, the Department of Defense’s health care program which serves to protect our U.S. military, their family members, and military retirees,” said Special Agent in Charge Cyndy Bruce of the DCIS Southeast Field Office. “Health care providers who manipulate and abuse the TRICARE program in order to seek financial gain by submitting false claims and demonstrating a lack of regard for TRICARE patients and the health care plan which is charged to provide their medical care, will be diligently investigated and held accountable for their actions.”This settlement resolves a lawsuit pursued by the United States against PCA for allegedly paying kickbacks to outside “marketers” to target military members and their families for prescriptions for compounded creams and vitamins, which were formulated to ensure the highest possible reimbursement from TRICARE. The United States alleged that the marketers paid telemedicine doctors who prescribed the creams and vitamins without seeing the patients, or in some cases, even speaking to them. The settlement also resolves the United States’ allegations that PCA and a marketer routinely jointly paid the copayments owed by patients referred by the marketer, without any verification of the patients’ financial needs, and then disguised the payments as coming from a sham charitable organization, which was affiliated with the marketer. Finally, the settlement resolves the United States’ allegations that PCA continued to claim reimbursement for prescriptions referred by the marketers despite regularly receiving complaints from patients that revealed the prescriptions were being generated without patient consent or a valid patient-prescriber relationship. RLH, the private equity firm that managed PCA on behalf of its investors, allegedly knew of and agreed to the plan to pay outside marketers to generate the prescriptions and financed the kickback payments to the marketers. Patrick Smith and Matthew Smith were executives of PCA who allegedly executed the scheme.The lawsuit resolved by the settlement was originally filed under the whistleblower (or “qui tam”) provisions of the False Claims Act by Marisela Medrano and Ada Lopez, two former employees of PCA. The qui tam provisions permit private individuals to sue on behalf of the government for false claims and to share in any recovery. The False Claims Act authorizes the United States to intervene and take over such lawsuits, which the United States did here, in part. The share to be awarded in this case has not been determined yet.This civil settlement was the result of a coordinated effort by the Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch (Fraud Section), the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations.The lawsuit is captioned United States ex rel. Medrano and Lopez v. Diabetic Care Rx LLC, d/b/a Patient Care America, et al., No. 15-CV-62617 (S.D. Fla.). The claims resolved by the settlement are allegations only and there has been no determination of liability.Component(s):USAO - Florida, Southern"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of FloridaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, September 4, 2019Ariana Fajardo Orshan, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and Justin Green, Special Agent in Charge, Miami Field Office, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI), announced the convictions of five defendants for various offenses relating to a global fraud scheme that relied upon false claims about the United States military and the Government of Afghanistan.Six individuals were charged for their involvement in the global fraud scheme (Case No. 18-20668-CR-DMM).  Byramji Javat, a citizen of Pakistan and Chairman of the Dubai-based Uniworld Group, pleaded guilty on August 19, 2019, to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section1349.  Javat faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, plus potential restitution and a fine of up to $250,000.  Sunil Chopra and William Armando, both residents of California, each pleaded guilty on August 19, 2019, to one count of conspiracy to obtain pre-retail medical products worth $5,000 or more by fraud or deception, in violation of Title18, United States Code, Section 670(a)(6).  They face a maximum statutory penalty of 15 years in prison.  Emanuel Daskos, pleaded guilty on July 16, 2019, to also violating Title 18, United States Code, Section 670(a)(6).   Luis Soto, a customs broker residing in Miami, Florida, was convicted by a  trial jury on August 23, 2019, of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to obtain pre-retail medical products worth $5,000 or more by fraud or deception, two counts of wire fraud contrary to Title 18, United States Code, Section 1343, and two counts of obtaining pre-retail medical products by fraud or deception, contrary to Title 18, United States Code, Section 670(a)(1).   The defendants have not yet been sentenced.  One defendant, James Sipprell, a resident of Georgia, is awaiting trial and is presumed innocent.According to the superseding indictment, between 2014 and 2017, Javat orchestrated a fraud scheme to purchase FDA-regulated products including medical devices from manufacturers in the United States at deeply discounted prices by lying to them about the destination and purpose of the goods.  Javat represented that he was a large supplier of medical and food products to United States troops in Afghanistan, and sought deep discounts from the manufacturers by claiming that he could provide their goods to American troops in Afghanistan or to the Afghan people.  In truth, Javat wanted to obtain these products at prices not generally offered in the United States in order to sell those products himself in this country – not abroad, and not to the military – at a significant profit.To execute this scheme, the conspirators insisted that products be packaged for the United States market, falsely claiming to the manufacturers that this was required by the U.S. military, the Afghan government, or the “Buy American Act.”   When the products nonetheless had stickers or other packaging on them stating that the items were for export only, the conspirators secretly removed those labels.  After acquiring the products, Javat and the co-conspirators arranged for the diversion of the products to various locations in the United States.  To conceal this activity, the conspirators typically shipped the products abroad and then had them immediately shipped back to the United States, or provided the victims with fraudulent shipping documentation showing that the products were exported when actually they had never left this country.Javat admitted the allegations of the superseding indictment during his guilty plea.  During Soto’s trial, the government proved these allegations to the jury and presented additional evidence about the defendants’ scheme.  For example, the conspirators often represented that they were purchasing items on behalf of the Afghanistan Reconstruction and Development Services (“ARDS”), which at one time was an agency of the Afghan Government funded in part by the United States.  That agency ceased to exist after 2014, yet the conspirators provided victims with fake documents supposedly from ARDS imposing extravagant demands that in reality only suited the conspirators’ needs.  In 2016, Uniworld prepared an internal Powerpoint presentation expressly informing its staff that they had to be “good at lying.”  Finally, because these goods were moving outside normal channels, they often were mishandled; for example, according to the conspirators’ own emails at the time, the defendants disregarded temperature requirements when transshipping over-the-counter pain medicines, one of the defendants kept a shipment of diabetic test strips that required refrigeration in his car trunk overnight and another shipment of medical products became covered in bird droppings.  The products involved in Javat’s scheme included surgical instruments, professional dental care devices, bandages, and aspirin.The evidence at trial demonstrated that Soto knew about Javat’s fraud scheme yet knowingly helped him by supplying paperwork to federal agencies including the FDA to facilitate the re-entry of the diverted products into the United States through the Port of Miami or Miami International Airport.  Chopra, Armando and Daskos also knowingly furthered the scheme by helping to transport the products and remove export labels.U.S. Attorney Fajardo Orshan commended the investigative efforts of the FDA-OCI.  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys David Turken and John Shipley.Component(s):USAO - Florida, Southern"

He was a profiteer, callously making millions of dollars and living a life of leisure while exploiting those suffering through opioid addiction,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Vernon Stejskal said in his closing argument Thursday afternoon. The jury began deliberations Thursday afternoon.U.S. Attorney for Utah John W. Huber, Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, Special Agent in Charge Steven Cagen of Homeland Security Investigations in Denver, DEA District Agent in Charge Brian Besser, Special Agent in Charge Charles L. Grinstead of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations Kansas City Field Office, Special Agent in Charge Tara Sullivan of the IRS Criminal Investigation Las Vegas Field Office, and Acting Inspector in Charge Jessica Wagner of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service’s Phoenix Division, announced the jury verdict today.“The opioid crisis has devastated individuals, families, and entire communities across the nation.  Aaron Shamo controlled and led a highly profitable organization that delivered fentanyl-laced counterfeit pills to every state in the union.  Though his customers remained faceless on the dark web, their despair was real.  Shamo profited off that despair and a jury of his peers has held him accountable,” U.S. Attorney John W. Huber said today.“We may never know the full extent of the lives lost or the families harmed by Aaron Shamo’s deadly enterprise as a global drug dealer.  Shamo’s conviction today is a significant victory in the ongoing war on illegal opioids in our state and nation. Utahns owe a debt of gratitude to all involved in taking down this predator,” Utah Attorney General Sean D. Reyes said today.Shamo and his co-conspirators purchased pill presses to manufacture pills so they would appear to be legitimate pharmaceutical drugs. Shamo then distributed the controlled substances to other individuals for distribution in all 50 states using their storefront, PHARMA-MASTER, on the Dark Net marketplace AlphaBay and the U.S. mail. Federal law enforcement agents and prosecutors say an undercover purchase of 100 oxycodone is a substantial step in an investigation. Shamo sold half a million pills – or more.\"The rapid emergence of extremely potent and highly addictive synthetic opioids has drastically changed the landscape for both drug addiction and drug enforcement.  Fentanyl and its many analogues are lethal in just milligrams.  Any criminal exploitation of this powerful drug poses a significant public safety threat to our community, to those struggling with opioid addiction, and to the many first responders who diligently strive to keep us safe.  The DEA is committed to aggressively identify and investigate any person or organization trafficking in or clandestinely manufacturing synthetic opioids for profit.“The comprehensive investigation into the Aaron Shamo counterfeit pill manufacturing network shows how dangerous these enterprises are.  The subsequent conviction of Mr. Shamo proves that those who operate with blatant disregard for public safety will bear the full weight of the law and be held accountable for their crimes,\"  Brian S. Besser, DEA District Agent in Charge, said today.“A major narcotics and money laundering operation was dismantled due to the technological expertise of our agents and law enforcement partners,” said Steven Cagen, Special Agent in Charge of U.S. Homeland Security Investigations in Denver.  “Criminals who ruthlessly seek profits and personal gain at the expense of victims in our communities can’t hide in the dark web.  We remain steadfast in our resolve to bring to justice those that push dangerous drugs into our neighborhoods and contribute to the epidemic of opioid addiction in our country.”“The illegal manufacture and distribution of opioids can result in overdoses and deaths, further fueling the national crisis,” said Special Agent in Charge Charles L. Grinstead, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Kansas City Field Office. “The FDA is committed to doing our part to disrupt and dismantle illegal prescription drug manufacturing and distribution networks, including those that import raw materials from overseas to create counterfeit drugs, and misuse the internet to distribute those drugs with reckless disregard of the risk to public health and safety.”“Trafficking opioids through the dark web enabled Mr. Shamo and his organization to profit and launder millions through this illicit activity,” said Special Agent in Charge Tara Sullivan, IRS Criminal Investigation.  “Today’s verdict is just, and shows IRS Criminal Investigation’s continued effort in prosecuting those who bring harm to our community.”“Postal Inspectors are committed to keeping the U.S. Mail safe for all.  As criminals change their methods, we continue to adapt, capture, and hold the perpetrators accountable.  Along with our excellent law enforcement partners, we will continue to show criminals the dark web is never truly anonymous,” stated Acting Inspector in Charge Jessica Wagner of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Phoenix Division.Evidence presented at trial showed that Shamo established himself as the CEO of a nationwide drug distribution network.  In closing arguments, prosecutors said Shamo became the person he set out to be – the Pharma Master.  Evidence at trial showed Shamo did the things leader and organizers do, prosecutors said. He was in control of the majority of the functions of the enterprise.  He established the dark web storefront, hired employees, took charge of marketing and product placement. He was a drug dealer to other drug dealers. He had the contacts in China and ordered the fentanyl.  Most significantly, investigators were led to Shamo as they followed the proceeds of the drug trafficking organization. He had sole access to incoming bitcoin payments from customers. Shamo referred to the organization as his baby and his empire, prosecutors said in closing arguments today.Evidence showed Shamo developed the fentanyl product through a dangerous “trial and error” process as he distributed it to individuals across the country.  Experts say 1 milligram of fentanyl in a pill can have dangerous consequences up to and including death.Evidence showed Shamo received messages from customers that they were getting sick.  His response, prosecutors said, was to send more pills to the complaining customers.  There was no shortage of fake pain pills.  Co-defendants in the case, who were responsible for packaging and shipping, used a vacuum to clean up pills from the floor because they believed it was not worth their time to pick them up because of the volume of pills they were manufacturing.The jury convicted Shamo, 29, of Cottonwood Heights, Utah, of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, three counts of aiding and abetting the importation of a controlled substance, possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, manufacture of a controlled substance, and two counts of knowing and intentional adulteration of drugs while held for sale. The jury also found Shamo guilty of aiding and abetting the use of the U.S. Mail in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense, conspiracy to commit money laundering, money laundering promotion and concealment, and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity.Sentencing in the case will be Dec. 3, 2019, at 2:30 p.m. in U.S. District Judge Dale A. Kimball’s courtroom. Shamo faces a potential mandatory-minimum life sentence. He remains in the custody of U.S. Marshals.Sentencings are pending for co-conspirators in the case, who reached plea agreements with federal prosecutors.Assistant U.S. Attorney Vernon Stejskal of the U.S. Attorney’s Office and Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michael Gadd and Kent A. Burggraaf prosecuted the case.  Gadd and Burggraaf are Assistant Attorneys General in the Utah Attorney General’s Office.  Special agents of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Investigations, DEA, IRS-Criminal Investigation, the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, and Postal Inspectors with the U.S. Postal Inspection Service investigated the case.Topic(s):Drug TraffickingOpioidsComponent(s):USAO - Utah"

Kennedy, Jr. announced today that Samuel McFarland, 55, of Rochester, NY, who was convicted of two counts of smuggling goods into the United States, was sentenced to serve 24 months’ probation by U.S. District Judge David G. Larimer.Assistant U.S. Attorney Sean C. Eldridge, who handled the case, stated that on April 10, 2017, Customs and Border Protection officers at the John F. Kennedy International Airport intercepted a package coming from Hong Kong that was addressed to the defendant. The package contained 3,012 counterfeit Viagra pills and 190 counterfeit Cialis pills.On January 8, 2018, CBP officers at the Rochester International Airport intercepted a package coming from China that was also addressed to McFarland’s residence. That package contained 100 bottles which included 30 counterfeit Cialis pills in each. The manifest for the package of 3000 counterfeit pills falsely listed the contents as “free trade sample” and claimed the package contained 50 plastic bottles valued at $1.00 each. Thereafter, on January 25, 2018, Homeland Security Investigations conducted a controlled delivery at the defendant’s residence of the package intercepted on January 8, 2018. McFarland answered the door and signed for the package. Federal agents then approached the house and executed a federal search warrant.The defendant admitted to agents that he ordered both the April 2017 package and the January 2018 package, knowing that they contained counterfeit pills. An analysis of McFarland’s cellular phone revealed several searches for “fake Viagra,” related searches for pictures of real and counterfeit Viagra pills, searches for terms such as “package us customs detainment,” and photos that were cached from websites including “how to get Viagra for $1.”The sentencing is the result of an investigation by Homeland Security Investigations, under the direction of Special Agent-in-Charge Kevin Kelly; Customs and Border Protection, under the direction of Director of Field Operations Rose Brophy; and the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, under the direction of Special Agent-in-Charge Jeffrey Ebersole, New York Field Office.# # # #Component(s):USAO - New York, Western"

Boyle, Special Agent-in-Charge, Drug Enforcement Administration, New England Field Office (DEA), announced the charges.Since approximately January 2018, law enforcement agents with FDA-OCI, USPIS, HSI, CBP, DEA, FBI and other agencies have been investigating the large-scale importation of misbranded controlled substances, including Tramadol, into the United States from India.  As part of the defendants’ scheme, distributors in India shipped misbranded Tramadol and other drugs to individuals and entities in the United States through the U.S. mail and other commercial couriers. The defendants primarily operated out of a warehouse in Queens where they repackaged the pills and mailed them to customers throughout the United States. The defendants maintained daily ledgers detailing the names, addresses, pill size and pill amounts ordered by customers. During the course of the investigation, the defendants distributed millions of Tramadol pills.Ezhil Sezhian Kamaldoss is also charged with money laundering.“As alleged, the defendants participated in a black market for prescription medications by distributing millions of opioid pills in tens of thousands of transactions in one year alone,” stated United States Attorney Donoghue. “This Office and our law enforcement partners will continue to vigorously investigate and prosecute those who profit from the suffering wrought by opioid distribution in the United States.” Mr. Donoghue expressed his appreciation to the United States Attorneys’ Offices for the District of Maryland, the District of Massachusetts and the Southern District of Ohio for their assistance in the case.“The illegal manufacture and distribution of opioids can result in overdoses and deaths, further fueling the national crisis,” stated FDA Special Agent-in-Charge McCormack. “The FDA is committed to disrupting and dismantling illegal prescription drug distribution networks, including those that import unapproved drugs from overseas, and distribute those drugs with reckless disregard of the risk to public health.”“The importation of mislabeled drugs is both dangerous and illegal,” stated FBI Special Agent-in-Charge Wickerham. “It contributes to the ongoing opioid crisis in our nation and causes harm to our communities.”“Postal Inspectors are always at the forefront in protecting communities from the scourge of illegal drugs, no matter how they enter this country, and today’s arrests are a shining example of our commitment to keep the public safe,” stated USPIS Inspector-in-Charge Bartlett.“These individuals chose greed and profit at the cost of human lives.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of New YorkFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, September 13, 2019Manufacturer Admits to Selling Uncleared Devices, Agrees to Pay $9.5 MillionGeoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Mark S. McCormack, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office (“FDA”), announced today that the United States has simultaneously filed and settled a civil fraud lawsuit under the False Claims Act against AVALIGN TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (“Avalign”), and its subsidiary INSTRUMED INTERNATIONAL, INC. (“Instrumed,” and together with Avalign, “Defendants”), for manufacturing and selling medical devices that were not cleared by the FDA. These uncleared devices were used by medical providers in spinal surgeries, circumcisions, and other medical procedures. The providers submitted claims for reimbursement to Medicare and Medicaid for those procedures. As part of the settlement, approved in Manhattan federal court by U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos, Defendants agreed to pay the Government $9,500,000 and admitted to conduct alleged in the United States’ complaint.Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said: “It is critical that the devices used in some of the most consequential medical procedures have the required FDA approval or clearance. Unapproved or uncleared devices used in medical procedures present a significant public health and safety risk, and this Office will continue to hold manufacturers of medical devices accountable for profiting from sales of uncleared devices.”Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack said: “U.S. patients rely on FDA oversight to ensure that medical devices are safe and effective. When companies fail to follow FDA rules, they put patients’ health at risk. We will continue to investigate and bring to justice companies that attempt to evade FDA requirements and jeopardize the public health.”As alleged in the complaint filed with the settlement agreement, since 1976, many different kinds of medical devices must, depending on the degree of patient risk, be approved or cleared by the FDA before they can be marketed for use on patients. There is a grandfather exception for medical devices that were legally in commerce prior to 1976, which are known as “pre-amendment” devices. To qualify for pre-amendment status, the device’s owner (typically the manufacturer) must, among other things, have marketed the device prior to May 28, 1976. From 2007 through 2014, Instrumed sold medical devices for which Instrumed had not obtained the required clearances from the FDA and for which Instrumed could not demonstrate that the pre-amendment exception applied.As part of the settlement, Defendants admitted, among other things, that:In February 2009, Instrumed’s then-head of Quality and Regulatory Affairs acknowledged in an email in response to an inquiry about an Instrumed device, that “we cannot claim pre-amendment because Instrumed was not selling/marketing this device before May 28, 1976.”By no later than April 2009, representatives of Instrumed and CareFusion Corporation (“CareFusion”), a customer of Instrumed pre-amendment devices and distributor of those devices, began exchanging correspondence regarding whether Instrumed and CareFusion could legitimately rely on Instrumed’s invocation of the pre-amendment status exemption to market its devices.CareFusion repeatedly informed Instrumed that the evidence Instrumed was relying on to justify its claim that certain devices qualified for the pre-amendment status exemption – evidence consisting of excerpts from a catalogue issued by the devices’ original manufacturer, not Instrumed, and an affidavit from an Instrumed employee – was insufficient.  Instrumed never provided CareFusion a satisfactory affidavit to justify its claim that the devices qualified for the pre-amendment status exemption.In March 2014, the FDA issued a warning letter indicating that it had determined that Instrumed’s devices “are not pre-amendment devices that were legally on the market in the United States prior to May 28, 1976.”Instrumed ultimately decided t discontinue sale of these products and conducted a recall of these products.  Throughout the period 2007 to 2014, however, Instrumed continued to sell the devices listed in the settlement agreement.  Some of the devices were then sold by Instrumed’s customers to hospitals and other medical providers, and used in procedures for which providers submitted claims for reimbursement to federal health care programs.Of the $9.5 million that Defendants agreed to pay under the settlement, $8,128,440.60 will go to the United States and $1,371,559.40 will go to states impacted by Defendants’ conduct through separate settlements with those states.In connection with this settlement, the United States joined a private whistleblower lawsuit that had previously been filed under seal pursuant to the False Claims Act. The United States had previously reached a settlement with CareFusion, which was entered by the Court on May 7, 2019. As part of that settlement, CareFusion agreed to pay a total of $3.3 million to the United States and certain states, and admitted to selling devices that Instrumed wrongly claimed qualified for the pre-amendment exception.Mr. Berman thanked the FDA, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for their invaluable assistance in this matter.The case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Frauds Unit.  Assistant United States Attorneys Sharanya Mohan and Mónica P. Folch are in charge of the case.Attachment(s):Download avalign_14cv4958_stip_and_order_settlement_and_partial_dismissal.pdfComponent(s):USAO - New York, SouthernPress Release Number:19-293"

The total combined loss of other federal agencies is $718,474.31SAN JUAN, P.R. – On July 24 and 26, 2019, a Federal Grand Jury in the District of Puerto Rico returned six separate indictments charging eight (8) individuals with fraud against the Social Security Administration (SSA) in Puerto Rico, announced U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodríguez Vélez for the District of Puerto Rico. These cases were investigated by the Social Security Office of Inspector General (SSA-OIG) with the collaboration of the Department of Homeland Security, Office of Inspector General (DHS-OIG); Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG); the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA); Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of the Inspector General (VA-OIG); Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA); and the Police of Puerto Rico.The SSA is responsible for the implementation of the Disability Insurance Benefits Program. The SSA provides monetary benefits to workers with severe, long-term disabilities, who have worked in SSA-covered employment for a required length of time. Spouses and dependent children of disabled workers may also be eligible to receive benefits. Pursuant to SSA regulations, a claimant must prove to SSA that he or she is disabled by furnishing medical and other evidence with the application. The application and supporting evidence is evaluated by SSA to determine the individual’s medical impairments and the effect of the impairment on the claimant’s ability to work on a sustained basis.Three indictments charged four individuals with theft of government property, health care fraud, concealment, or failure to disclose work activity to SSA, and false statements or representations to the SSA. These defendants knowingly and willfully embezzled, stole, and converted to their own use the Social Security Disability Insurance Benefit payments to which the defendants knew that they were not entitled.The defendants charged with accepting by fraud the Social Security Disability Insurance Benefit payments, knowing that they were not entitled to the same, are: Brunilda Rodríguez-Reyes and her son, Gerardo O. Navedo-Rodríguez, who received $156,616,50 from SSA, and fraudulently caused Medicare to pay approximately $55,151.51; Lalin Mercado-Vargas who received $168,854.90 from SSA and fraudulently caused Medicare to pay him approximately $77,780.78; and Ramón Julbe-Rosa (Julbe-Rosa), who received $79,369.00 from SSA and fraudulently caused Medicare to pay him $47,002.10.Defendant Julbe-Rosa is also facing one count of fraud against the Department of Veterans Affairs for fraudulently receiving unemployability benefits, and one count of Fraud in Connection with Major Disaster or Emergency Benefits related to Hurricane María. Julbe-Rosa applied for an SBA Disaster Loan by falsely representing that on September 20, 2017, his primary residence, damaged by Hurricane Maria was located in Morovis, Puerto Rico when he well knew that this was not his primary residence. As a result, the defendant fraudulently received $50,000.00 from SBA. Julbe-Rosa was also charged with his wife Ena I. Octaviani with Introduction into Interstate Commerce of Unapproved New Drugs. Defendant Julbe-Rosa established and operated the websitewww.acietedeguanabana.comthrough which he promoted and sold various products intended as treatments for serious medical conditions without FDA approval. Defendant Julbe-Rosa sold at least $341,242.26 worth of unapproved new drugs. Defendant Ena I. Octaviani-Santana was charged in this same indictment with aiding and abetting Julbe-Rosa to submit false information to SSA.Defendant Carlos Del Valle-Figueroa was charged with distribution of controlled substances, theft of government property, concealment, or failure to disclose work activity to SSA, and false statements or representations to the SSA. Del Valle-Figueroa fraudulently received $33,222.00 from SSA.Defendant Johana Torres-Figueroa was charged with making false statements to SSA, aggravated identity theft, and fraud in connection with major disaster or emergency benefits. Between October 11, 2017, and continuing through January 2, 2018, Torres-Figueroa falsely and fraudulently applied for FEMA benefits on behalf of an elderly victim (M.G.O.), although the defendant knew that she was not the caregiver with authorization to request assistance on behalf of the elderly victim. As a result of this fraudulent scheme, Johana Torres-Figueroa received $500.00 for Critical Needs Assistance; $869.65 for Home Repair Assistance; $3,807.66 for Personal Property Assistance; and $748.00 for Rental Assistance, for a total of $5,925.31.In another indictment, David Arocho-Castro (son of C.C.R) was charged with theft of government property. After C.C.R died on December 21, 2011, David Arocho-Castro failed to notify SSA about her death and used the money that his mother received from the SSA, benefits to which he knew he was not entitled. As a result of this scheme, between January 3, 2012, and continuing through December 3, 2018, David Arocho-Castro stole from SSA approximately $31,392.00.“The U.S. Attorney’s Office and Federal Law Enforcement partners remain vigilant in our quest to identify those corrupt individuals who by deceit and fraud attempt to illegally benefit from federal funds depriving other law abiding citizens from much needed health benefits, disability and emergency assistance. We remain steadfast in our commitment to bring to justice unscrupulous individuals who illegally seek personal financial gain,” said United States Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez.”“Today’s arrests are the latest in our continued and ongoing effort to bring to justice all individuals who commit Social Security Fraud, said SSA-OIG, Special Agent in Charge John F. Grasso. “I am very grateful for the efforts of our law enforcement partners involved in these investigations, and for the continued commitment from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to aggressively pursue these important cases. I strongly encourage the public to report suspected instances of Social Security fraud to our dedicated Fraud Hotline at 1-855-278-5982 orhttps://oig.ssa.gov/report.”“The FBI appreciates the outstanding work of the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the Office of Inspector General for the Social Security Administration, Health & Human Services, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, and remains confident the we and our partners have the capacity to address any fraud scheme that threatens those who are in real need of these benefits, especially the elderly and the children,” said Judith Priegues-Lopez, Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the FBI-San Juan Field Office. “As always, we encourage anyone who has information on this fraud and any other fraud schemes to come forward. We are available 24 hours a day at 787-754-6000 andwww.tips.fbi.gov”.“The FDA’s drug approval process ensures that patients receive safe and effective products. Evading the FDA’s authority and selling unapproved drugs to vulnerable consumers will not be tolerated,” said Justin C. Fielder, Acting Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Miami Field Office. “The FDA remains fully committed to aggressively pursuing those who place profits above the health and safety of American consumers.”Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Vanessa D. Bonano-Rodríguez is in charge of the prosecution of these cases. If convicted, the defendants charged with SSA fraud could face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison; the defendant charged with Fraud in Connection with Major Disaster (Hurricane María) or Emergency Benefits faces a maximum penalty of up to 30 years in prison; and the defendant charged with health care fraud faces a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison. All defendants are subject to a fine of up to $250,000.00. The indictments contain only charges and are not evidence of guilt. The defendants are presumed to be innocent unless and until proven guilty.The U.S. Department of Justice established the National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF) to investigate, prosecute, and deter fraud in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, when billions of dollars in federal disaster relief poured into the Gulf Coast region. Its mission has expanded to include suspected fraud from any natural or manmade disaster. More than 20 federal, state, and local agencies participate in the NCDF, which allows the center to act as a centralized clearinghouse of information related to disaster relief fraud.Members of the public are reminded to apply a critical eye and do their due diligence before trusting anyone purporting to be working on behalf of disaster victims, and to be especially cautious of anyone who contacts you seeking personal identifying information or financial information. Members of the public who suspect fraud involving disaster relief efforts, or who believe that they have been the victim of fraud from a person or organization soliciting relief funds on behalf of disaster victims, should contact the National Disaster Fraud Hotline toll free at (866) 720-5721. The telephone line is staffed by a live operator 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You can also fax information to the Center at (225) 334-4707, or email it todisaster@leo.gov.

S. Food and Drug Administration, has pleaded guilty to an undisclosed conflict of interest involving more than $126,000 worth of jobs performed at Atlanta’s FDA facility by a company in which Gordon had a direct financial interest.“Federal employees are in a position of public trust and, as they perform their duties, must be held to the highest standards of integrity,” said U.S. Attorney Byung J. “BJay” Pak.  “Instead of exposing his conflict of interest, Mr. Gordon capitalized on it, putting his personal benefit above his obligation to serve the public.”“All federal employees are subject to specific ethics requirements that inform standards for their professional conduct and address matters such as conflicting financial interests, impartiality in performing official duties, and misuse of their position, among other things,” said Special Agent in Charge Antoinette V. Richard, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Office of Internal Affairs. “If we learn of an FDA employee engaging in improper behavior such as abusing their position for personal financial gain, we will act swiftly to investigate, and when appropriate, refer criminal violations to the Department of Justice for prosecution to ensure that those responsible are held accountable.”According to U.S. Attorney Pak, the charges and other information presented in court: Gordon was hired by the FDA in 1997.  From November, 2010 through December, 2017, Gordon was responsible for scheduling and overseeing building maintenance and the purchase of janitorial supplies for the FDA’s district office in Atlanta.  During the same time period, Gordon had a financial interest in P&E Management LLC (P&E), a Georgia corporation, which was principally owned and operated by Gordon’s co-defendant, Ivan Ponder.With Gordon’s oversight and project support, P&E was continually selected as a vendor to supply maintenance and janitorial services at Atlanta’s FDA facility.  In addition, Gordon often paid P&E for its work by using an FDA credit card issued to him.  Gordon neither disclosed to FDA management that he had a personal connection to P&E, nor did he report to the FDA that he was receiving financial payments from P&E.On August 6, 2019, Elvis Gordon, 53, of Marietta, Georgia, pleaded guilty to a federal conflict of interest charge.  On July 15, 2019, Ivan Ponder, 49, of Hiram, Georgia, pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting Gordon’s conflict of interest scheme.Sentencing for Gordon is scheduled for November 17, 2019 before United States District Judge Mark H. Cohen.This case is being investigated by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations Office of Internal Affairs.Assistant U.S. Attorneys Brent Alan Gray and Matthew S.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of AlabamaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEMonday, August 5, 2019United States Attorney Richard W. Moore of the Southern District of Alabama announces today that United States District Judge Jeffrey U. Beaverstock sentenced defendant Bryan Heath Wester, 43, a resident of Springville, Alabama, to imprisonment for 12 months and one day for tampering with a consumer product. As part of the sentence, the judge ordered that Wester undergo three years of supervised release after finishing his term of imprisonment, pay a $100 mandatory special assessment, receive substance abuse and mental health treatment as directed by the U.S. Probation Office, and pay restitution totaling $511.48 to a patient-victim in the case.On January 31, 2019, a federal grand jury for the Southern District of Alabama charged Wester with one count of tampering with consumer products in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1365(a). On April 26, 2019, Wester pleaded guilty to the charge. He faced up to ten years imprisonment.Wester admitted to the following facts at his plea hearing. He was previously a licensed nurse and a paramedic who worked for an air ambulance service in Demopolis, Alabama. On August 26, 2018, Wester, with reckless disregard for the risk that another person would be placed in danger of death and bodily injury, and under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to such risk, tampered with ketamine hydrochloride (ketamine), a consumer product that was manufactured outside of Alabama and affected interstate commerce. Wester accessed the controlled substances box inside a locked safe located on board an emergency helicopter, removed ketamine from two vials, and replaced the removed ketamine with saline, knowing that the ketamine was intended to be administered via injection to critically ill and injured patients being transported by helicopter for emergency treatment.On August 27, 2018, a critically injured patient required air transport to Mobile, Alabama. The patient had been run over by a cow and suffered head trauma and loss of consciousness. The on-board nurse attempted to administer ketamine. The vial appeared to have a blue glue on the cap. When the needle was inserted, the vial did not appear to be vacuum sealed. The nurse administered the dose but it did not have the anticipated effect. The nurse then obtained a second vial of ketamine and found that the cap had been glued on.On August 30, 2018, a special agent with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s Office of Criminal Investigations interviewed Wester, who admitted to removing ketamine from two vials on August 26. According to his statements, around midday on August 26 Wester asked another nurse on duty for the nurse’s set of keys to the locked narcotics on the helicopter, telling the other nurse that he would do the equipment check. The nurse gave Wester the keys. Wester opened the safe and did not lock one side back. The two-key lock system allowed Wester to return later with his own keys and access the safe. Later that evening, Wester went out to the helicopter, withdrew the ketamine from two vials, and replaced it with saline. Wester re-glued the tops of the vials with dermabond. There was a zip-tie securing the plastic narcotics box inside the safe; Wester cut the zip-tie off and replaced it with a new one. Wester also changed the number in the logbook to reflect the new number. The old number ended in a “2.” Wester changed it to a “1.”At today’s sentencing, District Judge Beaverstock underscored that Wester had abused his position of trust treating vulnerable patients and that Wester was no longer working as a paramedic and flight nurse as a result of the offense conduct.After sentencing, U.S. Attorney Moore stated, “Health care practitioners take an oath to treat the injured and vulnerable among us. This defendant brazenly violated that oath and has been held accountable for his criminal conduct. I commend the FDA for investigating this important case.”“FDA is fully committed to the vigorous criminal prosecution of any individual who threatens the safety and security of the U.S. drug supply,” said Justin Fielder, Acting Special Agent in Charge, FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations’ Miami Field Office. “The sentencing in this case should send a clear signal that this kind of illicit tampering activity will not be tolerated.”FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations investigated the case. Assistant United States Attorney Sinan Kalayoglu prosecuted the case.A copy of this press release may be found on the website of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Alabama athttp://www.justice.gov/usao/als/###"

Box in Oldham County, Kentucky.  The medication he shipped was misbranded, in that it was dispensed without a prescription and its labeling did not contain required directions for use.  He shipped this medication with the intent to defraud and mislead, by avoiding the FDA requirements for prescription drugs.To accomplish his introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce, Dholaria used a stamps.com shipping account registered in the name of “Sam H,” a false name he used for the purpose of conducting his unlawful business by means of the Postal Service.During the course of the investigation, federal agents seized over thirty (30) packages of prescription pills sent to Dholaria from India.  Those packages contained approximately:  52,000 tramadol pills (a Schedule IV opioid), 2,300 diazepam pills (a Schedule IV anti-anxiety medication, also known as Valium), 2,200 zolpidem tartrate pills, 1,200 clonazepam pills (a Schedule IV anti-anxiety medication, also known as Klonopin), and 1,500 carisoprodol pills (a Schedule IV muscle relaxant, also known as Soma).  Agents also seized nearly thirty (30) packages containing nearly 5,000 prescription pills of various types that agents witnessed Dholaria placing in the mail for delivery to United States residents.  Based on shipping records it appears that Dholaria shipped tens of thousands of prescription pills throughout the United States before he was caught.The charges Dholaria pleaded guilty to carry a maximum term of imprisonment of 11 years, a combined maximum fine of $750,000, and a one year term of supervised release.The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Madison Sewell and David Weiser, and is being investigated by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and Homeland Security Investigations.Component(s):USAO - Kentucky, Western"

Brady announced today.The eight-count Indictment, returned on June 26, named Jeetendra Harish Belani, aka Jeetu, age 36, of Mumbai, India, as the sole defendant. He is charged with conspiracy to import Schedule II and Schedule IV controlled substances, conspiracy to smuggle drugs into the United States, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and various substantive counts of drug importation, smuggling, and money laundering.According to the Indictment, Belani operated a drug-distribution entity based in India called LeeHPL Ventures. Between 2015 and 2019, Belani and his co-conspirators, through LeeHPL Ventures, allegedly imported and smuggled into the United States various drugs available only by prescription in the United States, including Tapentadol, a Schedule II controlled substance, as well as Tramadol, Carisoprodol, and Modafinil, all Schedule IV controlled substances. The Indictment also alleges that between 2015 and mid-2017, Belani conspired with William Kulakevich and Julia Fees to unlawfully smuggle a drug known as Etizolam into the United States for re-sale by Kulakevich and Fees via a website they operated—www.etizy.com. Etizolam is part of a class of drugs similar to benzodiazepines, which are often used to treat insomnia and anxiety and carry a potential for abuse and overdose. To evade detection by United States Customs and Border Protection officials, Belani and his co-conspirators also allegedly used false customs declarations that mischaracterized and undervalued the contents of packages sent to the United States by LeeHPL Ventures. In addition, according to the Indictment, Belani caused drug shipments to be broken into smaller quantities and shipped to multiple addresses to help ensure delivery and avoid interception by United States customs authorities. Belani also caused co-conspirators to initiate payments totaling tens of thousands of dollars from accounts in the United States to accounts controlled by Belani in India or other locations outside the United States, all as a means to promote Belani’s continued efforts to smuggle drugs into the United States.The most serious offenses with which Belani is charged, involving importation of a Schedule II controlled substance, carry a maximum sentence of not more than twenty years in prison, a fine of not more than $1,000,000, or both. Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the actual sentence imposed would be based upon the seriousness of the offenses and the prior criminal history, if any, of the defendant.Assistant United States Attorney Eric G. Olshan is prosecuting this case on behalf of the government.The United States Food and Drug Administration – Office of Criminal Investigations and Homeland Security Investigations conducted the investigation leading to the Indictment in this case.An indictment is an accusation.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeEastern District of North CarolinaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, August 9, 2019RALEIGH– United States Attorney Robert J. Higdon, Jr. announced that a federal grand jury has returned a 41-count Indictment, chargingABHISHEK KRISHNAN, owner of American Pure Whey, LLC, of mail fraud, introducing adulterated and misbranded foods into interstate commerce, and money laundering. The Indictment seeks forfeiture of approximately six million dollars and several Raleigh, North Carolina real properties.According to the Indictment, American Pure Whey sold protein powders in bulk to other dietary supplement manufacturers and in retail quantities to the public. Other dietary supplement suppliers purchased American Pure Whey products, but packaged them with their own labels, similarly reflecting high protein and low carbohydrate content. The American Pure Whey products were manufactured and packaged in New Bern, North Carolina.KRISHNANpromoted the products on the website,www.americanpurewhey.com, which claimed the company followed strict quality control standards to produce the highest quality protein powder. In a single 33 gram serving, the website represented that the protein powder products contained as high as 29 grams of protein and as low as 1.58 grams of carbohydrates. The labels affixed to the products manufactured by American Pure Whey also represented the high protein and low carbohydrate amounts.The Indictment alleges, however, that contrary to the representations on American Pure Whey’s website and on the product labels, the protein powder products manufactured and sold by American Pure Whey contained markedly lower protein and significantly higher carbohydrate contents in order to fraudulently increase the companies’ profit margin. The Indictment further alleges that between August 2015 and December 2018, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) agents acting in an undercover capacity and posing as consumers made six purchases on American Pure Whey’s website of various types of protein powder products. FDA analysis for protein and carbohydrate contents revealed significantly less protein and substantially more carbohydrates per serving than represented on the respective labels. For example, the 100% Whey Protein Isolate, cake batter flavor, purchased in December 2018, contained only ten grams of protein when the label declared 29 grams per serving. Further, there was 27 grams of carbohydrates when the label represented just 1.58 grams per serving.The Indictment also alleged that contrary toKRISHNAN’Sstatements about American Pure Whey’s strict quality control standards, APW lacked basic quality control procedures in the manufacturing, packaging and labeling of APW products. The Indictment further describesKRISHNANand American Pure Whey’s past interactions with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which conducted three regulatory inspections of American Pure Whey’s facilities between September 2015 and July 2019. At the close of each inspection, the FDA observed and noted numerous deficiencies in American Pure Whey’s manufacturing processes and procedures, including repeated issues with APW’s master manufacturing and batch production records. In addition, the FDA sent a Warning Letter toKRISHNANin May 2016, informing him that all of American Pure Whey’s protein powder products were adulterated because they were manufactured under conditions that did not conform to current good manufacturing practice, and at least one product was misbranded because FDA analysis revealed that the product contained less than half the amount of protein declared on the label.KRISHNANrepeatedly responded to the FDA stating that he would take corrective actions to address the deficiencies.Mr. Higdon commented: “This case is about honesty and integrity when offering a product to the public.  And those principles are critical when a manufacturer offers food and dietary products. The FDA and the Justice Department are committed to ensuring that the public knows what it is getting when it purchases products of this sort.  And we are committed to prosecuting those who willfully ignore the law.”“American consumers rely on the FDA to ensure that their foods, including dietary supplements, are safe, wholesome, and properly labeled. When criminals manufacture and sell adulterated and misbranded dietary supplements, they not only cheat consumers, but also place the U.S. public health at risk,” said Justin C. Fielder, Acting Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Miami Field Office. “FDA remains fully committed to pursuing and bringing to justice those who ignore the law.”Investigation of this case was conducted by the FDA, Office of Criminal Investigation, and the United States Department of Homeland Security. The prosecution is being handled by Assistant United States Attorney Susan B. Menzer and Special Assistant United States Attorney and FDA Associate General Counsel Shannon M. Singleton.The charges and allegations contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.Component(s):USAO - North Carolina, Eastern"

In December 2014, RB Group spun off Indivior Inc., and the two companies are no longer affiliated. On April 9, a federal grand jury sitting in Abingdon, Virginia, indicted Indivior for allegedly engaging in an illicit nationwide scheme to increase prescriptions of Suboxone. The United States’ criminal trial against Indivior is scheduled to begin on May 11, 2020, in the United States District Court in Abingdon, Virginia. Indivior is presumed innocent until proven guilty.To resolve its potential criminal liability stemming from the conduct alleged in the indictment of Indivior, RB Group has executed a non-prosecution agreement that requires the company to forfeit $647 million of proceeds it received from Indivior and not to manufacture, market, or sell Schedule I, II, or III controlled substances in the United States for three years. In addition, RB Group has agreed to cooperate fully with all investigations and prosecutions by the Department of Justice related, in any way, to Suboxone.“Today’s announcement demonstrates that this office will work tirelessly to address all facets of the opioid epidemic,” First Assistant United States Attorney Daniel P. Bubar of the Western District of Virginia said. “This historic resolution is the product of a continued partnership with the Virginia Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, FDA, HHS, and the U.S. Postal Service.”“This is a landmark moment in our fight to hold drug companies responsible for their role in the opioid crisis,” said Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring. “We will not allow anyone to put profits over people, or to exacerbate or exploit the opioid crisis for their own benefit. The Virginia Medicaid Fraud Control Unit’s expertise, capacity, and diligent investigation, combined with strong relationships with local, state, and federal partners, helped make this resolution possible.”“Opioid addiction and abuse is an immense public health crisis and taking steps to address it is one the FDA’s highest priorities,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “Providing misleading information about product benefits puts the public at risk. We also are particularly concerned with schemes to game the drug approval process to prevent generic competition for important medicines. The FDA, including criminal investigators in our Office of Regulatory Affairs and the lawyers in our Office of Chief Counsel, will continue to work with the Department of Justice to investigate and hold accountable those who devise and participate in schemes to the detriment of the public health.”“The U.S. Postal Service spends billions of dollars per year in workers compensation-related costs, most of which are legitimate,” said Kenneth Cleevely, Special Agent in Charge of the Eastern Field Office for the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General. “However, when medical providers or companies choose to flout the rules and profit illegally, special agents with the USPS OIG will work with our law enforcement partners to hold them responsible. To report fraud or other criminal activity involving the Postal Service, contact our special agents atwww.uspsoig.govor888-USPS-OIG.”According to the indictment, Indivior—including during the time when it was a subsidiary of RB Group—promoted the film version of Suboxone (Suboxone Film) to physicians, pharmacists, Medicaid administrators, and others across the country as less-divertible and less-abusable and safer around children, families, and communities than other buprenorphine drugs, even though such claims have never been established.The indictment further alleges that Indivior touted its “Here to Help” internet and telephone program as a resource for opioid-addicted patients. Instead, however, Indivior used the program, in part, to connect patients to doctors it knew were prescribing Suboxone and other opioids to more patients than allowed by federal law, at high doses, and in a careless and clinically unwarranted manner.The indictment also alleges that, to further its scheme, Indivior announced a “discontinuance” of its tablet form of Suboxone based on supposed “concerns regarding pediatric exposure” to tablets, despite Indivior executives’ knowledge that the primary reason for the discontinuance was to delay the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of generic tablet forms of the drug.The indictment alleges Indivior’s scheme was highly successful, fraudulently converting thousands of opioid-addicted patients over to Suboxone Film and causing state Medicaid programs to expand and maintain coverage of Suboxone Film at substantial cost to the government.The Civil SettlementUnder the civil settlement, RB Group has agreed to pay a total of $700 million to resolve claims that the marketing of Suboxone caused false claims to be submitted to government health care programs. The $700 million settlement amount includes $500 million to the federal government and up to $200 million to states that opt to participate in the agreement. The claims settled by the civil agreement are allegations only and there has been no determination of liability.The civil settlement addresses allegations by the United States that, from 2010 through 2014, RB Group directly or through its subsidiaries knowingly: (a) promoted the sale and use of Suboxone to physicians who were writing prescriptions without any counseling or psychosocial support and for uses that were unsafe, ineffective, and medically unnecessary and that were often diverted for uses that lacked a legitimate medical purpose; (b) promoted the sale or use of Suboxone Film to physicians and state Medicaid agencies using false and misleading claims that Suboxone Film was less susceptible to diversion and abuse than other buprenorphine products and that Suboxone Film was less susceptible to accidental pediatric exposure than tablets; and (c) submitted a petition to the Food and Drug Administration on Sept. 25, 2012, claiming that Suboxone Tablet had been discontinued “due to safety concerns” about the tablet formulation of the drug and took other steps to delay the entry of generic competition for Suboxone in order to improperly control pricing of Suboxone, including pricing to federal healthcare programs.“With the nation continuing to battle the opioid crisis, the availability of quality addiction treatment options is critical. When treatment medications are used, it is essential they be prescribed carefully, legally, and based on accurate information, to protect the health and safety of patients in federal healthcare programs,” said Gary L. Cantrell, Deputy Inspector General for Investigations at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “Along with our federal and state law enforcement partners we will continue working to protect these vulnerable beneficiaries.”“Opioid manufacturers – like all drug manufacturers – have a duty to market their products both truthfully and safely,” said Craig Carpenito, U.S. Attorney for New Jersey. “Opioid manufacturers have an additional and critically important duty to maintain effective controls to prevent their highly dangerous products from being abused and diverted.”“The opioid crisis has caused devastation throughout the country, including in the lives of Federal employees, annuitants, and their families,” said Thomas W. South, Deputy Assistant Inspector General for Investigations for the Office of Personnel Management. “The OPM OIG is committed to working with the Department of Justice and our other law enforcement partners to combat this epidemic. As always, patient safety is our number one priority.”The civil settlement resolves the claims against RB Group in six lawsuits pending in federal court in the Western District of Virginia and the District of New Jersey under the qui tam, or whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act, which allow private citizens to bring civil actions on behalf of the United States and share in any recovery.FTC ResolutionUnder a separate agreement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), RB Group has agreed to pay $50 million to resolve claims that it engaged in unfair methods of competition in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. § 53(b). The FTC is filing a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia alleging anticompetitive activities by RB Group designed to impede competition from generic equivalents of Suboxone. RB Group no longer manufactures or markets drug products. As part of a consent decree, RB Group agreed that it would notify the FTC if it began marketing drug products in the United States. RB Group further agreed that if it filed a Citizen Petition with the FDA in connection with a drug product, it would simultaneously disclose to both the FDA and the FTC all studies and data relevant to that Citizen Petition. RB Group further agreed not to withdraw a drug from the market or otherwise disadvantage a drug after obtaining approval to market another drug containing the same active ingredient.“Buprenorphine products are approved for use in the treatment of Americans struggling to overcome opioid addiction, and, in the middle of the nation’s opioid crisis, RB Group allegedly sought to deny those consumers a lower-cost generic alternative to maintain its lucrative monopoly on the branded drug,” said Gail Levine, a Deputy Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition.A Multilateral EffortThe criminal resolution with RB Group was handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia and the Department of Justice’s Consumer Protection Branch based on an investigation by the Virginia Attorney General’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit; FDA - Office of Criminal Investigation; United States Postal Service – Office of Inspector General; and Department of Health and Human Services - Office of Inspector General. The civil settlement was handled by the Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey. Assistance was provided by representatives of the HHS Office of Counsel to the Inspector General; the HHS Office of the General Counsel, CMS Division; FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel; the U.S. Department of Agriculture Office of the General Counsel; the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units; the Defense Criminal Investigative Service; the Office of Personnel Management - Office of Inspector General; the Department of Veterans’ Affairs Office of Inspector General; the Department of Labor - Office of Inspector General; and TRICARE Program Integrity.Attachment(s):Download forfeiture_settlement_agreement_exhibt_1_1.pdfDownload forfeiture_settlement_agreement_1.pdfDownload forfeiture_complaint.pdfDownload rbg_settlement_agreement_-_execution_copy_pdfTopic(s):OpioidsPrescription DrugsFalse Claims ActComponent(s):Civil DivisionPress Release Number:19-749"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeDistrict of Rhode IslandFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, July 18, 2019PROVIDENCE, RI – A Cranston man who admitted to collecting Social Security Supplemental Security Income (SSI) while at the same time depositing hundreds of thousands of dollars in his personal bank account and obtaining a home mortgage for more than a quarter million dollars was sentenced today to 18 months in federal prison and ordered to pay back funds he obtained fraudulently from the Social Security Administration.In addition to pleading guilty on June 25, 2018, to Social Security fraud, Raymond Walker, 48, pleaded guilty to attempt to possess with the intent to distribute Oxycodone, admitting to the court that he was trafficking Oxycodone.U.S. District Court Chief Judge William E. Smith today ordered Walker to serve 18 months in prison to be followed by 3 years supervised release. Walker was ordered to pay $14,301 restitution to the Social Security Administration (SSA).Walker’s sentence is announced by United States Attorney Aaron L. Weisman, Special Agent in Charge of the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI) Jeffrey J. Ebersole, and Scott E. Antolik, Special Agent in Charge of the Social Security Administration Office of Inspector General (SSA-OIG).According to information presented to the Court, Walker began receiving SSI benefits in 1992. SSI is meant to assist aged, blind, and disabled people who have little to no income.  To be eligible, one has to be disabled, unable to engage in substantial gainful activity, and have limited income and resources. SSA takes into account a claimant’s resources and allows an individual to hold up to $2,000 worth of resources.  “Income” includes money a claimant receives from work and other sources, such as friends and relatives.  The claimant must notify SSA of any significant changes in conditions affecting the receipt of benefits, to include work activity, as either an employee or self-employed individual.At the time of his guilty plea, Walker was receiving monthly SSI payments of $500 dollars.In September 2017, Walker was interviewed by a SSA claims specialist and informed the claims specialist that since July 2015 his only resources were a 1988 vehicle and a bank account with no more than $200 in it at any time. He told the interviewer that he received approximately $200 per month from family members to assist with personal expenses.However, an investigation by FDA-OCI, SSA-OIG, and the United States Attorney’s Office determined that between December 2013 and July 2017, Walker deposited $306,435 into his personal bank account; he held a $282,000 mortgage for a Cranston property, with a monthly mortgage payment of approximately $2,100; and he owned a 2016 Audi A8.When applying for the mortgage, Walker claimed to be employed as a construction project manager earning approximately $7,400 per month.Information was also developed by law enforcement that Walker was actively engaged in drug trafficking.  On October 4, 2017, at the direction of FDA-OCI agents, a cooperating witness met with Walker at Walker’s mother’s house and sold him two bottles containing inert 168 30 mg Oxycodone pills for $5,000. When the cooperating witness returned approximately 90 minutes later to receive payment for the pills, Walker informed the individual he had already received complaints regarding the strength of the pills. In that 90 minutes, agents observed Walker’s mother’s home and saw numerous individuals stopping in front of the house and engaging with Walker to purchase the pills.A court-authorized search of the residence that day resulted in the seizure of a money counter and $775 in cash. $5,000 was seized from inside a wheel compartment of his vehicle.The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Dulce Donovan.###Topic(s):Drug TraffickingFinancial FraudComponent(s):USAO - Rhode IslandContact:Jim Martin(401) 709-5357Press Release Number:19-90"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeSouthern District of IllinoisFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWednesday, July 17, 2019The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Illinois Prosecutes Dark Web Drug DistributorEarlier today, Brandon Arias pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois to conspiring to distribute fentanyl throughout the United States via the “dark web.” As part of his plea, the 34-year old from San Diego, California admitted that he was one of two individuals known on the dark web as “The Drug Llama,” and that he knowingly distributed misbranded fentanyl pills throughout the United States from October 2016 to August 2018.Fentanyl is a highly addictive and oftentimes lethal opioid painkiller.In January 2019, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of Illinois returned a superseding indictment charging Arias and his co-defendant, Melissa Scanlan, with conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, illegally distributing fentanyl (5 counts), selling counterfeit drugs, and misbranding drugs. Arias was arrested in San Diego and made his initial appearance in the Southern District of Illinois on March 12. At the time, he entered a not guilty plea and was ordered held without bond pending trial.In court today, Arias pleaded guilty to all eight charges pending against him, admitting that he and Scanlan created and maintained an account on “Dream Market,” a dark web marketplace for illegal substances and services. Through that account, Arias and Scanlan sold substantial quantities of narcotics while operating under the moniker, “The Drug Llama.” Arias further admitted being actively involved in Scanlan’s distribution of 1,000 fentanyl and acetyl fentanyl pills every week.The dark web is an underground computer network that is unreachable by traditional search engines and web browsers, creating a seeming anonymity to users. This false cloak has led to a proliferation of criminal activity on dark web marketplaces, like Dream Market.Despite the identity veil that the dark web seemingly provides, participants in illegal activity are not shielded from the long arm of the law. “People think they are anonymous when they use the dark web,” U.S. Attorney Weinhoeft commented, “but the drugs and money are here, in the real world, and our agents will work tirelessly to connect the illegal contraband to the criminals hiding within the shroud of the dark web.” U.S. Attorney Weinhoeft gave special recognition to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Criminal Investigations, whose agents worked to “pull the Drug Llama enterprise out of the shadows of the dark web.”“The opioid crisis has evolved and so has the nature of the threat, with potent synthetic opioids representing a sharply increasing amount of the total exposure to these drugs, further fueling the opioid addiction crisis,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “The FDA has expanded our enforcement efforts to include increased interdiction work aimed at stopping the illegal flow of counterfeit and unapproved prescription opioid drugs, like illicit fentanyl, online including on the dark web. We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who threaten the health and safety of Americans by illegally distributing prescription drugs.”“Drug traffickers who operate from the dark corners of the internet are not immune from arrest and prosecution” stated DEA Special Agent in Charge William Callahan of the St. Louis Division. “The men and women of the DEA and our law enforcement partners are well positioned to investigate, locate, and arrest cyber drug traffickers, and their co-conspirators, who spread their poison in the Greater St. Louis Metropolitan area, no matter where they operate from.”“The traditional drug dealing mechanics have changed, but law enforcement has changed with it,” said U.S. Attorney Robert S. Brewer, Jr., of the Southern District of California, who shared in U.S. Attorney Weinhoeft’s accolades of the multi-agency collaboration in this important prosecution. “This case, like others being prosecuted throughout the United States, demonstrates that hiding behind a cloak of anonymity on the dark web, no matter where you are, will be pierced and uncovered by investigators, and violators will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”Arias is scheduled to be sentenced on October 29, 2019, at the United States District Court in East St. Louis, Illinois. His sentence will be determined by the court and will be guided by the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Scanlan, 31, has pleaded not guilty and remains in federal custody awaiting her trial, currently set for August 27, 2019, in East St. Louis. Members of the public are reminded that all criminal defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.This case was part of a months-long, coordinated national operation involving the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Department of Homeland Security (HSI), United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California, and the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Illinois.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeWestern District of KentuckyFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, July 20, 2019PADUCAH, Ky. – United States District Court Senior Judge Thomas B. Russell sentenced Kyle W. Humphrey to two years imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release for stealing pre-retail prescription medications, mislabeling prescription medication in order to defraud or mislead, and wrongful use of health information; the defendant was also a prohibited person in possession of a firearm, announced United States Attorney Russell Coleman. Humphrey was also ordered to pay restitution of $21,216.94 to the three victim pharmacies in Kentucky, Illinois, and Idaho.“Western Kentucky families and patients are safer today because of this outcome,” stated U.S. Attorney Russell Coleman. “I am grateful for the professionalism and mission-focus of the FDA, Calloway County Sheriff’s Office, and ATF throughout this investigation and successful prosecution.”“Healthcare professionals who disrupt the FDA-regulated supply chain for prescription drugs put the health of all consumers at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Metro Washington Field Office.  “We will continue to investigate and bring to justice pharmacists and other healthcare professionals who abuse the trust of U.S. consumers and patients.”Humphrey, 34, plead guilty to the charges on March 27, 2019.According to a plea agreement, On August 9, 2017, the Calloway County Sheriff's Department executed a search warrant at Humphrey's residence, seizing various quantities of prescription-only restricted drugs (pre-retail medical products). Seized drugs include Eliquis® (apixaban); Strattera® (atomoxetine HCl);ProAir® HF A (albuterol sulfate); Farxiga® (dapagliflozin); Cefprozil; Tamiflu®; Duloxetine;Aripiprazole; Ergocalciferol; Levofloxacin; Bystolic® (nebivolol); Xarelto® (rivaroxaban); Clindamycin Palmitate HCL; Mylan® Norethindrone tablets; Camila® Norethindrone tablets; Testosterone Gel tubes; and Testosterone Cypionate. These substances are prescription medicines regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Humphrey was at all relevant times a pharmacist working at various pharmacies in the area. He stole these drugs from the pharmacies and concealed them at his residence.On or about April 9, 2017, Humphrey knowingly and unlawfully obtained the personally identifiable health information of \"SC\" by printing a duplicate prescription label containing the personally identifiable health information of \"SC\" in furtherance of his duplicate label scheme. After printing this duplicate label, Humphrey affixed this duplicate label to an amber-colored prescription bottle and proceeded to fill this bottle with allopurinol stolen from his employer, Walmart. This conduct was done for personal gain. Sometime after filling this prescription bottle with stolen allopurinol, Humphrey removed a portion of the duplicate label so as to conceal his crime. This conduct caused the allopurinol bottle to be misbranded because the labeling on that prescription bottle was false or misleading. This dispensing was done with the intent to defraud Walmart.The Benton Walmart pharmacy dispensing logs covering December 2016 and April 2017 indicate that Humphrey was working at the Benton Walmart on December 29, 2016 (the date a prescription was issued to \"PB\"). On July 17, 2017, HUMPHREY continued to maintain possession of the bottle, with intent to use it for personal gain. \"PB\" did not give any of her benzonatate to him nor did she ever give him a prescription bottle containing her personally identifiable medical information, nor did she give him permission to possess her personally identifiable medical information outside the scope of his employment.On August 17, 2017, the Calloway County Family Court issued a Domestic Violence Order restraining Humphrey from further contact with M.R. The Order issued after a hearing of which he received actual notice, and at which he had an opportunity to participate, restraining him from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner, and that by its terms explicitly prohibited the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against such intimate partner that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury. On January 2, 2018, when Humphrey was subject to the Order, the Calloway County Sheriff’s Office arrested Humphrey for violation of the order, at which time he was in possession of a Sig Sauer 9 mm handgun.On August 20, 2018, the District Court of the First Judicial District of the State of Idaho issued an Order restraining Humphrey from further contact with H.B. The Order issued after a hearing of which he received actual notice, and at which he had an opportunity to participate, restraining him from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner, and that by its terms explicitly prohibited the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against such intimate partner that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury. On September 18, 2018, when Humphrey was subject to the Order, federal authorities arrested Humphrey, at which time he was in possession of a Glock 23 .40 caliber pistol.The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Madison Sewell. The Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations led the investigation with assistance from Calloway County Sherriff’s Department, and the Kentucky Board of Pharmacy. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) also assisted in the investigation.####Topic(s):Prescription DrugsComponent(s):USAO - Kentucky, Western"

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeEastern District of VirginiaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, July 18, 2019NEWPORT NEWS, Va. – A Poquson man pleaded guilty today to his participation in a lucrative conspiracy to violate the Lacey Act and falsely labelling millions of dollars-worth of foreign crab meat as “Product of USA”.“As I stated when his father was convicted, the Caseys conspired to replace Atlantic Blue Crab with crab meat from Indonesia, China, Thailand, Vietnam, and Central and South America,” said G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. “Casey falsely labeled nearly 400,000 pounds of crab meat with a retail value in the millions of dollars. This fraud causes real financial harm to the fragile, maritime economies here in the region, and threatens to tarnish the good name of the watermen and women who have worked this estuary for generations. We are committed to working with our federal and state partners to ensure compliance with the Lacey Act, and to enforce our nation’s environmental laws that are in place to protect consumers from similar fraud schemes.”According to court documents, Michael P. Casey, 42, was the Vice President for Marketing and Operations of Casey’s Seafood Inc., a wholesale processor of crab meat and other seafood. He pleaded guilty to conspiring with James R. Casey and others to substitute foreign crab meat for Atlantic blue crab. James Casey, the owner and President of Casey’s Seafood, also pleaded guilty and was sentenced in January to a 48-month term of imprisonment.“By illegally mislabeling hundreds of thousands of pounds of crab meat, the defendant intentionally undermined the local crab processing industry – defrauding customers and, in turn, damaging the public’s trust in an industry that is important to the local economy,\" said Jeffrey Bossert Clark, Assistant Attorney General for Environment and Natural Resources Division. “Mr. Casey’s actions are an affront to those who play by the rules when selling blue crab, and The Department will continue to work closely with its partners to prosecute criminals who flout the rule of law.”As part of the plea, Michael Casey admitted to knowing that Casey’s Seafood employees were directed to unpack foreign crab meat from containers and re-package that meat into containers bearing the company name and which were labeled “Product of USA.” falsely labeling more than 183 tons of crab meat, which was then sold to grocery stores and independent retailers. Casey also admitted to aiding and abetting James Casey in selling at least 367,765 pounds of crab meat falsely labeled “Product of USA,” with a total wholesale value of approximately $4,324,916.“Seafood fraud undermines the economic viability of U.S. and global fisheries, deceives consumers, and threatens the health of those who consume tainted or misidentified seafood products,” said James Landon, Director of NOAA's Office of Law Enforcement. “This case is a great example of investigative cooperation by state and federal law enforcement to strengthen seafood fraud detection and safeguard the industry and consumers.”A significant decline in Atlantic blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) harvests that began in 2010 made it increasingly expensive to purchase live Atlantic blue crab and increasingly difficult to profit from the labor-intensive process of picking meat from live-harvested blue crab. As part of his guilty plea, Casey admitted that, because of this decline, he and the company could not and did not process sufficient quantities of Atlantic blue crab to meet customer demands. To make up the shortfall, the co-conspirators used foreign crab meat to fulfill customer orders. During the periods when the company did not process blue crab—which sometimes lasted three months—the co-conspirators purchased crab meat (not live crabs) from Indonesia, China, Thailand, Vietnam, and other foreign locales.“U.S. consumers expect the origin of their seafood to be correctly identified. When sellers attempt to deceive the public about their product’s origins, they put the public’s health at risk by introducing seafood of unknown origin,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Office. “When sellers are deceptive about their products’ origins, they deprive the public of important information about their purchasing decisions. We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who put profits above fair dealing.”The crab meat from Indonesia, China, Thailand, and Vietnam included meat from Portunus pelagicus, Portunus haanii, and Ovalipes punctatus, which are all Indo-West Pacific species of crab that do not live in the continental waters of the United States. The company also purchased crab meat (not live crabs) from Central American sources, which did include Atlantic blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, but also included other species such as Callinectes bocourti, Callinectes bellicosis, Callinectes toxotes, and Callinectes arcuatus.As part of the guilty plea, Casey further admitted that beginning at least as early as 2010, and continuing through June 17, 2015, he was aware that company employees had been directed to unpack foreign crab meat from suppliers’ containers, comingle it with domestic blue crab and/or other types of crab, and re-pack that crab meat into Casey’s Seafood containers, all of which were labeled “Product of USA”.As part of the plea, Casey admitted that part of the conspiracy was to purchase discounted foreign crab meat, some of which was referred to as “distressed” because it was approaching or beyond its posted “best used by” dates. Casey admitted to knowing that company employees “re-conditioned” the “distressed” crab meat by re-pasteurizing it, and then packaging the “re-conditioned” meat into the company’s containers, which were labeled and sold as blue crab and “Product of USA.” Casey also was aware that employees placed labels with “Product of USA” on containers that concealed labels marked as “Product of China” and “Product of Brazil”.Casey pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the Lacey Act and faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison when sentenced on November 14. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.This case was part of an ongoing effort by the Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Law Enforcement, in coordination with the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, the Virginia Marine Police, and the Department of Justice to detect, deter, and prosecute those engaged in the false labeling of crab meat.G.

Ceron will appear before U.S. Magistrate Court Judge Donald L. Cabell on Aug. 8, 2019. Ceron was previously charged by criminal complaint on May 15, 2019.According to the charging documents, Ceron, who operated her business in Lawrence, has been obtaining “gluteal material” from a source in Florida for over eight years. During a search executed at the source’s residence in 2016, plastic bottles of suspected cosmetic silicone fillers were sized. Lab tests subsequently confirmed that those fillers contained silicone oil, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns can travel through blood vessels and cause a stroke, death or permanent disfigurement.In 2018, a cooperating witness working with agents began making recorded phone calls to Ceron in order to arrange for buttock enhancing and facial injections. During a recorded meeting on May 24, 2018, Ceron allegedly told the cooperating witness that she charges $500 for buttock injections and $60 for each wrinkle-filling injection. A search of Ceron’s business in Lawrence in June 2018 resulted in the seizure of several bottles and syringes of a substance that tests revealed to be silicone oil. Numerous uncapped, used, syringes were also recovered from the business.The indictment further alleges that Ceron performed illegal injections to augment the buttock or fill wrinkles of three other women in exchange for money, and that she misled her victims about her qualifications, and the identity and safety of the material that she was injecting.Members of the public who believe they may be a victim of this crime should contactusama.VictimAssistance@usdoj.gov.The charging statute provides for a sentence of up to three years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseDecember 10, 2018United States Department of JusticeOlympus Medical Systems Corporation (Olympus) and a former senior executive in Japan pleaded guilty today in Newark, New Jersey, to failing to file required adverse event reports involving infections connected to duodenoscopes, and to continuing to sell the duodenoscopes in the United States despite those failures, the Justice Department announced today.Olympus, which is located in Tokyo, Japan, and Hisao Yabe, 62, of Japan, both entered guilty pleas before U.S. District Court Judge Stanley R. Chesler in Newark Federal Court: Olympus to three counts, and Yabe to one count, of distributing misbranded medical devices in interstate commerce in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA).Judge Chesler also imposed sentence on the company today – fining Olympus $80,000,000 and ordering $5,000,000 in criminal forfeiture, consistent with a plea agreement between Olympus and the Justice Department.  Olympus must also abide by an agreement with the Justice Department requiring Olympus to enact extensive compliance reforms.Yabe is scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Chesler on March 27, 2019. Yabe faces a maximum potential penalty of a year in prison and a $100,000 fine, or twice the gain or loss from the offense.Olympus admitted that it failed to file with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required adverse event reports in 2012 and 2013 relating to three separate events involving infections in Europe connected to Olympus’s TJF-Q180V duodenoscope (Q180V): the infection of approximately 22 patients withPseudomonas aeruginosaat the Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands in early 2012; the infection of three patients withEscherichia coliat Clinique de Bercy in France in November 2012; and the infection of five patients withPseudomonas aeruginosaat Kremlin Bicetre in France in July 2012.Yabe admitted his own personal responsibility for the failure to file the necessary information with FDA relating to the Erasmus Medical Center infections.  At the time, Yabe was Olympus’s Division Manager for the Quality and Environment Division – Olympus’s top regulatory official, whose responsibilities included adverse event reporting in the United States.“Medical devices, such as the Olympus duodenoscope that is used in 500,000 procedures per year in the United States, can extend and improve the quality of life for many people,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt for the Department of Justice’s Civil Division.  “But when a device manufacturer becomes aware of risks that could lead to illness, injury, or death, there is a statutory obligation to report that information to the FDA in a timely manner. By failing to do so, Olympus and Mr. Yabe put patients’ health at risk.”“Olympus and Yabe failed to file important FDA reports regarding adverse events,” Attorney for the United States Rachael Honig, District of New Jersey, said. “It is especially troubling that they remained quiet when they received additional information from an independent expert questioning the safety of Olympus’ device. Patient safety must always be a paramount concern for medical device companies, and these defendants simply failed to treat that concern with the gravity it deserves. Today’s resolution is a reminder that this office will act whenever patient safety is put at risk by a quest for profits.”“Medical device adverse event reporting requirements are designed to protect Americans by providing FDA with a tool to detect potential safety issues.  When device manufacturers fail to report adverse events, unsuspecting patients are placed at risk,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “We take our patient safety mission very seriously and we remain fully committed to aggressively pursuing those who jeopardize public health by subverting FDA’s regulatory requirements.”Olympus’s and Yabe’s Failure to File Required Adverse Event ReportsTo enable FDA and others to identify and monitor adverse events, the FDCA requires medical device manufacturers to file adverse event reports – known as Medical Device Reports (MDRs) – when the manufacturer becomes aware of information that reasonably suggests that the manufacturer’s device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury.  The FDCA also requires manufacturers to file supplemental MDRs if they subsequently obtain information about the event that was not known or available when the initial MDR was filed.Olympus today admitted that it failed to make the required initial MDR filing regarding the Kremlin Bicetre infections, and failed to file required supplemental MDRs relating to the Erasmus Medical Center and Clinique de Bercy infections, for which Olympus had filed initial MDRs.  Under the FDCA, devices for which required MDRs and supplemental MDRs have not been filed are deemed misbranded, and it is a crime to ship such devices in interstate commerce.  Between August 2012 and October 2014, Olympus shipped hundreds of misbranded duodenoscopes in the United States, generating approximately $40 million in revenue and approximately $33 million in total gross profit.  Olympus’s payment of $85 million is more than 2½ times Olympus’s total profit from sales of the misbranded duodenoscopes.Yabe admitted today that he was aware of Olympus’s obligation to file supplemental MDRs and was involved in Olympus’s failure to file a supplemental MDR regarding the Erasmus Medical Center infections and a report Olympus received prepared by an independent expert of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.  That expert report – which Olympus obtained in the summer of 2012 – noted numerous problems with the Q180V, including that the Q180V’s tip had various cracks, corners, and crevices that could harbor bacteria and could be cleaned only with great difficulty.  The report recommended immediate further investigation of all such scopes, updating the cleaning instructions, and improving the quality of the seals.Additional Compliance MeasuresAs part of its plea agreement with the Justice Department, Olympus has agreed to: retain an independent MDR expert to inspect and review Olympus’s policies and procedures to determine their compliance with the MDR requirements of the FDCA and its implementing regulations; periodic review by the MDR expert of Olympus’s continued compliance with the MDR requirements of the FDCA and its implementing regulations; and conduct a review and audit of the device classification and market pathway for all endoscope device types manufactured by Olympus that are intended for use in the sterile body cavity and that are currently sold in the United States.  The MDR expert will report back to FDA and the Justice Department periodically for three years.  In addition, the President of Olympus and Olympus’s Board of Directors will periodically conduct a review of Olympus’s MDR compliance measures and classification/marketing pathway review and provide certifications to FDA and the Justice Department relating to those reviews.  Olympus also is obligated to inform health care providers in the United States who received Q180Vs between August 2012 and October 2014 of Olympus’s plea today, and to provide information to those health care providers regarding Olympus’s failure to file the required MDRs.In March 2016, Olympus Corp. of the Americas and Olympus Latin America, two separate subsidiaries of Olympus Corp., entered into deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) and civil settlements with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey and the Justice Department’s Civil Division to resolve criminal and civil charges and civil claims relating to schemes between 2006-2011 to pay kickbacks to doctors and hospitals in the United States and violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in Latin America. The DPAs are scheduled to expire in March 2019. While the unlawful conduct at issue in today’s resolution terminated in October 2014 – a year and a half before the government entered into the DPAs – conduct relating to violations of the FDCA and failure to file MDRs was specifically not covered by the March 2016 resolution, as the investigation into the FDCA violations was ongoing at that time.The guilty pleas are the culmination of an investigation conducted by special agents from FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey J. Ebersole of the New York Field Office, along with special agents from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Scott J. Lampert, and special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Gregory W. Ehrie.The government is represented in the criminal case by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jacob T. Elberg and R. David Walk, Jr. of the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s Health Care and Government Fraud Unit, and Senior Litigation Counsel Patrick Jasperse of the Justice Department’s Consumer Protection Branch, with the assistance of Senior Counsel Shannon M.

Christine, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia. Two of those charged in the indictment also are charged with felony murder in Walton County, Ga., in the beating and suffocation death of a suspected co-conspirator.Charged in the indictment are:·Walker Christian Forrester, 24, of Loganville, Ga., andKolbie Hadden Watters, 22, of Augusta, Ga., charged with Conspiracy to Possess with Intent to Distribute and to Distribute Controlled Substances; Using or Maintaining a Drug Premises; Possession with Intent to Distribute Controlled Substances; Possession of a Firearm in Furtherance of a Drug Trafficking Crime; Possession of an Unregistered Firearm; and Conspiracy to Commit Money Laundering. If convicted on all charges, the two face sentences of up to life in prison.·Larry Overton, 46, of Harlem, Ga., charged with Conspiracy to Possess with Intent to Distribute and to Distribute Controlled Substances, and Using or Maintaining a Drug Premises. If convicted, he faces a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.·Jonathan Britt Lester, 22, of Loganville, Ga.;Armand Sananda Saedi, 27, of Atlanta, Ga., andMorgan McKenzie Slaton, 22, of Hoschton, Ga., each are charged with Conspiracy to Possess with Intent to Distribute and to Distribute Controlled Substances, and if convicted each face sentences of up to five years in prison.Each of the defendants, if convicted, also would be subject to substantial fines and terms of supervised release after completion of any prison sentences. There is no parole in the federal system.According to the indictment, and from testimony delivered in court proceedings, Forrester first came to the attention of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration around Sept. 2017 after he purchased an industrial-grade pill press. Two months later, Forrester, Watters and a juvenile were arrested on state charges in Harlem, Ga., in November 2017 after a traffic stop in which Harlem police officers found more than 5,200 counterfeit Xanax pills, marijuana and a sawed-off shotgun in the vehicle.In addition to pill presses, investigators allege Forrester also purchased punch dies used to create counterfeit Xanax pills, Alprazolam as the main ingredient, and binding agents to manufacture tens of thousands of pills per month. The illicit ingredients were purchased on the Dark Web using cryptocurrency, with the counterfeit Xanax likewise sold on the Dark Web or through conventional illegal drug distribution channels.The conspirators moved the four pill presses to various locations in the Southern, Northern and Middle Districts of Georgia to avoid detection, and at one point began manufacturing and selling synthetic heroin using Fentanyl and the more-powerful Carfentanil. Overton, who is alleged to have housed one of the pill presses at his Harlem home in return for drugs, was briefly hospitalized during the investigation after overdosing on the synthetic opioids.In addition to charges in the drug conspiracy, Watters and Lester also face state charges in Walton County of felony murder and aggravated assault in the death of Chase David Loffler, 25, whose body was found buried in the backyard of Lester’s Loganville home in April 2018. The two are accused of beating and suffocating Loffler, a suspected co-conspirator, and burying his body in a shallow grave.“This case highlights the growing threat of drug trafficking and its associated violent crime fueled by cyber technology,” said Bobby L. Christine, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia. “Our federal, state and local law enforcement agencies will continue to overcome these challenges, however, and bring to justice anyone who would distribute poison in our communities.”Robert J. Murphy, Special Agent in Charge of the Atlanta Drug Enforcement Administration Office stated, “Synthetic opioids, Fentanyl and counterfeit pills continue to be a threat in our communities, and DEA is committed to working with all our law enforcement partners in targeting organizations and individuals that produce and distribute this poison.”“Opioid abuse is a crisis in our communities and we will continue to be committed to targeting those who compound the problem,” said Chris Hacker, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. “This case is an example of what can be accomplished when federal, state and local law enforcement agencies and their resources are combined to fight this national trend.”“Illegal opioid production and distribution, whether online or through conventional drug distribution methods, is contributing to the public health emergency of the opioid addiction crisis that has ripped apart families and communities,” said Melinda K. Plaisier, Food and Drug Administration Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs. “The FDA will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to aggressively pursue and bring to justice those who threaten the health and safety of Americans consumers.”“American communities are being ravaged by a steady influx of illegal and deadly narcotics smuggled into the U.S.; chief amongst them heroin and the synthetic opioid fentanyl,” said HSI Atlanta Special Agent in Charge Nick S. Annan. “HSI is firmly committed to targeting the illegal import and sale of opioids, following the money trails, and leveraging our transnational partnerships to stop criminal networks and prevent the opioid crisis from spreading.”“This is just a small piece of the puzzle in a growing opioid and pill mill problem in the state of Georgia. This scheme involved cryptocurrency and the Dark Web. It also involved other alleged criminal activity touching all three judicial districts within Georgia as those involved showed the lengths they were willing to go to commit various crimes,” said Thomas J. Holloman, Special Agent in Charge of IRS-Criminal Investigations for the Atlanta Field Office. “We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners in following the money in an effort to dismantle illegal pill mill operations in our state.”An indictment contains only charges. Defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.The case is being investigated under the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF), the centerpiece of the United States Attorney General’s drug strategy to reduce the availability of drugs by disrupting and dismantling major drug trafficking and money laundering organizations and related criminal enterprises. Agencies involved in the investigation include the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the U.S. Army Criminal Investigative Division (CID), the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the U.S. Marshals Service, and the Harlem Department of Public Safety.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseApril 11, 2019United States Department of JusticeA jury yesterday convicted Paul J. Elmer, the former CEO and owner of Pharmakon Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Pharmakon), of conspiracy to defraud the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and nine counts of adulterating drugs, the Department of Justice announced today. Pharmakon was a Noblesville, Indiana, drug compounding facility.The verdict came after an eight-day trial before U.S. District Judge James R. Sweeney II in Indianapolis, Indiana.Elmer, 67, formerly a licensed pharmacist and a resident of Fishers, Indiana, was charged by grand jury in a superseding indictment on Feb. 7, 2019. The superseding indictment charged that, from 2013 to 2016, Elmer and Caprice R. Bearden, Pharmakon’s former director of compliance, caused Pharmakon ─ which compounded sterile, intravenous drugs ─ to distribute approximately 70 lots of over- and under-potent drugs to military and civilian hospitals throughout the country.“As these convictions show, the Department of Justice takes very seriously conduct that unlawfully undermines the safety of compounded drugs,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Civil Division. “We will not tolerate actions that impede the FDA’s efforts to ensure the safety of products. With its law enforcement partners, the Department of Justice will thoroughly investigate and prosecute those who knowingly prevent the FDA from protecting patients and ensuring compounded drugs are safe.”“The jury’s findings in this case resonate with citizens of every age,” said Josh J. Minkler, United States Attorney. “Specifically, hospitals and patients from every walk of life rely on the integrity of pharmaceutical manufacturers like Pharmakon to make safe drugs. This defendant prioritized profit over safety and the jury’s verdict demonstrates the government’s resolve to protect our citizens. Good pharmaceutical manufacturers, who work with the FDA achieve that goal.”“Producing unsafe drugs puts patients at risk and is particularly concerning when they reach already vulnerable populations such as premature infants. This conviction demonstrates that those, including drug compounders, who distribute harmful drugs will be held accountable under the law,” said Director Catherine A. Hermsen, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations. “The FDA continues to play an important role in protecting patients—including young children—and we will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to pursue and bring to justice those who place profits before the health of U.S. patients.”“When drug compounders disregard safety standards and violate the law, patient health can be put at significant risk. In this case, we saw unacceptable behavior from the defendant whose company distributed dangerous products that led to serious adverse events in infants,” said Stacy Amin, FDA Chief Counsel. “The FDA is fully committed to working with the Department of Justice to stop these bad actors and protect patients from potential public health risks.”Beardenpleaded guiltyto all the charges in the original indictment on Nov. 21, 2017.  Her sentencing date has not been scheduled.Evidence at Elmer’s trial showed that, from 2013 to 2016, Pharmakon routinely shipped compounded drugs at Elmer’s direction to customers without having received laboratory test results that verified the drugs were the strength they were supposed to be. Furthermore, evidence showed that, despite receiving test results showing potency failures, Elmer did not recall the drugs, notify the customer, notify the FDA of the potency failures, or conduct any root cause investigation to determine the cause of the failure.FDA consumer safety officers testified about two inspections of Pharmakon they conducted in 2014. One inspection was prompted by Pharmakon’s distribution of 200 percent potent midazolam, a sedative that was used to treat premature infants, to an Indianapolis hospital.  They observed numerous violations of FDA regulations during each inspection, and informed Elmer. But former Pharmakon employees testified that Elmer and Bearden misled and interfered with these first two FDA inspections, in order to prevent the FDA from knowing about the potency failures as well as other aspects of the business. Former employees also testified that certain changes in process that Elmer and Bearden told the FDA Pharmakon would enact, never happened.According to evidence at trial, in February 2016, the multiple potency failures culminated in Pharmakon’s distribution of 2,460 percent super potent morphine sulfate, an opioid pain medication, to hospitals in Indianapolis and Chicago. Nurses at the Indianapolis hospital administered the morphine, not knowing that it was 2,460 percent super potent, to infants in the pediatric unit.  Three infants suffered adverse effects from the narcotic overdose. One infant needed to be revived through the administration of Naloxone (commonly known as Narcan) and sent by helicopter to a nearby hospital with a neo-natal intensive care unit. These adverse events led to a final FDA inspection in which FDA consumer safety officers testified that they discovered evidence of multiple previous potency failures that had been concealed by Bearden during the first two inspections. Former employees testified that Elmer and Bearden misled and interfered with this final FDA inspection as well.Elmer was convicted of one felony count of conspiracy to defraud the FDA and to obstruct FDA inspections, carrying a maximum punishment of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. He was also convicted of three misdemeanor counts of introducing adulterated drugs into interstate commerce and six misdemeanor counts of adulterating drugs while held for sale after shipment of a drug component in interstate commerce. Each of the adulteration counts is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of $100,000.Elmer’s sentencing date has not been scheduled.Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt and U.S. Attorney Minkler commended the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, which conducted the investigation.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeWestern District of VirginiaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, April 9, 2019Company Allegedly Lied to Doctors and Public Health Care Benefit Programs About the Safety and Diversion Risks of Suboxone FilmA federal grand jury sitting in Abingdon, Virginia, has indicted Indivior Inc. (formerly known as Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.) and Indivior PLC (Indivior) for engaging in an illicit nationwide scheme to increase prescriptions of Suboxone Film, an opioid drug used in the treatment of opioid addiction, the Department of Justice announced.According to the indictment, Indivior obtained billions of dollars in revenue from Suboxone Film prescriptions by deceiving health care providers and health care benefit programs into believing that Suboxone Film was safer, less divertible, and less abusable than other opioid-addiction treatment drugs. Indivior also is alleged to have sought to boost profits by using a “Here to Help” program to connect opioid-addicted patients to doctors the company knew were prescribing opioids at high rates and in a clinically unwarranted manner.“The deadly opioid epidemic continues to devastate communities and families across our nation,” said Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Jesse Panuccio of the Department of Justice. “The Department of Justice intends to hold accountable those who are in position to know the harm opioid abuse inflicts, but instead choose to profit illegally from the pain of others.  Manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies, and doctors should all be on notice that they must follow the law and act responsibly.”“Opioid addiction is a national epidemic. The indictment alleges that, rather than marketing its opioid-addiction drug responsibly, Indivior promoted it with a disregard for the truth about its safety and despite known risks of diversion and abuse,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt. “The Department of Justice is committed to holding opioid manufacturers accountable for such unlawful conduct.”According to the indictment, Indivior developed Suboxone Film around 2007 as a patent-protected alternative to the tablet form of Suboxone, which was then about to face generic drug competition. The primary ingredient in both Suboxone Film and tablets is buprenorphine, a highly potent opioid. Indivior promoted Suboxone Film as safer and less-divertible than its tablet form, even though the company lacked any scientific evidence to support those claims. In particular, Indivior aggressively marketed Suboxone Film, without an established basis, as having a “lower risk of child exposure” and a “less divertible/abusable formulation.”  Indivior made these and other false and misleading claims in marketing materials and through representations to physicians, pharmacists, and health care benefit programs throughout the country. The indictment also alleges that, to further its scheme, Indivior announced a “discontinuance” of its tablet form of Suboxone based on supposed “concerns regarding pediatric exposure to” tablets, when in fact Indivior executives knew the primary reason for the discontinuance was to delay the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of generic tablet forms of the drug.The indictment further alleges that Indivior used its “Here to Help” internet and telephone program as part of its scheme to induce physicians to write prescriptions for Suboxone Film. Touted as a resource for opioid-addicted patients, Indivior used the program in part to connect patients to doctors it knew were prescribing Suboxone and other opioids to more patients than allowed by federal law, at high doses, and in suspect circumstances. The indictment alleges that Indivior executives and employees knew from statistical and numerous firsthand reports that some doctors in the Here to Help referral system were issuing prescriptions in a careless and clinically unwarranted manner.Indivior’s scheme, as asserted in the indictment, was highly successful, converting thousands of opioid-addicted patients over to Suboxone Film and causing state Medicaid programs to expand and maintain coverage of Suboxone Film at substantial cost to the government. Until earlier this year, when Suboxone Film became subject to generic competition, Indivior retained a high portion of the opioid-addiction treatment market.The indictment charges Indivior with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, mail fraud, and health care fraud. In addition, the indictment charges the company with one count of health care fraud, four counts of mail fraud, and twenty-two counts of wire fraud. An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.“As this case makes clear, our office will aggressively prosecute health care fraud cases and particularly those that target people struggling with opioid addiction,” First Assistant United States Attorney Daniel P. Bubar of the Western District of Virginia said today. “We are grateful for the tireless investigative work of our partners at FDA, Virginia Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, HHS, and the U.S. Postal Service for taking on these types of important investigations.”“Our indictment alleges a wide-ranging and truly shameful scheme to put profits over the health and well-being of patients trying to manage substance use disorder and opioid dependence,” said Attorney General Mark R. Herring. “It’s incredibly frustrating that while we have been working to remove the stigma around medication-assisted treatment and make it more widely available, Indivior was allegedly conspiring to exploit patients, taxpayers, and the expansion of MAT. My team and I are proud to have helped lead this investigation, and look forward to helping bring it to a just and fair conclusion.”“Opioid addiction is a public health emergency and medication-assisted opioid treatment options are an important tool for combatting this crisis. This investigation revealed that Indivior tried to mislead FDA and game the system by attempting to bar competition for Suboxone from the market,” said Melinda K. Plaisier, FDA Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who participate in these schemes to the detriment of public health.The United States Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia and the Department of Justice’s Consumer Protection Branch are prosecuting the case. The case was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, the Virginia Attorney General’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Inspector General, and United States Postal Service Office of Inspector General.

Conway, of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations.Pleading guilty was Curtis Wenzlaff, 55.According to court records, Curtis Wenzlaff operated a domestic profit corporation, Sanno Industries, Inc., out of his residence previously located in Flushing, Michigan.  Wenzlaff was acting as a drop shipper for companies outside the United States and was paid to assume the risk and consequences of the U.S. government identifying, seizing, and refusing entry of products illegally imported in to the United States.Beginning in July 2014 and continuing until April 2016, Wenzlaff was involved with smuggling into the United States products commonly used to make drugs regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The products were falsely labeled, among other things, as blueberry extract and sunscreen lotion ingredients.  Wenzlaff would accept delivery of the packages.  Once a product was successfully delivered to Wenzlaff, other individuals would then provide him with instructions regarding relabeling, repackaging and shipping the product to the intended customer.  Wenzlaff received in excess of $25,000 from shippers to receive and reship the packages.  Defendant claims that a portion of the money received was reimbursement for shipping expenses associated with the imported product.Wenzlaff knew that the merchandise imported into the United States was not intended for the uses he claimed on shipping documents.  Even so, he knowingly received the product and then concealed it in order to facilitate the sale of the merchandise to a third party.  The value of the merchandise/products illegally smuggled into the United States by Wenzlaff was in excess of $1,000,000.00.“I commend the agents of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations for their work on this case,” stated United States Attorney Schneider. “Our office is always working to protect Michigan consumers from harm, and that’s especially true in cases where people try to evade federal health and safety regulations in exchange for their own personal profits.”“FDA regulations are in place to protect consumers and help ensure the drug products they receive are safe and effective,” said Special Agent in Charge William P. Conway, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Chicago Field Office. “When unscrupulous importers attempt to evade FDA’s regulations, consumers in the U.S. are put at risk. The FDA will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who participate in fraudulent smuggling schemes to the detriment of public health.”Wenzlaff’s plea agreement provides for an anticipated sentencing guideline range of 24-30 months’ imprisonment. Wenzlaff entered his guilty plea before U.S. District Judge Matthew Leitman in Flint, Michigan. Sentencing has been set for August 8, 2019 at 1:30 p.m..The case was investigated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Nancy Abraham.Topic(s):Consumer ProtectionComponent(s):USAO - Michigan, Eastern"

Greenberg. United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida andJustin D. Green, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Food & Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA OCI), Miami Field Office, made the announcement.Flores previously pled guilty to participating in a conspiracy, which sought to sell and dispense and cause the sale and dispensing of a counterfeit tobacco product, to wit cigarettes, the containers and labeling of which, without authorization, bore the trade names of Marlboro Reds and Newport cigarettes, tobacco products listed with the FDA pursuant to Title 21, United States Code, Section 387(e)(i)(1), in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Sections 331(qq)(3) and 333(a)(2), all in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371.According to the court record, including a jointly filed factual statement, the investigation began in January 28, 2013, when a FDA/OCI undercover agent met with Flores in Jamaica to discuss the sale of counterfeit Marlboro brand cigarettes. Thereafter, negotiating by email, a deal to sell and ship 1,100 “master cases” of counterfeit Marlboro Reds, for a total cost of $377,300.00 was reached. To pursue the deal, agents made an initial a wire transfer in the amount of $133,190 to an account located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates for the purchase of the counterfeit cigarettes.In August 2013, undercover agents met with a previously sentenced co-defendant Gaurav Jayaseelan, who travelled to Miami to discuss the pending sale.  During the recorded meeting, Jayaseelan told the agents that he and his father, were in the cigarette and alcohol business and claimed they owned their own tobacco manufacturing plant which could manufacture any tobacco brand. Jayaseelan later sent an email offering to provide counterfeit Newport cigarettes within four to five weeks. Subsequently, at Jayaseelan’s request, two cartons of Newport cigarettes to be used as samples for the manufacturing of the counterfeits were provided to an address in India.In January 2014, Jayaseelan emailed that they would send 1,030 master cases of Newport cigarettes for a total wholesale price of $450,625.  In May 2014, the shipment was seized at Port Everglades, in coordination with t. The counterfeit cigarettes had an estimated U.S. street value of more than $5.6 million. Throughout the conspiracy, Flores, by internet communications, served as a broker and a facilitator of the sales activity.Flores was arrested in Peru in early 2017 and extradited to the United States.Counterfeit cigarettes, which are sold without proper registration and testing may pose a greater health risk than consumers recognize, due to the presence of contaminants either not found in products originating from the lawful manufacturers, or which are present in greater concentrations.Mr. Greenberg commended the investigative efforts of FDA-OCI and thanked the U.S. Customs and Border Protection,U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations,Peruvian Ministry of Justice and U.S. Marshals Service for their assistance in this matter.  This matter was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Watts-FitzGerald.A copy of this press release may be found on the website of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida atwww.usdoj.gov/usao/fls.

Fostich, 36, of Kansas City, Mo., was charged in a two-count indictment returned under seal by a federal grand jury in Kansas City, Mo., on Tuesday, March 27, 2018. That indictment was unsealed and made public today upon Fostich’s arrest and initial court appearance.Fostich is charged with one count of obtaining a controlled substance by fraud (related to the theft of fentanyl and morphine) and one count of tampering with a consumer product (related to the replacement of fentanyl with another substance).Fostich was employed at the Kansas City Fire Department (KCFD) as a paramedic from August 2014 to Dec. 11, 2016. Fostich had access to fentanyl and morphine, which were stored in sealed narcotics boxes and locked in safes on KCFD ambulances. Each sealed narcotics box contained two vials of fentanyl, each containing 100 micrograms of liquid fentanyl, two syringes of morphine, each containing 10 milligrams of liquid morphine, and two vials containing 5 milligrams of liquid midazolam. As a paramedic, Fostich was able to unlock the electronic safe and open the sealed narcotics boxes in order to administer controlled substances to patients, if necessary.The federal indictment alleges that Fostich engaged in a scheme from Jan. 1, 2016, through Dec. 11, 2016, to fraudulently obtain fentanyl and morphine. As part of the scheme, Fostich allegedly prepared patient care records and state reporting forms that contained misrepresentations regarding his use of fentanyl and morphine.According to the indictment, Fostich reported he was responsible for the use of 806 doses of fentanyl, which accounted for approximately 39 percent of all of the KCFD’s total reported use during that period of time. Fostich also reported he was responsible for the use of 636 doses of morphine, which accounted for approximately 63 percent of all of the KCFD’s total reported use of morphine during that period of time.The federal indictment also alleges that Fostich tampered with a container of fentanyl on Dec. 11, 2016. Fostich removed fentanyl from the vials contained in a KCFD narcotics box and replaced them with another solution in the vials, the indictment says, with reckless disregard for the risk that another person would be placed in danger of death or bodily injury. Fostich allegedly placed the vials back in the narcotics box, attempted to reseal the narcotics box, and then placed the narcotics box back in a safe located on a KCFD ambulance.The charges contained in this indictment are accusations, and not evidence of guilt. Evidence supporting the charges must be presented to a federal trial jury, whose duty is to determine guilt or innocence.This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jess E. Michaelsen and Jeffrey Q. McCarther.

Showing no regard for people's safety, the defendants mixed fentanyl into hundreds of pills, including some that killed at least one person and harmed countless others. I want to thank the DEA, the FDA, our fabulous state and local partners with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, Murfreesboro Police, and the Rutherford County Sheriff's Office, as well as Department of Justice attorneys Amanda Klopf and Brent Hannafan for their hard work on this case. Their efforts have led to justice being served.\"“The jury’s verdicts in this case will now hold these individuals accountable for seeking to profit from the devastating opioid epidemic that continues to plague communities across our nation,” said U.S. Attorney Cochran.  “Long prison sentences for these individuals will soon follow.  I commend the jury for seriously shouldering their responsibility and I thank our law enforcement partners and our prosecutors for their untiring efforts in bringing justice on behalf of the people of this district”.This case began on July 6, 2016, when law enforcement and medical personnel in the Murfreesboro, Tennessee area were overwhelmed by a series of overdoses caused by pills that appeared to be prescription Percocet pills.  The pills were counterfeit and contained fentanyl, alprazolam, and acetaminophen, and had been pressed by Joedon Bradley and Eric Falkowksi.According to testimony at trial, in May 2016, Eric Falkowski moved his pill operation to Madison, Tennessee, after law enforcement conducted a search of his home in Florida and seized his pill presses.  Following the seizure, Falkowski obtained more fentanyl through the internet from China and purchased a new pill press through Amazon.com.Beginning on July 4, 2016, Joedon Bradley and Eric Falkowski mixed together a combination of inert pill binder, alprazolam (“Xanax”), acetaminophen (sold as Tylenol), and fentanyl.  Over the course of approximately 24 hours, Joedon Bradley helped press thousands of pills, using a pill mold that imprinted “A333” onto the ultimate product: a white, oblong pill that was almost identical to a prescription A333 Percocet pill.On July 5, 2016, Johnny Williams obtained approximately 300 pills through the chain of distribution.  Williams arranged to sell 150 of those pills for $1,050, to Jonathan Barrett through Jennifer Dogonski, a woman who acted as a broker.According to evidence at trial, during the period of July 5-6, 2016, Jonathan Barrett, Johnny Williams and Joedon Bradley all distributed counterfeit Percocet pills containing fentanyl, with the markings “A333,” that were produced by Falkowski and Bradley.  On July 6, 2016, Barrett learned that some individuals who had purchased the counterfeit pills had overdosed, and that one had possibly died, but he continued to distribute the counterfeit pills.Law enforcement later searched a home in Madison, Tennessee, pursuant to a federal search warrant, and found, among other things, the pill press, multiple molds used for embedding text onto pills, including a mold for “A333,” a pill grinder, fentanyl, alprazolam and other drug manufacturing equipment.  Testing later confirmed that the mold found at the house was the same mold used to make some of the pills seized from overdose victims during the investigation.The jury found that the distribution of the counterfeit pills containing fentanyl caused one individual to die and seven other persons to experience serious bodily injuries.The defendants face a mandatory minimum term of twenty years in prison, up to life and up to a $1,000,000.00 fine for each count charged when they are sentenced later this year.Five other defendants indicted in this case have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing.  They include Eric Falkowski, 36, of Kissimmee, Florida; Preston Davis, 24, of Madison, Tennessee; Davi Valles, Jr., 26, and LaKrista Knowles, 26, both of Nashville, Tennessee; and Jennifer Dogonski, 34, of Murfreesboro, Tennessee.This case was investigated by the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation; the Murfreesboro Police Department; the Rutherford County Sherriff’s Office; and the Food and Drug Administration.

Patrick.A federal grand jury returned the indictments March 28, 2018, against Yasser Saleh Ouwad, 47, of and Bilal Saleh Awad, 45, both of Houston. Luis Garcia-Oyuela, 33, a Honduran national who illegally resided in Houston is also charged for his role in Ouwad’s organization. Ouwad and Garcia-Oyuela are set for their arraignment today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Frances Stacy at 10:00 a.m. Awad is scheduled for a detention hearing at 2:00 p.m. today before Judge Stacy. The indictment remains sealed as to others charged but not as yet in custody for their roles in the organizations.Ouwad and Awad are alleged to have acted as high-level “fences” in multi-million dollar, multi-state criminal enterprises involving stolen over-the-counter (OTC) medicine, diabetic test strips and health and beauty supplies. The enterprises allegedly used “boosters” to steal OTC medication from large retailers.A “booster” allegedly steals goods and merchandise not for personal use but for re-sale to a “fence” for a fraction of its retail value. A “fence” is a person who receives stolen goods and merchandise from “boosters” and others. The “fence” then re-sells the stolen goods and merchandise to third parties for a profit.The scope of these criminal enterprises ranged from June 2015 to March 2018, according to the charges.The indictment alleges Ouwad owned and operated Houston-based GPS Wholesale Inc. which he ran from his warehouse at 12440 Oxford Park, in Houston. At his warehouse, he and Garcia-Oyuela would receive stolen OTC, clean the products of anti-theft stickers and security labels, re-package the products into pallets and ship the merchandise to wholesale companies in the New Jersey, according to the charges. The indictment further alleges he hired undocumented aliens from Central America to travel throughout the United States to steal the OTC, beauty products and diabetic test strips from major retail chain stores such as Wal-Mart, CVS and Walgreens. He allegedly facilitated this interstate travel by fronting the boosters with travel money, wiring them money during their travels and paying the boosters for the stolen merchandise.Awad allegedly ran a similar operation, but received his stolen merchandise at Cube Smart at 7001 Synott Road in Houston. The indictment alleges he cleaned and re-packaged the stolen OTC merchandise at his residence in Houston before shipping the product to a wholesale company in Oceanside, New York.To avoid detection by law enforcement, the undocumented aliens would ship the stolen merchandise to Ouwad and Awad using fictitious names and company names, according to the charges. Once the stolen merchandise arrived in Houston, Awad and Ouwad or their associates would allegedly remove any retail store identifying labels and security features. The indictment alleges the fences would then have the stolen products repackaged and shipped to wholesalers in the Northeast for profit.Authorities conducted a search of Ouwad’s warehouse on Feb. 27, 2018, at which time they seized almost $600,000 in stolen OTC as well as inventory lists and numerous items related to his alleged criminal activity. The following day, Awad was found with similar items related to his operation at his residence.Ouwad, Awad and Garcia-Oyuela each face up to five years for conspiracy to transport stolen merchandise in interstate commerce as well as up to 10 years for each count of possessing and transporting interstate stolen merchandise. All charges also include a possible $250,000 maximum fine.Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations and the Food and Drug Administration conducted the investigation with the cooperation of CVS, Walgreens, Proctor & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Roche, Abbott and Kroger. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Heather Winter and Richard Hanes are prosecuting the case.An indictment is a formal accusation of criminal conduct, not evidence.A defendant is presumed innocent unless convicted through due process of law.Component(s):USAO - Texas, Southern"

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseMarch 27, 2018United States Department of JusticeNorthern District of AlabamaBIRMINGHAM– A federal judge today sentenced the owner of a Decatur compounding pharmacy to five years in prison for conspiring to defraud a federal health insurance program out of more than $10 million. U.S. Attorney Jay E. Town, Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigation, Miami Field Office, Special Agent in Charge Justin D. Green and Defense Criminal Investigative Service Special Agent in Charge John F. Khin announced the sentence.U.S. District Judge R. David Proctor sentenced JOHN CHRISTOPHER LEMLEY, 51, of Decatur, for the health care fraud conspiracy and ordered him to forfeit nearly $1 million as proceeds of the crime. Most of that amount – $918,234 – already has been seized from bank accounts held by Lemley or his businesses, along with a 2015 Lexus Gx-460 Premium bought with criminal proceeds, according to court documents. The judge also ordered Lemley to pay $918,234 in restitution to the federal military health insurance program. Lemley pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge in November. He must report to prison June 20.“Every dollar stolen from TRICARE is a dollar that weakens our overall military posture and makes healthcare for our troops even more embattled,” Town said. “Whether $10 million or $10,000, those who intend to defraud the federal government, especially our DOD components, will be joining Mr. Lemley soon.”“This sentencing, resulting from a complex and widespread investigation by DCIS and other law enforcement partners, is a strong warning to anyone who believes they can get away with conspiring and scheming to fleece the Defense Department's TRICARE system,” Khin said. “Fraud and corruption in our health care programs, especially involving deceptive practices with prescription medications, is far from a ‘victimless’ crime. This defendant selfishly put greed and personal gain before the safety and well-being of our military members, their families, and retirees, who deserve proper medications and the best care available.”“U.S. consumers rely on the FDA to ensure they receive drugs which are safe, effective, and properly labeled,” Green said. “We remain fully committed to pursuing those individuals who endanger the public health by distributing misbranded products.”Lemley owned a Decatur pharmacy that operated as Southern Compounding. He also owned Apotheca Supply, which was licensed to relabel and repackage pharmaceutical drugs. Apotheca was located in a suite adjoining Southern Compounding on U.S. Highway 31 South. Lemley also had a 20 percent membership interest in Medworx Sunflower LLC, an affiliate of Medworx Compounding, a pharmacy in Ridgeland, Miss., according to the charges against Lemley and the government’s sentencing memorandum.Between February 2015 to January 2016, Lemley conspired with others at Medworx Sunflower and Southern Compounding to defraud TRICARE, a U.S. Department of Defense health care program, as well as third-party prescription-drug program administrator Express Scripts Incorporated, according to the court documents. Southern Compounding submitted prescription reimbursement claims to TRICARE as part of ESI’s pharmacy network.As part of the conspiracy, Lemley conducted the fraud by various means that included improperly contracting with Medworx Compounding to refer prescriptions to Southern Compounding. He also paid kickbacks to independent sales representatives as incentive to refer TRICARE prescriptions, sold misbranded over-the-counter medications as prescription drugs, and failed to reverse claims on prescriptions he knew were forged, according to court documents.Although ESI’s regulations prohibited Southern Compounding from subcontracting any of its work, Southern entered a management agreement with Medworx in early 2015 whereby Medworx referred prescriptions to Southern Compounding. Southern filled the prescriptions, billed third-party administrators for them and sent almost all the payments received to Medworx. Medworx then returned a portion of those payments directly to Lemley. The amount returned totaled $918,234, representing a distribution for Lemley’s 20 percent membership interest in the Medworx affiliate, Medworx Sunflower.Southern Compounding’s billings to TRICARE soared in the two months after Southern entered its agreement with Medworx, according to court documents. In the 13 months prior to the agreement, TRICARE paid claims of about $215,561 to Southern. In the two months following the February 2015 agreement, TRICARE, through ESI, paid about $10.5 million in claims to Southern. More than 90 percent of that was profit.In accordance with Southern’s management agreement with Medworx, Lemley transferred most of the money – about $10.2 million – to Medworx. Most of the transferred money was to fund kickbacks to the independent sales representatives, according court documents.FDA-OCI and DCIS investigated the case, which Assistant U.S. Attorney Chinelo Dike-Minor prosecuted.Component(s):USAO - Alabama, Northern"

Ltd., a Chinese firm that sells raw ingredients for use in dietary supplements. Xu pleaded guilty in August 2018 in the Northern District of Texas to one count of wire fraud. Waseta, the company, also pleaded guilty to wire fraud in September 2018. The company was sentenced in February 2019 to one year of probation and ordered to pay a $500,000 fine.In pleading guilty, Xu admitted that he agreed with others working at Waseta to sell synthetic stimulant ingredients, including the substance known as DMHA, to a purported dietary supplement manufacturer in the United States. Xu admitted that the purported dietary supplement manufacturer, actually a confidential government informant, told him that Waseta ingredients would not be accurately listed on the labels of the finished dietary supplement. Xu admitted that he knew major American retailers would refuse to carry supplements known to contain certain stimulants, such as DMHA. Xu also admitted that he and Waseta caused a falsely labeled shipment of DMHA to be sent to Texas.“Consumers are entitled to trust that dietary supplements products accurately identify their ingredients,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt for the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. “We will vigorously pursue and prosecute those who attempt to circumvent the law by falsely identifying the substances they import into the United States.”Xu and Waseta both were sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Sam A. Lindsay of the Northern District of Texas. Xu was arrested in September 2017 while attending a dietary supplement trade show in Las Vegas. Another defendant named in the case, Li Ting Ting (a.k.a.

Gorton to 130 months in prison and three years of supervised release. In November 2017, Goodwin pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, one count of conspiracy to traffic counterfeit drugs, one count of trafficking counterfeit drugs, one count of possession with intent to distribute controlled substances, and one count of money laundering conspiracy.In April 2017, Goodwin and five others, including Tyler Bauman, a/k/a “musclehead 320,” were arrested andchargedwith operating a counterfeit steroid operation on the North Shore.From approximately May 2015 until April 12, 2017, the conspirators manufactured steroid products - made from raw materials purchased overseas - in Goodwin’s home, and marketed them as “Onyx” steroids using “Onyx” labels that were also ordered from overseas suppliers. Onyx, now owned by Amgen Inc., is a legitimate pharmaceutical company that does not manufacture steroids.The defendants sold the steroids online to customers across the United States using email and social media platforms, collected payment through money remitters, such as Western Union and MoneyGram, and used false identifications and multiple remitter locations to pick up the proceeds. Some of the defendants laundered proceeds from the steroid sales through Wicked Tan LLC, a tanning business located in Beverly, which they owned and operated specifically to launder the proceeds of the steroid operation.In August 2017, Bauman pleaded guilty to his role in the conspiracy and was sentenced in March 2018 to 10 years in prison.United States Attorney Andrew E.

Grinstead, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Kansas City Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who jeopardize the public health.”Michael S. Schindele, 44, of Jacksonville, Fla., was sentenced by U.S. Chief District Judge Beth Phillips to three years and one month in federal prison without parole. The court also ordered Schindele to forfeit $47,930, which represents his profit from the scheme.On Aug. 15, 2018, Schindele pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and one count of delivering adulterated or misbranded food. Schindele, the owner and operator of Executive Image International, operated a website that sold dietary supplements and drugs to the general public. He worked through businesses owned and operated by co-defendants John G. Schindele, 42 (his brother), and Jennifer S. Travis, 46, both of Nixa, to sell dietary supplements, which they claimed contained only all-natural ingredients. John Schindele and Travis both pleaded guilty, in separate but related cases, and were each sentenced to five years of probation.Among the many supplements sold by Michael Schindele was Silver Bullet, marketed as an “all-natural male performance enhancer,” an “Extreme Male Stimulant,” and a “dietary supplement.” In reality, Silver Bullet contained materially different ingredients than what was listed, including sildenafil, a synthetic pharmaceutical ingredient that was not disclosed to consumers purchasing the product.Sildenafil is the active pharmaceutical that is commonly used in the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra. The labeling for Silver Bullet failed to provide adequate warnings about the use of a sildenafil-containing product, which is only legally available with a prescription from a doctor. Michael Schindele was not authorized or licensed to sell this pharmaceutical.Michael Schindele’s misrepresentations resulted in him, Executive Image International, Schindele Enterprises, and Midwest Wholesale obtaining at least $150,000 from consumers.  Michael Schindele, personally, received at least $47,930, which must be forfeited to the government.Michael Schindele directed the purchase of sildenafil from a supplier in the People’s Republic of China. He directed hundreds, if not thousands, of mass mailings of misleading and fraudulent advertisements claiming the product was “all natural,” which included samples of the tainted products. He coordinated the sale of the tainted products through his brother, John Schindele, and Travis over several years. Michael Schindele also directed his brother to use the proceeds from these fraudulent sales to pay for his personal expenses and transfer the cash in order to conceal his involvement in the fraud.After he moved to Jacksonville, according to court documents, Michael Schindele started another business to perpetrate the same criminal fraud. He hired another person in the state of Georgia to handle the mailings and distribution of the illegal product. The new operation fraudulently sold dangerous misbranded food products that contained sildenafil and tadalafil at higher than normal levels that a reasonable physician would initially prescribe. In fact, there is not a combination pill currently approved by the FDA that contains both drugs, as they are created by different manufacturers.During the time of the fraud scheme, which operated from Oct. 11, 2011, through Jan. 6, 2014, Michael Schindele also pleaded guilty in a separate and unrelated case to the misdemeanor offense of introducing an unapproved animal drug. Schindele admitted that he sold heartworm tablets that were produced in Australia and had not been approved for sale in the United States, and which required a veterinarian’s prescription. Federal agents seized 1,368 doses of the heartworm tablets from Michael Schindele’s EZBody store in Springfield. Michael Schindele was sentenced for that offense on July 17, 2012, to one year of unsupervised probation.According to court documents, Michael Schindele recruited his brother and Travis to become the face of the operation after he became aware of the government’s investigation into this earlier criminal enterprise.According to his plea agreement, John Schindele fraudulently received $210,000 for the misrepresented and mislabeled dietary supplements from April 16, 2012, to July 8, 2015. According to her plea agreement, Travis fraudulently received $152,862 for the misrepresented and mislabeled dietary supplements from June 2, 2014, through Jan. 31, 2017.These cases were prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nhan D. Nguyen and Patrick Carney. They were investigated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI).Topic(s):Consumer ProtectionComponent(s):USAO - Missouri, Western"

Cyril Willson, 38, of Ralston, Nebraska, and Matthew Hebert, 40, of Dallas, pleaded guilty today to introducing misbranded food into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud or mislead. Jonathan Doyle, 40, of Dallas, the president of USPlabs, pleaded guilty February 21 to conspiracy to introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce. Sitesh Patel, 35, of Irvine, California, the vice president of S.K. Laboratories, a California dietary supplement manufacturer, pleaded guilty on February 25 to conspiracy to introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce and to the introduction of misbranded food into interstate commerce. Jacobo Geissler, 42, of University Park, Texas, the CEO of USPlabs, pleaded guilty on February 28 to conspiracy to introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce. In addition, S.K. Laboratories pleaded guilty on February 25 to introduction of misbranded food into interstate commerce, and USPlabs pleaded guilty to conspiracy to introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce on March 5.The misbranding charges all relate in part to OxyElite Pro, which was recalled in 2013 in the wake of an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration into whether the supplement caused liver injuries in consumers. All of the defendants were charged in a 2015 indictment returned by a Dallas federal grand jury in the Northern District of Texas.“Dietary supplement makers may not disregard the law and trick consumers about what is in their products,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. “Consumers are entitled to trust that the products they consume are safe. We will continue to investigate and prosecute those who enable the sale of mislabeled and potentially unsafe dietary supplements.”The indictment alleged that the defendants participated in a conspiracy to import dietary supplement ingredients from China, including the stimulant known as “DMAA,” using false certificates of analysis and false labeling, and then lied about the source and nature of those ingredients. According to the indictment, the defendants told some of their retailers and wholesalers that USPlabs products contained natural plant extracts, when in fact they contained a synthetic stimulant manufactured in a Chinese chemical factory. The indictment also alleged that the defendants sold some of their products without determining whether they would be safe to use. According to the indictment, USPlabs products related to the conspiracy brought the company hundreds of millions of dollars.In pleading guilty, Doyle, Geissler, and Patel admitted that they imported substances with false and misleading labeling in part to avoid law enforcement and regulatory agency attention. Willson and Hebert admitted that they helped to cause a dietary supplement to be shipped with false labeling regarding the ingredients it contained.“Consumers deserve to know exactly what’s in their dietary supplements,” said U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas Erin Nealy Cox. “We cannot stand by as supplement companies deceive customers – especially when they use untested, suspect ingredients in their products.”“Americans who choose to take dietary supplements expect that those products are safe and properly labeled,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “Dietary supplement labeling that falsely or misleadingly declares its contents presents a risk to the public, and the FDA will exercise its full authority under the law to bring to justice all those who produce and distribute misbranded dietary supplements.”Doyle and Geissler pleaded guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge Renee Harris Toliver. Patel, Willson, Hebert, S.K. Laboratories, and USPlabs pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Sam A. Lindsay. Patel faces a maximum sentence of six years’ imprisonment; Doyle and Geissler face up to five years’ imprisonment; and Willson and Hebert face up to three years’ imprisonment. The individual defendants, together with the companies, agreed to pay criminal fines and forfeitures totaling about $60 million. The court set sentencing hearings for Willson and Hebert on July 8, 2019, for Patel and S.K. Laboratories on Aug. 12, 2019, and for USPlabs on Aug. 19, 2019.  The remaining sentencing dates have not yet been set.The case was investigated by FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations.

Subsys is a powerful, fentanyl-based pain medication intended to treat cancer patients suffering intense breakthrough pain.One method employed by Burlakoff and his alleged co-conspirators was the Insys Speaker Program (ISP), which was used as a vehicle to bribe doctors and other clinicians to prescribe Subsys to their patients. Insys sales representatives targeted and promised medical professionals the opportunity to be paid Insys speakers if they wrote prescriptions for Subsys. The more prescriptions written for Subsys – and the higher the dose – the more speaking opportunities were awarded and more fee paid to the clinicians. However, the speaking opportunities were merely an excuse for the clinician and friends to have a meal and drinks paid for by Insys, and for the speaker to be paid. As a result, insurers were defrauded by paying reimbursements for Subsys, a more expensive drug than its nearest competitor, and often prescribed when medically unnecessary and inappropriate.Other methods were also used to bribe and induce medical professionals to prescribe Subsys. For example, employees of the practitioner’s office were moved onto the Insys payroll. Additionally, relatives and girlfriends of the medical professionals who were high volume writers were also hired.As a result of the conspiracy, many patients were inappropriately prescribed and overprescribed Subsys, which is highly addictive and dangerous.The charge of RICO conspiracy provides for a sentence of no greater than 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000, or twice the amount of pecuniary gain or loss. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.United States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling; Harold H.

Casey, 74, of Poquoson, is the owner and President of Casey’s Seafood, Inc. According to court documents, from at least July 2012 through June 2015, Casey knowingly conspired to replace Atlantic blue crab with crab meat from Indonesia, China, Thailand, Vietnam, and Central and South America. Casey and his co-conspirators falsely labeled at least 397,917 pounds of crab meat, with a retail value in the millions of dollars, as Atlantic blue crab and “Product of the United States”.According to court documents, Casey directed employees to remove foreign crabmeat from the original shipper’s packaging containers, blend and combine foreign crab meat from one processor with crab meat from another processor, and place it into different packing containers with a label declaring that the contents were a “Product of USA,” despite knowing that the contents were imported crab meat.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseOctober 18, 2018United States Department of JusticeDistrict of UtahSALT LAKE CITY – A federal grand jury in Salt Lake City returned a second superseding indictment Thursday morning in the Aaron Michael Shamo case.  The 13-count indictment alleges a count of aiding and abetting the distribution of a controlled substance (fentanyl) resulting in death.The indictment alleges that Shamo intentionally and knowingly distributed a substance containing Fentanyl, the use of which resulted in the June 13, 2016, death of a person identified as R.K. in the indictment.The superseding indictment charges one count of Continuing Criminal Enterprise; three counts of aiding and abetting the importation of a controlled substance; one count of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, one count of manufacture of a controlled substance and two counts of knowing and intentional adulteration of drugs while held for sale.  It also includes one count of aiding and abetting the use of the U.S. mail in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense, one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, one count of money laundering promotion and concealment, and one count of engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activities – in addition to the distribution resulting in death count.The indictment alleges Shamo directed an international drug trafficking organization that imported Fentanyl and Alprazolam from China and manufactured controlled substances, namely fake oxycodone pills made with Fentanyl and counterfeit Xanax tablets. Documents filed by federal prosecutors as a part of the case allege Shamo and his co-conspirators purchased pill tableting machines – sometimes called pill presses – to mark pills so the markings would match those of legitimate pharmaceutical drugs.  The organization distributed these controlled substances to other individuals for distribution throughout the United States and elsewhere using their storefront, PHARMA-MASTER, on the Dark Net marketplace AlphaBay and through the U.S. mail, according to the indictment and case documents.  According to a complaint filed in the case, when law enforcement officers executed a search warrant at Shamo’s house in November 2016, they found approximately 70,000 pills that had the appearance of Oxycodone and more than 25,000 pills that appeared to be Alprazolam. The drug trafficking organization distributed more than 800,000 pills.Counts 8 and 9 of the indictment allege Shamo manufactured round blue tablets with markings on them to look like Oxycodone tablets.  He offered the tablets for sale on the internet as Oxycodone 30 mg tablets.  Despite these representations, the defendant did not use Oxycodone in the manufacturing process. He substituted Fentanyl, a much more potent synthetic opioid, the indictment alleges.The organization began as a collaboration between Shamo and Drew Wilson Crandall, but grew to include others.Crandall, age 32, most recently of Brisbane, Australia, pleaded guilty in federal court Wednesday to conspiracy to distribute Fentanyl, conspiracy to distribute Alprazolam, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.  As a part of a statement in advance of the plea agreement filed in court, Crandall admitted that he and his co-defendant, Shamo, imported and distributed controlled substances in Utah and elsewhere.  He admitted they sold controlled substances on dark web marketplaces.  As he made plans to leave the country, he trained co-conspirators to assume the roles he had held in the organization. He admitted he stayed in contact with Shamo after leaving Utah and began to provide online customer support for Shamo’s vendor account on AlphaBay. This work continued until Shamo’s arrest in November 2016.Crandall admitted that the co-conspirators each had a role to play and they relied on each other to meet their common objective: to earn money by selling drugs.According to the plea agreement, Shamo normally paid Crandall by bitcoin while he was out of the country.  However, at his request in November 2016, Shamo deposited drug proceeds – specifically U.S. currency – into Crandall’s bank account as payment for his ongoing services to PHARMA-MASTER.Federal prosecutors have agreed to recommend Crandall be sentenced at the low end of the sentencing guideline range determined by the Court.  He faces up to life in prison with a mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison for the conspiracy to distribute fentanyl conviction, up to five years for the for conspiracy to distribute alprazolam, and a maximum of 20 years for conspiracy to commit money laundering.Other defendants charged in earlier indictments have also reached plea agreements in the case. They include Alexandrya Marie Tonge, age 26, and Katherine Lauren Anne Bustin, age 28, both of South Jordan, Utah; and Mario Anthony Noble, age 29, and Sean Michael Gygi, age 28, both of Midvale, Utah. Sentencings for these defendants will be scheduled at a later date.Shamo faces a mandatory life sentence if convicted of the Continuing Criminal Enterprise count in the indictment.  Several other counts, including aiding and abetting the importation of fentanyl, possession of fentanyl with intent to distribute and aiding and abetting the distribution of a controlled substance resulting in death carry potential life sentences.  Other counts carry potential sentences of five years to 40 years.The indictment includes a notice that federal prosecutors intend to seek criminal forfeiture of property and proceeds derived from the alleged conduct or used to commit or facilitate the commission of the offenses.  Included in the notice is millions of dollars in U.S. currency, an industrial large pill press and associated dyes, four 100-ounce silver bars, and cash as a substitute for two vehicles sold as a part of the case – among other things.Indictments are not findings of guilt.  An individual charged in an indictment is presumed innocent unless or until proven guilty in court.A three-week trial is set to start on Jan. 22, 2019, before U.S. District Judge Dale A. Kimball.Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys from the Utah Attorney General’s Office are joining an Assistant United States Attorney in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Salt Lake City in prosecuting the case.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseNovember 29, 2018United States Department of JusticeCentral District of CaliforniaLOS ANGELES– Two Southern California residents were arrested Wednesday in connection with a long-running scheme to smuggle purported dietary supplement ingredients into the United States from China, the Department of Justice announced today.Lynn Chau, 43, of Rosemead, and Bao Luu, 42, of Mira Loma, were charged in a seven-count indictment that was returned by a Los Angeles federal grand jury on November 7, and unsealed today. The indictment also charged Pure Assay Ingredients Inc., Chau’s import company located in City of Industry, and two Chinese citizens, Alex Wang and Ivy He, who worked for Pure Assay in Chengdu, China.According to the indictment, the defendants conspired to deceive the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CPB) inspectors by mislabeling certain stimulants and other questionable ingredients as non-controversial substances to evade government scrutiny during import. The indictment alleges that the defendants sold the smuggled substances to dietary supplement manufacturers in the United States for use in consumer products. In one instance, the indictment contends that Chau and Luu assembled a false shipment to fool FDA into believing that Pure Assay destroyed substances the agency blocked from distribution. In reality, Pure Assay already had shipped out the real products and presented mislabeled substitutes for destruction.“The public deserves honesty and integrity from companies importing ingredients for the products people purchase and consume,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt for the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. “We will continue to pursue and prosecute those who import dangerous and illegal ingredients for fraudulent purposes.”“This case alleges a scheme designed to generate profits at the expense of the public’s health and safety,” said United States Attorney Nick Hanna. “Members of the conspiracy are charged with smuggling prohibited substances, such as steroid precursors, and attempting to prevent U.S. officials from learning the true nature of the shipments that made their way into so-called dietary supplements. We will continue to investigate and prosecute people involved in deceptive practices that endanger consumers.”According to the indictment, Pure Assay, Chau, Wang and He prepared fraudulent documents, including false certificates of analysis and false labels, and submitted them to FDA when they believed that an ingredient would be denied entry or invite inquiries from FDA and CPB. The false documents typically declared the substances to be sucralose, melatonin, or other legal ingredients. The indictment alleges that the defendants used this method to smuggle into the United States designer steroids and stimulants for use in dietary supplements while disregarding the risk that their operation posed to consumers.“American consumers are put at risk when the true nature of ingredients for dietary supplements is hidden from regulatory authorities,” said Charles L. Grinstead, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Kansas City Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who jeopardize the public health.”The indictment against Pure Assay and its principals follows a separate, recent prosecution against several Chinese citizens charged with conspiring to mislabel synthetic dietary supplement ingredients or otherwise helping to hide the true nature of a purported new dietary supplement from American retailers. Three Chinese nationals arrested in Las Vegas last fall while attending a dietary supplement trade show later pleaded guilty in connection with that prosecution.The case was investigated by FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations. The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Patrick Runkle, Raquel Toledo, and David Sullivan of the Department of Justice’s Consumer Protection Branch, and Erik Silber, Assistant United States Attorney for the Central District of California.An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed.

(MII) (collectively, “ABC” or “the Company”), entered into a settlement with the United States in which it agreed to pay $625 million to resolve civil liability under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3730et seq.The claims against ABC arise from its repackaging and distributing of Pre-Filled Syringes (PFS) that were not approved for sale or use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The drugs involved in the scheme were Procrit®, Aloxi®, Kytril® and its generic form granisetron, Anzemet® and Neupogen®, all supportive drugs for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment (the PFS Drugs).As part of the civil settlement, ABC admitted that between January 2001 and January 2014, MII and OSC operated a program that created, packed and shipped millions of PFS to oncology practices for administration to vulnerable cancer patients (the PFS Program).  At MII, an ABC subsidiary located in Alabama, the drug product was removed from the original glass vials and multiple vials of the product were pooled in untested plastic containers.  Then the drug, including the overfill[1], was extracted and repackaged into syringes.  By harvesting the overfill, ABC was able to create more doses than it bought from the original vial manufacturers and avoid opening some of the vials.  ABC retained the unopened vials and sold them to other customers and to its subsidiary ABDC for resale.  During the 13 years the PFS Program was in operation, MII manufactured thousands of syringes daily, and eventually over one million syringes per year.  These syringes were sold throughout the United States.  Approximately 57% of the patients who were injected with the PFS were Federal Health Care Program beneficiaries.  The profit from the PFS Program was between $2.3 and $14.4 million annually for a total profit of at least $99.6 million.ABC’s scheme enabled it to bill multiple health care providers for the same vial of drug, causing some of those providers to bill the Federal Health Care Programs for the same vial more than once.  The scheme also enabled ABC to increase its market share by offering various product discounts, which it leveraged to obtain new customers and to keep existing customers who purchased its entire portfolio of oncology drugs.  ABC excluded the entire PFS Program from its standard regulatory audit and pedigree compliance programs.This civil settlement brings to $885 million the total penalties that ABC has paid to resolve liability resulting from the PFS Program.  Previously, in September 2017, ABSG pleaded guilty to a criminal violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 33l(a) and 333(a)(l) for the introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce, as such drugs were manufactured and prepared at MII, an establishment not registered with the FDA pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 360.  In connection with that guilty plea, ABSG paid $260 million in criminal fines and forfeiture.Richard P. Donoghue, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York; Joseph H. Hunt,Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division of the Department of Justice; Mark S.

Mastronardi, Special Agent-in-Charge, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Office of the Inspector General (OPM-OIG); and Leigh-Alistair Barzey, Special Agent-in-Charge, Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), Northeast Field Office, announced the settlement.“ABC placed corporate profits over patients’ needs, endangering the health of vulnerable cancer patients,” stated United States Attorney Donoghue.  “This settlement, and the substantial penalty ABC has agreed to pay, reflect this Office’s firm commitment to protecting those in need of healthcare and holding to account those who put the health and safety of patients at risk.”  Mr. Donoghue also expressed his appreciation to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units for their assistance.“The $885 million combined civil and criminal resolution with ABC underscores our determination to utilize all tools at our disposal to pursue illicit schemes that seek to profit from circumvention of important safeguards designed to protect the nation’s drug supply,” said Assistant Attorney General Hunt.  “We will continue to be particularly vigilant where these schemes put the health and safety of vulnerable patients at risk.”“U.S. patients rely on the FDA to ensure that injectable chemotherapy drugs are safe and effective. When companies attempt to avoid FDA’s oversight authority, they endanger these vulnerable patients’ health,” stated FDA-OCI Special Agent-in-Charge McCormack. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who violate the public’s trust.”“Drug companies such as ABC that seek to boost profits at the expense of cancer patients unnecessarily put the health and safety of this vulnerable population at risk,” stated HHS-OIG Special Agent-in-Charge Lampert.  “Greed must never be a part of medical decision making.  HHS-OIG, along with our law enforcement partners, is committed to protecting patient quality of care, and this settlement should serve as a warning to drug companies that are tempted to shortchange patient well-being.”“Ensuring that Federal employees, retirees, and their families are protected from the adulteration of drugs and other harmful practices is of the utmost importance to the OPM-OIG,” stated OPM-OIG Special-Agent-in-Charge Mastronardi.  “We will continue to aggressively investigate and prosecute all individuals who pursue profit at the expense of patient safety.  I’d like to thank our criminal investigators and their law enforcement partners for their hard work and dedication on this case.”“Ensuring the integrity of TRICARE, the U.S. Department of Defense's health care plan, is of paramount importance to the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS),” stated DCIS Special Agent-in-Charge Barzey.  “Today’s settlement is the result of a joint agency effort to investigate pharmaceutical companies that manufacture and sell adulterated drugs that could threaten U.S. military members, retirees and their dependents.”In its investigation, the United States determined that for each of the drugs that were converted into PFS, ABC failed to submit a New Drug Application or a Biologics License Application demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the PFS and did not receive FDA approval to manufacture the PFS.  For this reason, the PFS, distributed throughout the United States for 13 years, were unapproved new drugs.  In addition, ABC did not register MII with the FDA as a repackager.  By avoiding registration, ABC also evaded FDA inspection and important safety and sterility safeguards, including current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”), required of repackagers to ensure that their drug products are safe and effective.  The United States contends that ABC was aware of the requirements to register, submit to inspection and prepare drugs in accordance with cGMP, but chose not to comply.  Instead, the government’s investigation revealed that ABC falsely represented to physician customers that MII was a pharmacy.  Through this claim, ABC sought to avoid FDA regulations because certain pharmacy practices are regulated under applicable state pharmacy laws.  However, MII did not comport itself as a pharmacy.  For example, MII did not obtain valid prescriptions, check for harmful potential drug interactions, or see or counsel patients.  As ABC admitted, on many occasions, MII assigned the name of an individual to a set of PFS, and OSC subsequently shipped PFS that were in a bag labeled with that individual’s name, despite the fact that the individual was not in fact a patient who was to be administered a PFS. In some instances, the individual's name assigned to the set of PFS was a staff member at a physician customer (such as a nurse or office manager); in others, the individual was no longer a patient of the physician customer, either because the individual was no longer receiving treatment and/or because the individual was deceased.  In addition, MII often filled orders that had been submitted with a single patient name, and/or assigned a single individual’s name to an order of PFS, far in excess of plausible and/or safe use of the drug product contained in the syringes.  In addition, the United States contends that ABC represented to physicians that its repackaging procedures followed aseptic technique and complied with all applicable laws.  The United States determined that the PFS were prepared in an unclean environment, were contaminated with actual filth, and were not of the quality or purity that ABC represented.The settlement also resolves allegations that ABC gave kickbacks to physicians to induce them to purchase drugs through the PFS program.  The alleged kickbacks were in the form of general pharmacy credits provided to the customer, which were not identifiable on an invoice as specific to Procrit®.  OSC billed customers for Procrit® at full price and at the end of the week or month added a “general credit” to the customers’ account.  Credits were not given for other drugs.  The pharmacy rebate was not listed on the invoice as related to Procrit®; it was listed as a pharmacy rebate for pharmacy sales.With the exception of the facts contained in the Statement of Facts attached to the settlement agreement, the settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing by ABC.The settlement is the culmination of a multi-year parallel civil and criminal investigation by this Office into allegations contained in threequi tamactions filed against ABC in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.[2]On August 31, 2017, the United States intervened in those actions, which were unsealed today.  The cases areU.S. ex rel Michael Mullen v. AmerisourceBergen, et al.No. 1:10-4856;U.S. ex rel Omni Healthcare Inc. v. AmerisourceBergen, et al.No. 12-CV-1178; andU.S. ex rel Daniel Sypula, RPH and Kelly Hodge v. AmerisourceBergen, et al.,No. 1:14-5278.  All of the cases are pending before the Honorable Nina Gershon.  The criminal case was resolved through a plea agreement in September 2017.United States v. AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group, LLC,CR. No. 17-507 (NG).  In connection with the settlement, ABC also entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (“HHS-OIG”).  In addition, ABC and 43 States have an agreement in principle to resolve claims under the States’ false claims acts.The civil investigation and settlement with ABC were handled by the Office’s Civil Division.  Assistant United States Attorneys Deborah B. Zwany and Matthew Silverman are in charge of these cases and were assisted by former Affirmative Civil Enforcement Coordinator Emily Rosenthal.  The Office of Criminal Investigation at FDA, the Offices of the Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Defense, the Office of Personnel Management and the Department of Veterans Affairs assisted in the investigation of these cases.  Sanjay Bhambhani, Department of Justice, Civil Frauds Section, and Jay Speers and Elizabeth Silverman, New York State Medicaid Fraud Control Unit assisted in the settlement of these cases.  The criminal case against ABC was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Alixandra E. Smith and Ameet B. Kabrawala of the Office’s Business and Securities Fraud Section.[1]The term “overfill” is a frequently used term in the pharmaceutical industry generally meaning the amount of extra drug above and beyond the labeled dose that is contained in an FDA-approved vial of drug.  The overfill is not listed on the FDA-approved drug label.  The reason manufacturers put overfill in each vial of drug is to ensure that the health care provider administering the drug will be able to extract the full labeled dose from the vial to give to the patient.See, e.g., 75 Fed. Reg. 73170, 73466-67 (Nov 29, 2010).  It is also not included in the price of the vial.[2]United States ex rel. Daniel Sypula v.

Prescriptions for varying amounts of Oxycodone pills were written and presented to pharmacies by other members of the conspiracy and individuals working at the direction of the conspirators. The scheme often times included the fraudulent use of medical insurance to pay pharmacies for the illicit prescriptions. Most of the Oxycodone pills gained with the use of fraudulent prescriptions were sold to others for distribution.At the time of his guilty plea, Rose admitted that as the leader of the conspiracy, he paid for individuals’ identities, health care insurance information, and medical practitioners’ names and DEA numbers. Rose provided that information to others who participated in the conspiracy, along with special paper necessary to produce the fraudulent prescriptions.Rose pleaded guilty on June 1, 2018, to conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute Oxycodone, and aggravated identity theft. He admitted to running the conspiracy for several months while incarcerated at the Adult Correctional Institution on an unrelated matter.At sentencing, U.S. District Court Chief Judge William E. Smith sentenced Rose to 72 months in federal prison to be followed by 5 years supervised release.The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines range of imprisonment in this matter is 210 months to 240 months, plus a consecutive term of 24 months incarceration on the charge of aggravated identity theft.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseNovember 29, 2018United States Department of JusticeSouthern District of West VirginiaCHARLESTON, W.Va. – United States Attorney Mike Stuart announced that two practitioners were sentenced today by United States District Court Judge Irene Berger for drug crimes in connection with the HOPE Clinic.  Stuart praised the investigation conducted by the United States Food and Drug Administration – Office of Criminal Investigations, the United States Department of Health and Human Services - Office of Inspector General, Internal Revenue Service – Criminal Investigations, the West Virginia State Police, the Kentucky State Police, the Kentucky Board of Pharmacy, Appalachia HIDTA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Drug Enforcement Administration.“Healthcare professionals that contribute to the drug epidemic, must be held accountable,” said United States Attorney Mike Stuart.  “Again, a drug dealer is a drug dealer, whether they are a street dealer, cartel leader or they wear a lab coat.”Karl O’Dell, 62, a pharmacist and former owner of Boyd County Pharmacy in Ashland, Kentucky, was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment for a conspiracy to misbrand oxycodone and hydrocodone. O’Dell was also ordered to pay a $5,000 fine and serve one year of supervised release following his term of imprisonment during which he is prohibited from working as a pharmacist. O’Dell also agreed to a civil settlement with the United States for the total gross proceeds he earned as a result of the conspiracy for $42,054.45.O’Dell admitted that he conspired to misbrand oxycodone and hydrocodone and introduce them into interstate commerce when he manufactured compounded oxycodone and hydrocodone not for medically legitimate purposes and outside the course of professional practice for customers of HOPE Clinic in anticipation of prescriptions written by HOPE Clinic practitioners. O’Dell admitted that in furtherance of the conspiracy, on two separate occasions, once in July 2014 and once in August 2014, he received prescriptions for two different customers of HOPE Clinic written by two different practitioners at HOPE Clinic each for 120 oxycodone 32 mg compounded capsules and that he dispensed the capsules to the customers knowing that there was no medically legitimate need for the compounded prescriptions.In imposing the O’Dell’s sentence, Judge Berger stated that O’Dell’s “creative conspiracy” with the HOPE Clinic and his conduct made it possible for HOPE Clinic to continue to operate “like a pill mill” while other pharmacies were refusing to fill HOPE Clinic prescriptions and that O’Dell was an “integral link” in the conspiracy. The Court further noted that during O’Dell’s twenty-month participation in the conspiracy, at no point did his conscience or his oath stop him from participating but instead, he compounded to evade oversight and in doing so his conduct was more like a drug-trafficker.Assistant United States Attorney Monica D. Coleman handled the prosecution of O’Dell.Teresa Emerson, 59, of Bristol, Virginia, was sentenced to three years of probation for aiding and abetting obtaining a controlled substance by fraud.  Emerson was also order to complete 100 hours of community service. Emmerson further agreed to surrender her DEA registration as part of her plea agreement with the United States.Emerson worked as a licensed family nurse practitioner at the HOPE Clinic in Wytheville, Virginia, where she was authorized to write prescriptions for controlled substances for legitimate medical purposes in the usual course of professional practice. Emerson admitted that on February 4, 2015, while working at the clinic, she signed a prescription for 145 oxycodone compound 32 mg to patient J.W. that was not for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual course of professional medical practice. Emerson admitted that she simply signed the prescription for what J.W. had previously been prescribed despite the fact that J.W. had at least three abnormal drug screens including testing positive for drugs she had not been prescribed and testing negative for drugs that she was prescribed.  Emerson further admitted that J.W.’s chart reflected that she had admitted to getting drugs off the street and during one of her visits, a staff member noted “track marks on her right arm.” During the plea hearing, Emerson admitted that despite these “red flags” she did not discuss the possibility of addiction with J.W. and that J.W.’s medical records did not support the initial prescription for pain medicine or any of the subsequent prescriptions for pain medicine. After receiving the prescription provided to her by Emerson on February 4, 2015, Emerson admitted that J.W. filled the prescription for the oxycodone at a pharmacy in Gilbert, Mingo County, West Virginia. J.W. has since admitted to being an addict and seeking the pills from HOPE Clinic for the purpose of feeding her addiction.In imposing the sentence, the Court noted that as a nurse practitioner, Emerson prescribed oxycodone and other controlled substances under a supervising physician. The Court further noted that while there were no legal victims to the crime, there were victims in that HOPE Clinic and Ms. Emerson, through working there, put opioids on the street, fed people’s addictions, and that patients coming to HOPE Clinic were not receiving legitimate medical care.Assistant United States Attorneys Monica D. Coleman and Steven I. Loew handled the prosecution of Emerson.###Topic(s):OpioidsComponent(s):USAO - West Virginia, Southern"

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseDecember 4, 2018United States Department of JusticeDistrict of MassachusettsBOSTON – The U.S. Attorney’s office announced today that Minnesota-based medical device manufacturer ev3 Inc. (ev3), has agreed to plead guilty to charges related to the distribution of its neurovascular medical device, Onyx Liquid Embolic System, and pay $17.9 million in fines and forfeiture.“ev3 disregarded laws designed to protect patient safety,” said United States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office is committed to protecting patients and the integrity of federal health care programs, and we will continue to use our criminal authority to ensure that medical device manufacturers play by the rules that protect the public and ensure quality of care.”“The Department of Justice will hold corporations accountable when they violate laws designed to protect consumers and protect public funds,” said Assistant Attorney General Joseph H. Hunt, of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. “This resolution demonstrates the Department’s continued commitment to protect taxpayer dollars and deter companies from putting profits before patient safety.”“Consumers rely on the FDA to ensure that there’s a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the approved uses of medical devices. When manufacturers ignore the FDA’s regulatory authority, they undermine these crucial assurances and put lives at risk. Our Office of Criminal Investigations investigated a bad actor who marketed their device for unapproved uses, potentially harming patients,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “The ev3 agreement to plead guilty announced by the U.S. Department of Justice today is an example of the FDA’s comprehensive commitment to ensuring the safety of medical devices and investigating companies that put patients at risk. A key part of our overall efforts to promote safe and effective innovation and protect patients is our enforcement work related to unsafe practices and bad actors. In addition to investigating such activities, we’re advancing other new policies to assure post-market device safety, as we recently outlined in our Medical Device Safety Action Plan. The FDA is also committed to fully implementing a new active surveillance system that will enable the agency to harness real-world evidence from medical records and patient registries to more swiftly identify device safety issues and enable more informed decision-making.”Pursuant to a criminal information filed in federal court in Boston today, the United States charged ev3 with violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. As part of the criminal resolution, ev3 has agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor offense, to pay a criminal fine of $11.9 million, and to forfeit $6 million.According to court documents, Onyx was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a liquid embolization device that is surgically injected into blood vessels to block blood flow to arteriovenous malformations in the brain. The FDA has approved Onyx only for use inside the brain. Despite the FDA’s limited approval of Onyx, from 2005 to 2009, ev3 sales representatives encouraged surgeons to use Onyx in large quantities for unproven and potentially dangerous surgical uses outside the brain. The company’s sales force continued to tout unapproved and potentially dangerous uses of Onyx even after FDA officials told ev3 executives in 2008 that they had specific safety concerns regarding uses of Onyx outside the brain. FDA officials told ev3 executives that a study would be required to gain approval for uses of Onyx outside the brain and to ensure that the benefits of the device outweighed the risks.Rather than conduct a study to ensure the safety and effectiveness of Onyx for uses outside the brain, ev3’s sales representatives attended surgical procedures and provided explicit instructions to surgeons regarding how to use Onyx for unapproved surgical procedures outside the brain, including in greater quantities than would be used in the brain. According to the criminal information, ev3’s management also set up a system of sales quotas and bonuses that incentivized sales representatives to sell Onyx for unapproved uses and trained the sales force to instruct physicians on unapproved uses of the device.“The American people, as both taxpayers and consumers, expect medical device manufacturers like EV3 to abide by relevant laws and regulations,” stated HHS-OIG Special Agent in Charge Phillip Coyne. “When medical device companies take shortcuts in order to boost profits, it erodes public confidence in the health care system, compromises patient safety, and wastes taxpayer funds intended for healthcare programs that help the most vulnerable members of society. We will continue to investigate allegations of fraud in close cooperation with our law enforcement partners.”“This sends a clear message that VA OIG and our federal partners will vigorously investigate healthcare fraud and hold companies accountable,” said Sean J. Smith, Special Agent in Charge of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Inspector General, Criminal Investigations Division, Northeast Field Office.“Incentivizing employees to promote surgical devices outside approved protocols violates FDA regulations, places patients at risk, and are unacceptable business practices.  In this case, ev3 ignored serious patient safety concerns when it gave sales representatives the green light to promote its device for unapproved uses. Today’s plea and settlement demonstrate the FBI’s commitment to holding companies accountable who violate regulations solely intended to protect the public,” said Harold H. Shaw, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Boston Division. “The FBI’s Health Care Fraud program will continue to investigate companies like ev3 that promote dangerous sales tactics that pose unacceptable risk to patient safety.”ev3 was acquired by Covidien LP in 2010, subsequent to the course of criminal conduct covered by the plea agreement. Covidien was then acquired by Medtronic in 2015. Although Medtronic played no role in the criminal conduct, the company has agreed to implement new compensation structures to ensure the sales force responsible for marketing Onyx is not incentivized to sell the device for unapproved uses. Medtronic has also agreed to conduct compliance monitoring related to Onyx sales and marketing.U.S. Attorney Lelling, Assistant Attorney General Hunt, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb, HHS-OIG SAC Coyne, VA-OIG SAC Smith, and FBI Boston SAC Shaw made the announcement today. This matter was handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Gregg Shapiro, Chief of Lelling’s Affirmative Civil Enforcement Unit, Nathaniel Yeager, Chief of Lelling’s Health Care Fraud Unit, and Christopher Looney of Lelling’s Health Care Fraud Unit, and Trial Attorney Matthew Lash of the Justice Department’s Consumer Protection Branch.Topic(s):Health Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - Massachusetts"

Kennedy, Jr. announced today that Samuel McFarland, 55, of Rochester, NY, pleaded guilty to two counts of smuggling goods into the United States before U.S. District Judge David G. Larimer. The charges each carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.Assistant U.S. Attorney Sean C. Eldridge, who is handling the case, stated that on April 10, 2017, Customs and Border Protection officers at the John F. Kennedy International Airport intercepted a package coming from Hong Kong that was addressed to the defendant. The package contained 3,012 counterfeit Viagra pills and 190 counterfeit Cialis pills. The pills were determined to be counterfeit.On January 8, 2018, CBP officers at the Rochester International Airport intercepted a package coming from China that was also addressed to McFarland’s residence. That package contained 100 bottles which included 30 counterfeit Cialis pills in each. The manifest for the package of 3000 counterfeit pills falsely listed the contents as “free trade sample” and claimed the package contained 50 plastic bottles valued at $1.00 each.On January 25, 2018, Homeland Security Investigations conducted a controlled delivery at the defendant’s residence of the package intercepted on January 8, 2018. McFarland answered the door and signed for the package. Federal agents then approached the house and executed a federal search warrant. During the search, agents recovered the package, as well McFarland’s cellular phone.The defendant admitted to agents that he ordered both the April 2017 package and the January 2018 package, knowing that they contained counterfeit pills. An analysis of McFarland’s cellular phone revealed several searches for “fake Viagra,” related searches for pictures of real and counterfeit Viagra pills, searches for terms such as “package us customs detainment,” and photos that were cached from websites including “how to get Viagra for $1.”The plea is the result of an investigation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations, under the direction of Special Agent-in-Charge Kevin Kelly; Customs and Border Protection, under the direction of Director of Field Operations Rose Brophy; and the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, under the direction of Special Agent-in-Charge Jeffrey Ebersole, New York Field Office.Sentencing is scheduled for May 23, 2019, at 10:00 a.m. before Judge Larimer.# # # #Topic(s):Drug TraffickingComponent(s):USAO - New York, Western"

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseOctober 22, 2018United States Department of JusticeEastern District of KentuckyLEXINGTON, Ky.– Cooley Medical Equipment, Inc., an Eastern Kentucky medical equipment supplier headquartered in Prestonsburg, Kentucky, has agreed to pay $5,254,912 to resolve allegations that it violated the False Claims Act by submitting false or fraudulent claims that misrepresented the ingredients used in certain compounded medical creams.Cooley previously operated a pharmacy in Prestonsburg that in 2015 began making compounded medical creams.  Compounding pharmacies, like Cooley’s, prepare customized medications for individual patients, usually by mixing ingredients in order to create a prescription cream.  Cooley billed these prescriptions to government insurers, including Medicare, Kentucky Medicaid, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration (known as CHAMPVA).  Cooley was required by CHAMPVA and Kentucky Medicaid to obtain their prior authorization in order to use bulk powder forms of Lidocaine and Prilocaine as ingredients in its compounded creams. Without such prior authorization, Kentucky Medicaid and CHAMPVA would not reimburse Cooley for the creams.  Medicare, through its Part D program, does not cover bulk powder ingredients at all.Rather than go through the prior authorization process, or face limited reimbursement from Medicare Part D, Cooley misrepresented the nature of its Lidocaine and Prilocaine ingredients in its claims to federal insurers, falsely stating that Cooley’s compounded medical creams were made with cream-based Lidocaine and Prilocaine ingredients, instead of the bulk powder Cooley actually used.  This practice led to the submission of thousands of false claims by Cooley between January 2015 and December 2016, and millions of dollars in improper reimbursements.  Cooley did voluntarily self-disclose this misconduct to the United States Attorney’s Office, took proactive steps to resolve the problem, and no longer operates a compounding pharmacy.Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Cooley will be allowed to pay back the $5,254,912, plus interest, over a period of 6 years.  Because Cooley self-disclosed the misconduct, it was able to resolve its liability for only 1.5 times the amount of monetary loss caused by its false claims; by statute, the False Claims Act typically imposes liability for 3 times the amount of loss suffered by the government.  In addition, because of Cooley’s self-disclosure, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, which administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, has agreed not to pursue any administrative action against Cooley that would exclude it from further participation in those federal programs.“The Department of Justice, and our Office, take seriously the responsibility to aggressively pursue False Claims Act cases, as payment of false or fraudulent claims reduces the pool of money available to pay legitimate claims,” stated United States Attorney Robert M. Duncan, Jr.  “Recovering false or fraudulent payments is an essential component of our Affirmative Civil Enforcement efforts and defends the financial integrity of these government programs.  We will continue to prioritize these important cases.”This settlement was a result of an investigation by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Kentucky and the United States Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigation (FDA-OCI).  An investigation of individuals within Cooley who were responsible for this misconduct is ongoing.  Assistant United States Attorney Paul McCaffrey handled the matter for the United States.  Cooley admits the allegations contained in the Settlement Agreement, but there been no judicial determination of liability.Topic(s):Health Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - Kentucky, EasternFalse Claims Act"

The court also unsealed an additional two plea agreements and an information charging another individual and his company for their role in the scheme.Andrew Assad, 33, of Palm Harbor, Florida, Peter Bolos, 41, of Lutz, Florida, and Michael Palso, 44, of Odessa, Florida, were indicted along with their compounding pharmacies, Synergy Pharmacy Services, located in Palm Harbor, and Precision Pharmacy Management, located in Clearwater. Co-conspirator Larry Everett Smith, 48, of Pinellas Park, Florida, also a pharmacy compounder, and his companies Tanith Enterprises, ULD Wholesale Group, Alpha-Omega Pharmacy, all located in Clearwater, Germaine Pharmacy located in Tampa, Florida, and Zoetic Pharmacy located in Houston, Texas, were all also named as defendants. All the defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit health care fraud, mail fraud, and introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce.On September 26, 2018, HealthRight LLC, a telemedicine company with locations in Pennsylvania and Florida, and Scott Roix, 52, of Seminole, Florida, and the CEO of HealthRight, pleaded guilty to felony conspiracy for their roles in the telemedicine health care fraud scheme in a criminal information. Roix and HealthRight LLC, also pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit wire fraud in a separate scheme for fraudulently telemarketing dietary supplements, skin creams, and testosterone.The indictment alleges that from June 1, 2015 through April 1, 2018, these individuals and companies, together with other persons and companies known to the grand jury, conspired to deceive tens of thousands of patients and more than 100 doctors located in the Eastern District of Tennessee and across the country for the purpose of defrauding private health care benefit programs such as Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee out of approximately $174,000,000. The indictment further alleges that the defendants submitted not less than $931,000,000 in fraudulent claims for payment.According to the indictment, the defendants set up an elaborate telemedicine scheme in which HealthRight fraudulently solicited insurance coverage information and prescriptions from consumers across the country for prescription pain creams and other similar products. The indictment states that doctors approved the prescriptions without knowing that the defendants were massively marking up the prices of the invalidly prescribed drugs, which the defendants then billed to private insurance carriers.Assad, Bolos, Palso, and Smith appeared in court on October 11, 2018 before U.S. Magistrate Judge Anthony E. Porcelli in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida.

The companies face fines of up to twice the gross loss sustained as a result of the conspiracy. The indictment also seeks forfeiture of approximately $154,000,000.In addition to their roles in the health care fraud conspiracy, the Information filed against Roix and HealthRight charged each of them with conspiring to commit wire fraud as part of a scheme to use HealthRight’s telemarketing facilities to fraudulently sell millions of dollars’ worth of products such as weight loss pills, skin creams, and testosterone supplements through concocted claims of efficacy and intentionally deficient customer service designed to stall consumer complaints.Roix and HealthRight pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge J. Ronnie Greer of the Eastern District of Tennessee. Roix faces a statutory maximum sentence of 5 years of imprisonment for each conspiracy. The Court set sentencing for February 13, 2019.The investigation was coordinated by Assistant U.S. Attorneys T.J.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseNovember 5, 2018United States Department of JusticeDistrict of MontanaBILLINGS – The U.S. Attorney’s office announced today that on Nov. 2, Donald Friedlich Mills, III, a nurse who admitted stealing fentanyl, a highly addictive and dangerous synthetic opioid pain reliever, for his own use, was sentenced to a five-year term of probation with six months in home confinement.U.S. District Judge Susan Watters presided at the hearing.Mills, 33, of Billings, pleaded guilty on May 22 to tampering with consumer products and to acquiring fentanyl by misrepresentation, fraud, forgery and deception. There was no plea agreement.The investigation began on March 21, 2017, when the Billings Clinic, where Mills worked, notified the federal Drug Enforcement Administration that it had lost 200 mL of fentanyl from employee pilferage. In a recorded interview with DEA on March 28, 2017, Mills, after being advised of his rights, said he had neck pain and anxiety and thought he could self-medicate through injections.Mill told law enforcement officers he started taking fentanyl and replacing it with saline beginning in February 2017 and ending on March 13, 2017, when he was confronted about discrepancies.Mills further told officers that he would divert fentanyl most times that he worked, remove the fentanyl from the vials and replace it with saline. He said that if the case was his, he made sure the patients got a full vial along with whatever he had switched.DEA took into evidence suspected tampered vials of fentanyl, syringes and vials labeled as saline. The evidence included 22 packages of fentanyl suspected of having been tampered. A DEA lab tested 15 of the packages and found that no fentanyl remained inside them.In a sentencing memo, Assistant U.S. Attorney Tom Godfrey said Mills could have taken the fentanyl without replacing it with saline but that would have led to the tampering being discovered sooner. “The defendant chose to be deceptive and replace the fentanyl with saline water in order to continue to have access to the drug, knowing the risk it would pose to patients,” Godfrey said.AUSA Godfrey prosecuted the case, which was investigated by the DEA.U.S. Attorney Kurt Alme said, “This is a serious crime. By replacing fentanyl with saline, Mills put patients at risk of not having their severe pain properly treated. In addition, diverting fentanyl from its intended use can have lethal consequences to a community. Thankfully, that did not occur in this case. I want to thank Assistant U.S. Attorney Godfrey, the DEA and the Food and Drug Administration-Office of Criminal Investigations, for their successful investigation and prosecution of the case, after being alerted to the theft of fentanyl by Billings Clinic.”“Patients deserve to have confidence that they are receiving the proper treatment from those entrusted with providing their medical care,” said LisaL. Malinowski, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Los Angeles Field Office. “We must hold medical personnel accountable when they take advantage of their unique position and tamper with drugs needed by their patients, especially when such tampering causes unnecessary pain and suffering.”DEA Resident Agent-in-Charge Stacy Zinn-Brittain stated, “DEA is committed to working this type of investigation to keep patients safe during medical procedures. We appreciated Billings Clinic’s cooperation in working with DEA on this investigation.”XXXComponent(s):USAO - MontanaContact:Clair Johnson Howard Public Affairs Officer 406-247-4623"

Smith also ordered Michael Slonski, 48, to serve 3 years supervised release upon completion of his term of incarceration.Slonski pled guilty on April 2, 2018, to conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute Oxycodone.Slonski’s sentence is announced by United States Attorney Aaron L. Weisman and Jeffrey Ebersole, Resident Agent in Charge of the United States Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations.At the time of his guilty plea, Slonski admitted to being part of a conspiracy that created fraudulent prescriptions utilizing the identities, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) identification numbers, and signatures of medical practitioners without their consent. Prescriptions for varying amounts of Oxycodone pills were written and presented to pharmacies by some members of the conspiracy and others working at the direction of the conspirators.The scheme often times included the fraudulent use of medical insurance to pay pharmacies for the illicit prescriptions. Most of the Oxycodone pills gained with the use of fraudulent prescriptions were sold to others for distribution.Slonski admitted that his role in the conspiracy included producing fraudulent Oxycodone prescriptions, passing or causing others to fill the prescriptions at pharmacies, and benefiting personally by selling fraudulently obtained pills.Robert Rose, 52, of Providence, the acknowledged leader of the conspiracy, was sentenced on October 15, 2018, to 72 months in federal prison. Rose admitted to the Court that as the leader of the conspiracy, he paid for individuals’ identities, health care insurance information, and prescribing medical practitioners’ names and DEA numbers. Rose provided that information to others who participated in the conspiracy, and provided special paper necessary to produce the fraudulent prescriptions.Rose also admitted that he ran the conspiracy for several months while incarcerated at the Adult Correctional Institution on an unrelated matter.The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Dulce Donovan.The matter was investigated by the United States Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations.###Topic(s):Drug TraffickingOpioidsComponent(s):USAO - Rhode IslandContact:Jim Martin (401) 709-5357Press Release Number:19-14"

Scott Twaddle was ordered to serve one year of supervised release following his imprisonment and pay a $10,000 fine. Both defendants forfeited $200,000 in U.S. currency seized from their residence during the investigation and were ordered to pay $100 to the Crime Victims’ Fund.According to the plea agreements entered on July 25, 2018, the Twaddles admitted that from about October 2014 to December 7, 2016, with the intent to defraud and mislead state and federal regulators, the Twaddles sold certain injectable Vitamin B12 prescription drugs to end users through websites, including www.medsupplystore.net. The Twaddles sold these prescription drugs, which were also “unapproved new drugs” without first obtaining prescriptions from the end user. Previously, in June 2014, the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the Iowa Board of Pharmacy conducted an on-site inspection of Medical Supply Liquidators LLC, a warehouse and distributor of prescription drugs including various assortments of injectable Vitamin B12, operated by the Twaddles in the Des Moines area. At that time, the Twaddles dispensed prescription drugs without any valid prescriptions to end users via www.medicalsupplyliquidators.com. In June 2014, the FDA inspection team specifically informed the Twaddles that their distribution of prescription drugs without first receiving proof of a prescription from the customer violated federal law.“Illegally dispensing prescription drugs can put consumers’ health at risk,” said Charles L.

Brady announced today.Gennady Nudelman, 42, pleaded guilty to one count before United States District Judge David S. Cercone.In connection with the guilty plea, the court was advised that Nudelman was involved in a complex conspiracy related to the fraudulent processing of credit card payments. The credit card companies will not allow their products and services to be used to pay for certain precluded activities, including the on-line sales of pharmaceutical drugs and of products violating trademark infringement laws. The defendant participated in the conspiracy designed to conceal from the credit card companies the fact they used their products and services to pay for precluded activities and to subvert the internal controls the credit card companies had in place to detect and prevent this type of activity. The fraud involved establishing shell corporations and web sites associated with the shell companies that falsely claimed that they sold products other than pharmaceutical drugs or products that violated trademark infringement laws. The conspirators then applied for merchant accounts from the credit card companies in the names of the shell corporations and the fake web sites. Once the merchant accounts were established, they were used to process payments for pharmaceutical drugs or products that violated trademark infringement laws. Additionally, the conspirators arranged for the credit card statements sent to the consumers to have the names of the shell corporations and telephone numbers. The conspirators set up a telephone bank to receive calls from customers questioning billings on their credit card statements, and the conspirators explained to the customers the true nature of the transactions in hopes of avoiding charge-backs that could cause the credit card companies to question the legitimacy of the transactions.Judge Cercone scheduled sentencing for April 29, 2019 at 11 a.m. The law provides for a total sentence of 30 years in prison, a fine of $1,000,000, or both.

Gillette, 31, of Albany, Ohio, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to having a medicated calf slaughtered with the intention of selling it as beef for human consumption. The calf was contaminated with Gentamicin, which is not approved for use in cattle.Benjamin C. Glassman, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, and Mark S. McCormack, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Field Office announced the plea entered into today before U.S. District Judge Timothy S. Black.According to the statement of facts in this case, since 2009, Gillette has operated as a livestock dealer and hauler as the owner of Cory Gillette Farm in Athens County.Gillette transported a calf from Southern Ohio to a slaughter facility in Addison, Ill., where it was intended to be sold as beef for human consumption. The calf was slaughtered and subject to random inspection. During that inspection, the calf tested positive for Gentamicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic.When an investigator from the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations interviewed Gillette about the contaminated calf, Gillette lied and said he purchased the calf at a livestock auction in Zanesville, Ohio. In fact, he had not purchased the calf there, and misled investigators in an attempt to impede their ability to trace the contamination back to its source.“As part of his plea, Gillette admitted he often bought injured, ill and potentially medicated animals at a discounted price with the intention of selling the animals to slaughter facilities and maximizing his profit,” said U.S. Attorney Glassman.“The FDA, in partnership with the USDA, is vigilant in keeping antibiotics and other residual animal drugs out of the human food supply in the United States by carefully monitoring food-producing animals,” said Special Agent in Charge McCormack. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who put public health at risk by selling food-producing animals that do not meet federal standards.”Gillette was charged by a bill of information in September 2018. He pleaded guilty to one count of introducing adulterated food into interstate commerce, a crime punishable by up to one year in prison, and one count of making false statements to federal agents, a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.U.S. Attorney Glassman commended the investigation of this case by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations and Assistant United States Attorney Ebunoluwa A.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseFebruary 22, 2019United States Department of JusticeEastern District of PennsylvaniaPHILADELPHIA, PA – United States Attorney William M. McSwain announced today that Lehigh Valley Technologies, Inc. (“LVT”) agreed to a $4 million settlement of allegations under the False Claims Act that it designed a scheme to avoid paying fees associated with new drug applications to the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).  LVT is a pharmaceutical company engaged in the development and commercialization of certain human drug products that is located in Allentown, Pennsylvania.The FDA regulates the approval of new drugs.  A company seeking such approval must submit and receive FDA approval of a new drug application (“NDA”) before the drug may be marketed or sold in the United States.  The NDA application is the vehicle through which drug sponsors formally propose that the FDA approve a new drug for sale and marketing.Congress created the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) in 1992 that authorizes and requires  the FDA to collect a “prescription drug user fee” or “application fee” from companies that submit an NDA.  PDUFA gives the FDA a revenue source to fund the new drug approval process.Under 21 U.S.C. § 379h(d)(1)(C), the FDA will grant a waiver of the fee to a small business applicant submitting its first application.  In making that determination, the FDA must consider “any affiliate of the applicant,” including large businesses or businesses that have already received the fee waiver.  One significant purpose of the fee waiver is to incentivize and level the playing field for small businesses that submit an NDA.  Limiting the waiver to first-time applicants allows a new, small business to enter the industry without the significant costs to entry that the NDA fee would otherwise impose.Here, LVT had previously received a fee waiver in 2010 for its Oxycodone Hydrochloride NDA. Because it received that fee waiver, LVT was ineligible to receive another such fee waiver.  LVT subsequently desired to submit two NDAs relating to potassium chloride for oral solution.  Had LVT submitted the NDAs in its own name, the FDA would have required it to pay fees totaling over $2 million.Knowing that it was ineligible, LVT allegedly developed a scheme with two companies to avoid the fees.  Under the terms of the agreements, LVT paid the companies to submit NDAs for potassium chloride for oral solution in their own name.  LVT’s payment to the companies was contingent upon the FDA granting waivers from the prescription drug user fee.  LVT prepared and controlled all of the submissions that the companies made to the FDA relating to the NDA approval.  Neither LVT nor the companies disclosed to the government the agreements despite the government’s request for such information.  Not knowing of the agreements, the FDA granted fee waivers and approved both NDAs.“As alleged, the sole purpose of the arrangement was for those companies to serve as a front and allow LVT to avoid the FDA fees that the FDA otherwise would have required it to pay,” said U.S. Attorney William M. McSwain.  “The arrangement was illegal.  Like we did today, we will hold companies accountable that scheme to avoid the fees that enable the FDA to carry out its vitally important drug approval process.”“The FDA laws and accompanying regulations for funding drug approvals are designed, in part, to encourage companies, even small businesses, to create new drugs,” said Mark S. McCormack, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Field Office.  “When companies attempt to game the system to avoid paying these critical fees, we will bring them to justice.”This case was investigated by FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations.  For the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the investigation and settlement were handled by Civil Chief Gregory B. David, Auditor Denis Cooke, and former extern Bianca A. Valcarce.Topic(s):False Claims ActComponent(s):USAO - Pennsylvania, Eastern"

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseDecember 13, 2018United States Department of JusticeDistrict of MassachusettsBOSTON – An owner and four former employees of New England Compounding Center (NECC) were convicted today by a federal jury for their roles at NECC, the company that caused the 2012 nationwide fungal meningitis outbreak. The outbreak was the largest public health crisis ever caused by a pharmaceutical drug. With today’s convictions, 11 former owners, executives, and employees of NECC have been convicted of federal criminal charges.“These defendants were professionals who acted recklessly to the extreme detriment of public health,” said United States Attorney Andrew Lelling. “Over the course of years, the defendants callously disregarded patient health by cutting corners and prioritizing profits over safety. And they got away with it by defrauding federal and state regulators. The result was contaminated, deficient, deadly drugs that never should have been made or distributed. Ultimately, the jury found the defendants’ fraudulent conduct wrong and deserving of punishment. I applaud the prosecutors and the investigative team on their dogged determination to bring us another step closer to justice for the victims and their families.”“A key aspect of the FDA’s mission is to ensure that drugs are made under high quality conditions to prevent patient harm due to poorly compounded products,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “This episode was a tragic reminder of why compounding and compounded drugs can present serious risks to patients. We’ve taken significant new steps to ensure the quality of compounded drugs and improve patient safety, in order to prevent another calamity like the episode involving NECC. However, we continue to see significant risk associated with some compounded drugs, and firms that produce and ship drugs in bulk without any regard for product quality and patient safety. We’re increasing our oversight in this space to crack down on activity that puts patients at risk. At the same time, we’re continuing to advance new policies to help responsible firms that are seeking to stay in compliance with quality standards find efficient ways to meet those requirements.”“These defendants callously ignored their professional responsibilities to protect patient safety,” said Harold H. Shaw, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Boston Division. “Their failure to safeguard the public played a significant role in the distribution of medicines that were harmful. The FBI will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to combat fraud and abuse in the health care system, so that we can do everything we possibly can to protect the American public from harm.”Following an 8-week trial, the following defendants were found guilty by a federal jury:Gene Svirskiy, 37, of Ashland, Mass., a former NECC clean room pharmacist, who supervised NECC’s production of high-risk heart medications, was convicted of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, 10 counts of mail fraud, and two counts of introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce with intent to defraud or mislead. Judge Richard G. Stearns scheduled Svirskiy’s sentencing for March 11, 2018. Svirskiy faces a sentence of no greater than 20 years in prison.Christopher Leary, 34, of Shrewsbury, Mass., an NECC clean room pharmacist, was convicted of three counts of mail fraud, one count of introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce with intent to defraud or mislead, and two counts of introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce. Leary’s sentencing is scheduled for March 14, 2018. Leary faces a sentence of no greater than 20 years in prison.Sharon Carter, 54, of Hopkinton, Mass., NECC’s former director of operations, was convicted of conspiracy to defraud the United States.  Carter’s sentencing is scheduled for March 21, 2018. She faces a sentence of no greater than five years in prison.Alla Stepanets, 38, of Framingham, Mass., one of NECC’s verification pharmacists, was convicted of six counts of introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce. Sentencing is scheduled for March 26, 2018. She faces a sentence of no greater than one year in prison.Greg Conigliaro, 53, of Southborough, Mass., a former owner of NECC, was convicted of conspiracy to defraud the United States. Judge Stearns scheduled Conigliaro’s sentencing for March 28, 2018. He faces a sentence of no greater than five years in prison.Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.Joseph Evanosky, 46, of Westford, Mass., a former clean room pharmacist, was acquitted.In 2012, 753 patients in 20 states were diagnosed with a fungal infection after receiving injections of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) manufactured by NECC. Of those 753 patients, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 64 patients in nine states died. The government has since identified a total of 793 patients throughout the country harmed by NECC’s contaminated MPA. More than 100 patients have now died.The criminal investigation revealed that in addition to the contaminated MPA, NECC’s other pharmacists, including Svirskiy and Leary, knowingly made and sold numerous drugs in a similar unsafe manner and in insanitary conditions. The unsafe manner included, among other things, the pharmacists’ failure to properly sterilize NECC’s drugs, failure to properly test NECC’s drugs for sterility, and failure to wait for test results before sending the drugs to customers. They also approved the use of expired drug ingredients, and the mislabeling of those drugs in order to deceive customers. The insanitary conditions included, among other things, NECC’s lack of proper cleaning and NECC’s failure to take any action when its own environmental monitoring repeatedly detected mold and bacteria within NECC’s clean rooms throughout 2012.NECC repeatedly took steps to shield its operations from regulatory oversight by the FDA by claiming to be a pharmacy dispensing drugs pursuant to valid, patient-specific prescriptions. In fact, NECC routinely dispensed drugs in bulk without valid prescriptions. Despite this practice, Conigliaro, an owner of NECC, repeatedly misrepresented to the FDA and the Massachusetts Board of Pharmacy that NECC was only dispensing drugs pursuant to patient-specific prescriptions. Carter, NECC’s director of operations, directed employees to engage in a number of fraudulent prescription schemes to deceive regulators by creating the appearance that NECC had prescriptions for the drugs it was selling. To that end, defendant Stepanets, one of NECC’s verification pharmacists, was convicted of approving shipments of drugs for patients with names such as Wonder Woman, Fat Albert, Bud Weiser, Samuel Adams, Hindsight Man, Betty Ford, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Calvin Klein and Jennifer Lopez.“Today’s verdicts demonstrate the ongoing commitment of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) to ensure the integrity of TRICARE, the U.S. Defense Department’s health care program,” stated Special Agent-in-Charge Leigh-Alistair Barzey, DCIS Northeast Field Office. “DCIS will continue to work with its law enforcement partners and the U.S. Attorney's Office to identify individuals and companies who disregard laws and regulations involving pharmaceuticals and, in so doing, endanger the health and safety of U.S. military members and their families.”“It is appalling that NECC staff engaged in this blatant fraudulent activity with such reckless disregard for patient safety,” said Sean Smith, Special Agent in Charge of the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General, Criminal Investigations Division. “This verdict should send a clear message to individuals and businesses that VA OIG and its law enforcement partners will vigorously investigate healthcare fraud that puts the public and veterans at risk.”“Today’s verdicts demonstrate the commitment of the U.S Postal Inspection Service to bring justice to those who put our customers, the American public, at risk,” said U.S. Postal Inspection Service’s Inspector in Charge, Joseph W. Cronin of the Boston Division. “The cooperation and hard work of our fellow law enforcement agencies and the Department of Justice illustrates the common mission of protecting our citizens.”In June 2017, Barry Cadden, the former owner and head pharmacist for NECC, was sentenced to nine years in prison and three years of supervised release after being convicted of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud and mislead. In January 2018, Glenn Chin, NECC’s former supervisory pharmacist, was sentenced to eight years in prison and two years of supervised release after being convicted of 77 counts.Two remaining defendants, Kathy Chin, and Michelle Thomas, of Cumberland, R.I., both of whom were former verification pharmacists, are scheduled to stand trial on March 25, 2019.U.S. Attorney Lelling, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb, M.D., FBI SAC Shaw, DCIS SAC Barzey, VA OIG SAC Smith, and Inspector Cronin made the announcement today.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys George P. Varghese and Amanda P.M. Strachan of Lelling’s Criminal Division prosecuted the case.Topic(s):Health Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - Massachusetts"

LOUIS, MO – Two companies were sentenced in federal court today relating to their introduction of adulterated and misbranded pet food ingredients into interstate commerce.Wilbur-Ellis Company is a California limited liability company with headquarters in San Francisco, California.  The Feed Division of Wilbur-Ellis marketed and distributed products and ingredients for use in the pet food industry, including animal proteins used in the manufacture of dog food and cat food. Diversified Ingredients, Inc., a Missouri corporation with headquarters in Ballwin, Missouri, is a commodities broker, merchandiser, and distributor whose customers included a number of pet food companies and manufacturers.“The FDA recognizes the importance of preserving the integrity of the food supply for animals,” said Charles Grinstead, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Kansas City Field Office. “Substituting inferior ingredients in pet food is against the law, and the FDA, working with its federal and state partners, will take action as necessary to hold ingredient suppliers accountable for distributing such products.”Wilbur-Ellis Company was sentenced by U.S. Magistrate Judge Nannette A. Baker to three years of probation and ordered to pay $4,549,682 in restitution, criminal forfeiture in the form of a money judgment in the amount of $964,442, and a fine of $1,000. Diversified Ingredients was sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay $1.5 million in restitution, criminal forfeiture in the form of a money judgment in an amount of $75,000, and a fine of $2,000.On April 25, 2018, Wilbur-Ellis Company pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of introducing adulterated food into interstate commerce. On July 10, 2018, Diversified Ingredients pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of introducing adulterated food into interstate commerce and one misdemeanor count of introducing misbranded food into interstate commerce.  In connection with the guilty pleas, the court was advised that pet food ingredients shipped from a Wilbur-Ellis facility in Rosser, Texas – specifically, chicken meal and turkey meal – were adulterated and misbranded through the use of cheaper substitute ingredients, such as feather meal and feed grade chicken bone by-product meal, and adulterated and misbranded by omitting premium ingredients, such as turkey meal, from products identified as turkey meal. The adulterated pet food ingredients did not pose a threat to the health or safety of any animal.Because the defendants are organizations, they were subject to a fine and a period of probation for their offense. Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the actual sentence imposed is based upon the seriousness of the offense and the prior criminal history, if any, of the defendant.This case is being investigated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, the FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Charles Birmingham, Gil Sison, and Kyle Bateman, Special Attorneys to the United States Attorney General, are prosecuting the case on behalf of the government.Component(s):USAO - Missouri, Western"

Dr. Roberts violated her professional duty to ‘do no harm’ and instead subjected her patients to an incredible risk of injury,” said Billy J. Williams, U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon.“U.S. consumers rely on FDA oversight to ensure that the drugs and medical devices they use are safe and effective. Rogue health care professionals who obtain foreign unapproved medical products, and dispense and administer those products to their patients, put the health of those patients at significant risk,” said Lisa L. Malinowski, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Los Angeles Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who choose to put the public’s health at such risk.”According to court documents, beginning in 2008, Roberts provided medical services from her home in Troutdale as a supplement to her full-time position with an outside medical practice. Roberts would purchase Botox and Juvaderm from websites including BuckaDayPharmacy.com, AllDayChemist.com and FindlandiaPharmacy.com that were manufactured for distribution in foreign countries, but not approved for use in the U.S. Roberts would administer Botox and Juvaderm to clients from her home office.The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigated Roberts for dispensing controlled substances over the internet. During their investigation, the DEA learned of Roberts administering Botox to patients in her home and referred the matter to the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI) for further investigation. Roberts resolved these claims via a monetary civil settlement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office Civil Division in May 2018.Roberts previously pleaded guilty to one count of receipt in interstate commerce of adulterated or misbranded drugs or devices and delivery for pay in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 331(c) on June 19, 2018.This case was investigated by FDA-OCI and DEA and was prosecuted by Donna B.

        "content": "LOS ANGELES– Four companies and three individuals have agreed to plead guilty to federal criminal charges related to the illegal importation and sale of $11 million worth of pharmaceutical-grade erectile dysfunction drugs that were falsely marketed as herbal remedies for men.Federal prosecutors today filed two new cases against distributors of the misbranded drugs.In one of the cases filed today in United States District Court, Jin Su Park, 40, of Hacienda Heights, agreed to plead guilty to one felony count of importing contraband into the United States and one felony count of introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce. Park’s company, RNG Global Management and Trading Group, Inc., based in Rowland Heights, agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts of introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce.In another case filed today, Lancaster Distributors, Inc., a Salem, Oregon-based company, and one of its employees, Matthew Burroughs, 42, of Salem, each agreed to plead guilty to one misdemeanor count of conspiracy to introduce misbranded drugs into interstate commerce.Last month, Park’s friend and former colleague, John Seil Lee, 40, of Walnut, agreed to plead guilty to a seven-count information that charged him with felony counts of conspiracy, importing contraband into the United States, filing a false tax return, and introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce. Lee’s companies – KHK International Trade Enterprise, Inc., and SHH World Trading Enterprises, Inc. – also agreed to plead guilty to the charges.According to the documents filed in Lee’s case, from 2011 through early 2017, Lee illegally imported shipments of powder Tadalafil – a prescription drug used to treat erectile dysfunction and sold under the brand name Cialis – from suppliers in China. Lee then manufactured the powder Tadalafil into at least 5.5 million pills that he sold to distributors across the United States. In order to boost sales, Lee made the pills with up to 14 times the level of Tadalafil contained in Cialis, court papers state.Lee sold at least $11 million worth of pills across the United States – under names such as “X Again,” “X Monster” and “Royal Master” – with labels that did not disclose the presence of Tadalafil and falsely stated that no prescription was necessary, according to court documents. Lee also continued selling the pills despiteFDA announcementsthat the pills were tainted because they contained undeclared Tadalafil. In order to evade federal regulators, Lee relabeled the tainted pills in response to FDA announcements about their safety, the information states. For example, in August 2016, after the FDA announced that SHH’s “One More Knight” pills contained undisclosed Tadalafil, Lee rebranded the same pills as “Own the Knight” and continued selling them.After Lee closed SHH following the execution of federal search warrants in February 2017, his friend Park set up RNG Global to operate as a copycat business, according to Park’s plea agreement. Park took 14,000 of Lee’s pills, rebranded them as “EEZZY UP PLATINUM,” and sold them to Lee’s former distributors across the country. EEZZY UP’s packaging also failed to disclose that the pills contained Tadalafil.In its plea agreement, Lancaster admitted that it purchased from Lee at least 153,000 male sexual enhancement pills containing Tadalafil for approximately $362,000. Burroughs admitted to purchasing the mislabeled drugs on behalf of Lancaster.The arraignments for Lee, KHK, and SHH have been scheduled for February 19. Once he pleads guilty, Lee will face a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years for the smuggling count, five years for the conspiracy count, and three years for the tax count.The arraignments for Park, RNG Global, Burroughs, and Lancaster have been scheduled for March 18. Park faces a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years for the smuggling count and three years for the distribution count. Burroughs faces a statutory maximum sentence of one year in prison.The FDA’s approval of Cialis is limited to the use under the supervision of a licensed professional. Due to toxicity and other potentially harmful effects – including life-threatening drops in blood pressure, loss of vision, loss of hearing and prolonged, painful erections that can result in permanent injury – drugs similar to Cialis are not safe for use except under the supervision of a medical practitioner.The investigation into these cases was conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations, the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations and IRS Criminal Investigation.The cases are being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Matthew W. O’Brien of the Environmental and Community Safety Crimes Section.Hidden active pharmaceutical ingredients have been identified in products promoted not only for sexual enhancement, but also for bodybuilding, pain relief and weight loss. The FDA has issued hundreds of public warnings and recall announcements related to these types of fraudulent products. The FDA’sTainted Products databasecan help consumers identify some of these potentially harmful products. Even if a product is not included in the list, consumers should be cautious about using certain products, especially those promoted for sexual enhancement, weight loss, bodybuilding and pain relief.Component(s):USAO - California, CentralContact:Thom Mrozek Spokesperson/Public Affairs Officer United States Attorney’s Office Central District of California (Los Angeles) 213-894-6947Press Release Number:19-016"

Lampert, Special Agent-in-Charge, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), New York Region, announced the settlement.“Dr. Fleckner bypassed the FDA’s regulatory authority by purchasing and administering unapproved pharmaceutical products in violation of Medicare regulations,” stated United States Attorney Donoghue.  “The settlement holds Dr. Fleckner accountable for his actions and ensures that Medicare funds will only be used for FDA-approved pharmaceuticals.”“FDA’s oversight of prescription drugs protects consumers from illicit medicines obtained from unauthorized foreign sources,” stated FDA-OCI Special Agent-in-Charge Ebersole.  “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who place profits over their patients’ safety.”“FDA approval provides confidence to millions of patients that drugs are safe when prescribed appropriately,” stated HHS-OIG Special Agent-in-Charge Lampert.  “Those administering unapproved medications – as contended in this case – put patients at risk and burden taxpayers.”The government’s investigation revealed that from at least July 1, 2014 to June 27, 2017, Dr. Fleckner purchased the Unapproved Drugs because they were less expensive than drugs that were approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States.  Medicare reimburses physician-administered drugs at a set rate based on the average sales price of the respective FDA approved, physician-administered drug in the United States.  Dr. Fleckner was thus able to profit from the “spread” between the reimbursement rates he received based on FDA-approved drugs and the lower amounts he paid for the Unapproved Drugs.  The United States contends that the Unapproved Drugs were not eligible for reimbursement by Medicare.  The settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing by Dr. Fleckner.The United States’ investigation was handled by former Assistant U.S. Attorney Kenneth M.

Glassman, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, Angela L. Byers, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cincinnati Division, Lamont Pugh, Special Agent in Charge, Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, Mark S. McCormack, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Metro Washington Field Office, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, Steven W. Schierholt, Executive Director, State of Ohio Board of Pharmacy and Jim Wernecke, Director, Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation special investigations department, announced the sentence handed down today by U.S. District Judge Michael H. Watson.According to court records, Mascio, a licensed pharmacist and owner of Family Medical Pharmacy and Visions Systems in Columbus, Ohio, executed a health care fraud scheme for at least a decade (from 2003 through 2013). Her scheme caused a loss of $1.1 million.Mascio schemed to defraud Medicare, Ohio Medicaid, Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation and private insurers by billing for sample drugs that could not be legally sold and for medications that had not been dispensed.Mascio owned an office building on Karl Road in which her pharmacy and the medical offices of two doctors were located. Mascio directed pharmacy employees to remove prescription drug samples from the medical offices and place them in a storage room used by the pharmacy.After collecting the drug samples, Mascio or employees under her direction removed the drugs from their individualized packaging and stored them in plastic bins. They disposed of the sample packaging in the dumpster located on the premises of the pharmacy and placed the sample drugs into the pharmacy inventory where they were co-mingled with the pharmacy’s stocked drugs and dispensed to the general public.Mascio also orchestrated the submission of false claims for the sample drugs to health care benefit programs, including Medicare, Ohio Medicaid and Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation.She pleaded guilty in May to one count of health care fraud scheme and one count of conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States.“Mascio’s criminal conduct included breaking into several physician offices and stealing large quantities of sample prescription drugs before shucking them from their original packaging,” U.S. Attorney Glassman said. “By misbranding the drugs, there was no method by which the drugs could be identified should there be a recall by the manufacturer, nor was there any way to determine the expiration date or whether the drugs remained effective. This is clearly a danger to the community, and we will continue to identify and prosecute this sort of criminal behavior.”“Patients who are taking prescription medications need to be able to trust that the medicine that is being dispensed to them is safe and effective” said Lamont Pugh III, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General – Chicago Region. “This defendant violated that trust and put her personal greed above the public’s health and safety. The OIG will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to ensure that medical professionals who commit criminal acts such as this are held accountable.”“Our goal is to protect Ohio families, and fighting health care fraud is a priority,” said Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine. “In this case, the defendant carried on her scheme for over a decade and put people at risk. We appreciate the cooperation of our law enforcement partners in holding her accountable.”U.S. Attorney Glassman commended the investigation of this case by the FBI, Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General, Ohio Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, State of Ohio Board of Pharmacy, Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation and FDA, as well as Assistant United States Attorney Kenneth F. Affeldt and Special Assistant United States Attorney Maritsa A.

(Galena) will pay more than $7.55 million to resolve allegations under the civil False Claims Act that it paid kickbacks to doctors to induce them to prescribe its fentanyl-based drug Abstral, the Department of Justice announced today.“Given the dangers associated with opioids such as Abstral, it is imperative that prescriptions be based on a patient’s medical need rather than a doctor’s financial interests,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Chad A. Readler of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department of Justice intends to vigorously pursue those who offer and receive illegal inducements that undermine the integrity of government health care programs.”“The conduct alleged by the government and resolved by today’s settlement was egregious because it incentivized doctors to over-prescribe highly addictive opioids,” said Acting U.S. Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick for the District of New Jersey. “This settlement constitutes another example of the Department of Justice’s ongoing efforts to battle the opioid epidemic on every front.”The United States contends that Galena paid multiple types of kickbacks to induce doctors to prescribe Abstral, including providing more than 85 free meals to doctors and staff from a single, high-prescribing practice; paying doctors $5,000, and speakers $6,000, plus expenses, to attend an “advisory board” that was partly planned, and attended, by Galena sales team members and paying approximately $92,000 to a physician-owned pharmacy under a performance-based rebate agreement to induce the owners to prescribe Abstral. The United States also contends that Galena paid doctors to refer patients to the company’s RELIEF patient registry study, which was nominally designed to collect data on patient experiences with Abstral, but acted as a means to induce the doctors to prescribe Abstral. Galena has not marketed any pharmaceutical drug since the end of 2015.Two of the doctors who received remuneration from Galena were tried, convicted and latersentencedto prison in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama following a jury trial of, among other counts, offenses relating to their prescriptions of Abstral. Galena cooperated in that prosecution.The settlement resolves a lawsuit filed by relator Lynne Dougherty under the whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act, which permit private parties to file suit on behalf of the United States and obtain a portion of the government’s recovery. As part of today’s resolution, Ms. Dougherty will receive more than $1.2 million. The matter remains under seal as to allegations against entities other than Galena.The settlement is the result of a coordinated effort by the Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey, with assistance from the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Counsel to the Inspector General, and the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Field Office.The claims settled by this agreement are allegations only; there have been no admissions of liability by Galena.Topic(s):False Claims ActHealthcare FraudComponent(s):Civil DivisionUSAO - New JerseyPress Release Number:17-980"

(“Barber & Sons”), a cattle company based in Lexington with one count of conspiracy, one count of moving cattle in violation of federal law, and one count of aiding and abetting a false statement.  The indictment also charges veterinarian John M. Moran, 64, of Flemingsburg, Kentucky, with one count of conspiracy, one count of aiding and abetting moving cattle in violation of federal law, and one count of making a false statement.The indictment alleges that Barber & Sons and Moran conspired to violate the Animal Health Protection Act, which protects the health and welfare of the public by preventing, detecting, and eradicating the spread of diseases in animals that are shipped within the United States.  Federal law requires that an accredited veterinarian inspect cattle prior to their shipment, and then file certificates attesting to that inspection with appropriate state authorities.  The indictment alleges that Moran falsely certified he had inspected the cattle Barber & Sons had shipped, when in fact he had merely pre-signed the interstate certificate of veterinary inspection without inspecting the cattle.  According to the indictment, between January 28, 2013 and September 25, 2015, Moran certified at least 600 false interstate certificates of veterinary inspection for shipment of more than 60,000 cattle.  In exchange, he was paid over $19,000 by Barber & Sons.The charges and allegations contained in the indictment are merely accusations.  The defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt in a court of law.The USDA and FDA are investigating the case.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Kate K.

Phillip J. Green, U.S. Magistrate Judge, to two counts of tampering with a consumer product. This federal offense prohibits tampering with a drug or other consumer product with reckless disregard for the risk of death or bodily injury and under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the risk of injury or death. Mollohan faces a maximum sentence of 10 years of imprisonment on each count, and she will be required to serve a term of supervised release after any prison term has been completed. U.S. District Judge Gordon J. Quist will sentence Mollohan on a date to be scheduled by the Court.Mollohan admitted at the plea hearing that, while working as home health nurse in two homes in Allegan and Barry Counties in August 2016, she removed liquid diazepam (valium) from the medication bottles prescribed to three different patients. All three patients were totally incapacitated at the time from serious brain impairment and required twenty-four hour care. Mollohan admitted that she replaced the diazepam with water or saline solution, resulting in the patients’ diazepam containing less than 10% of the declared diazepam concentration in one case, less than 6% of the declared diazepam concentration in the second case, and less than 1% of the declared diazepam concentration in the third case. Mollohan acknowledged that she knew that she put the patients at risk of serious bodily injury or death given that the diazepam was prescribed, in part, to suppress life-threatening seizures. Mollohan further acknowledged that one of the patients suffered a seizure that was likely the result of the patient receiving diluted diazepam. That patient, a minor, died the next day, although the government acknowledges that it cannot prove Mollohan’s conduct resulted in the death.United States Attorney Andrew Birge emphasized that federal laws play an important role in the delivery of safe food, drugs, and cosmetics. \"Cases like this underscore the obvious: tampering with drugs puts the ultimate consumers at real risk of harm.\"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, the Michigan State Police, the Allegan Police Department, and the Barry and Allegan County Prosecutors’ Offices cooperated in the investigation of this matter.

Stratton, 45, of Haverhill, Massachusetts, pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiracy to distribute misbranded prescription animal drugs, United States Attorney Scott W. Murray announced today.According to court documents and statements made in court, from January 2017 through September 2017, defendant Stratton worked at Horsemen’s Tack, Inc. in Newton, New Hampshire.  Among the products Stratton sold to certain customers were equine drugs that were not accompanied by the required prescriptions.  Sales of these drugs defrauded and misled the company’s drug suppliers, federal and state regulators, and the general public.Although the website for Horsemen's Tack indicated that the business had a \"vet on call,\" in fact there was no vet on call.  Instead, Horsemen's Tack had a long-standing relationship with a veterinarian licensed in New Hampshire.  Stratton regularly used the veterinarian's name and license to order prescription animal drugs from mail-order pharmacies even though the veterinarian never visited the Newton store, did not examine horses or meet with horse owners, and provided no actual veterinary services.  During the conspiracy Stratton and Horsemen’s Tack marketed, sold, and distributed numerous drugs for performance-enhancement in racehorses, including levothyroxine, estrone, amikacin, methocarbamol, dexamethasone, tranexamic acid, and erythropoietin/EPO, without lawful prescriptions and without required labels.  On September 20, 2017, federal agents executed a search warrant at Horsemen's Tack and recovered a customer list, prescription drugs, and numerous vials with labels printed on-site.Stratton is scheduled to be sentenced on December 6, 2018.“When prescription drugs are sold unlawfully, they can end up in the wrong hands or be used for illicit purposes,” said U.S. Attorney Murray.  “We will continue to work closely with the FDA to protect the public by enforcing the laws related to prescription drugs.”“Prescription veterinary drugs should be dispensed only upon a valid prescription by a licensed veterinarian, and it must bear accurate and true information on the labeling,” said Jeffrey J. Ebersole, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ New York Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who attempt to evade the FDA’s protections of animal welfare and jeopardize the health and safety of animals.”This matter was investigated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations.  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney John S.

Africk, the jury unanimously convicted Watts of all four counts.  As the evidence at trial demonstrated, Watts was a co-owner and pharmacist of Doc-Your-Dose Pharmacy in Grosse Tete, Louisiana.  In 2013, Watts organized a scheme to purchase black market HIV pharmaceutical drugs that had been stolen from the Washington, D.C. Department of Health Pharmacy Warehouse intended for indigent HIV patients in Washington, D.C.  Watts sent two of his employees to D.C. on multiple occasions between June and September of 2013 to purchase the stolen medications from various locations including at a local D.C. hotel and fast food chain.  Watts directed his employees to return the black market medications to his Louisiana pharmacy, and once there, Watts dispensed the stolen medication to unsuspecting HIV patients. As a result, Watts profited approximately $600,000.00 by dispensing black market medications as opposed to selling legally-obtained medications.Watts’ criminal conduct became known as the result of a traffic stop near Chattanooga, Tennessee, in which his couriers were stopped for speeding.  During the stop, officers discovered a significant quantity of stolen HIV medications in the trunk of their vehicle. The investigation identified Watts’ criminal conduct along with the conduct of four co-conspirators who were indicted and subsequently pled guilty for their involvement in this scheme. All are awaiting sentencing for their part in this conspiracy.As a result of his convictions, Watts now faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for Count Two, and 15 years for Counts Three and Four, and 5 years for Count One.U.S. Attorney Fremin stated, “Professionals like this defendant who violate federal law and think they can hide in plain view are sadly mistaken. Profiting from stolen meds intended for indigent patients is despicable and will not be tolerated by this office.  The actions of this defendant are a great disservice to the many honest, ethical and law abiding pharmacists and medical professionals in our communities.  I am extremely proud of the efforts of our prosecutors and our federal, state and local law enforcement partners who played a critical role in investigating and prosecuting this complex and important matter.”Attorney General Jeff Landry said, \"I commend my Medicaid Fraud investigators for their diligence and professionalism in this matter which resulted in the conviction of Alvin Watts. Our office and U.S. Attorney Fremin's Office will continue working together to uphold the rule of law.\"“When criminals use fraudulent means, such as theft, to obtain prescription drugs illegally, they place all U.S. consumers at risk,” said Justin D. Green, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Miami Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who put the public health at risk.”This matter is being handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Louisiana, the United States Food And Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, and the Louisiana State Attorney General’s Office’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, with assistance from the State of Tennessee 10th Judicial District Drug & Violent Crime Task Force.  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Peter Smyczek and Paul Pugliese.Topic(s):Prescription DrugsHealth Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - Louisiana, MiddleUnited States Attorney Brandon J.

Connolly, 46, of East Greenwich, R.I., pleaded guilty to 10 counts of mail fraud. U.S. District Court Judge Richard G. Stearns scheduled sentencing for Dec. 19, 2018. In December 2014, Connolly was indicted along with 13 others in connection with the 2012 nationwide fungal meningitis outbreak originating from NECC. Connolly is cooperating with the government and is expected to testify during the October 2018 trial of the remaining NECC defendants.Connolly was a licensed pharmacy technician from September 2007 to January 2009, when he voluntarily surrendered his license in connection with a disciplinary action against him. Under Massachusetts regulations, pharmacy technicians filling drug orders are required to be licensed. Nevertheless, Connolly was hired at NECC and worked as a pharmacy technician from 2010 through October 2012. Connolly was assigned to Clean Room 2 making cardioplegia solutions that are used to stop patients’ hearts during heart surgeries. For more than two years, Connolly produced thousands of cardioplegia solutions that were sent to customers throughout the country. Connolly’s unlicensed status was known to his supervising pharmacists, Barry Cadden, Glenn Chin, and Gene Svirskiy.To mask his presence from regulators, Connolly used Cadden’s username and password to log into the computerized pump so that his name would not appear on any paperwork generated when he filled the cardioplegia orders. He also did not perform any of the required validation tests other pharmacy technicians were required to do. Connolly’s employment file falsely listed him as a warehouse employee.The NECC criminal case arose from the nationwide outbreak of fungal meningitis that was traced back to contaminated vials of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) manufactured by NECC. The outbreak was the largest public health crisis caused by a pharmaceutical product.In March 2017, Cadden was convicted by a federal jury of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud and mislead. He was sentenced in June 2017 to 108 months in prison and three years of supervised release. In October 2017, Chin was convicted of the same charges and sentenced in January 2018 to eight years in prison and two years of supervised release.The charge of mail fraud provides for a sentence of no greater than 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.United States Attorney Andrew E.

Conway, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Chicago Field Office and Special Agent in Charge Lamont Pugh III of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General’s (HHS-OIG) Chicago Regional Office.The Indictment charges the defendants with a conspiracy to commit health care fraud and 17 counts of health care fraud.  The Indictment specifically charges that between 2014 and 2017, the defendants would attend meetings of the United Auto Workers (“UAW”) union.  At those meetings, the defendants touted unnecessary prescription pain cream, scar cream, pain patches and vitamins to UAW members.   The prescriptions were unnecessary because Dr. April Tyler did not establish a valid doctor-patient relationship with any of the UAW members and/or did not determine medical necessity for the prescriptions she wrote for the UAW members.  Many of the compounded pain and scar creams were billed to the insurance company at over $15,000 per prescription.Over the course of the conspiracy, the defendants caused fraudulent claims to be submitted to Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Michigan and/or Express Scripts totaling approximately $9,500,000.  Over the same period, Medicare paid over $800,000 in fraudulent prescription claims.Defendant Patrick Wittbrodt is also charged with seven counts of money laundering in connection with the illegal proceeds of the health care fraud conspiracy.“Health care fraud involving medically necessary prescriptions not only is dangerous to those patients receiving the drugs, but also drives up the cost of health care for everyone,” stated United States Attorney Matthew Schneider.  “This indictment demonstrates that our office is committed to stamping out health care fraud in the Eastern District of Michigan.”“When medical professionals and others scheme to illegally provide unneeded drugs to consumers, they violate the public trust,” said William P. Conway, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Chicago Field Office. “Our office will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who are criminally involved in the distribution of medicines.”“Writing medically unnecessary prescriptions for health care items and products and thus causing them to be billed to federal and private health insurance programs is wrong and illegal” said Lamont Pugh III, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Office of Inspector General.  “Fraudulent acts such as this threaten vitally important programs such as Medicare and the beneficiaries they serve. The OIG will continue to work with our law enforcement and prosecutorial partners to ensure that individuals that perpetuate these types of fraudulent schemes are held accountable.”Health care fraud, conspiracy to commit health care fraud and money laundering are each punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment and/or a $250,000 fine on each count.This case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Michael Heesters and Health Care Fraud Chief Wayne F. Pratt.The case was investigated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.An indictment is only a charge and is not evidence of guilt.  Each defendant is entitled to a fair trial in which it will be the government’s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Topic(s):Health Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - Michigan, Eastern"

Schindele, 43, pleaded guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge David P. Rush to one count of wire fraud and one count of delivering adulterated or misbranded food.Schindele, the owner and operator of Executive Image International, operated a website that sold dietary supplements and drugs to the general public. He worked through businesses owned and operated by co-defendants John G. Schindele, 41 (his brother), and Jennifer S. Travis, 45, both of Nixa, Mo., to sell dietary supplements, which they claimed contained only all-natural ingredients. John Schindele and Travis both pleaded guilty, in separate but related cases, on Feb. 21, 2018.Among the many supplements sold by Michael Schindele was Silver Bullet, marketed as an “all-natural male performance enhancer,” an “Extreme Male Stimulant,” and a “dietary supplement.” In reality, Silver Bullet contained materially different ingredients than what was listed, including sildenafil, a synthetic pharmaceutical ingredient that was not disclosed to consumers purchasing the product.Sildenafil is the active pharmaceutical that is commonly used in the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra. The labeling for Silver Bullet failed to provide adequate warnings about the use of a sildenafil-containing product, which is only legally available with a prescription from a doctor. Michael Schindele was not authorized or licensed to sell this pharmaceutical.Silver Bullet was purchased and shipped from a supplier in the People’s Republic of China, then resold by Michael Schindele and others to consumers throughout the United States and worldwide.Michael Schindele’s misrepresentations resulted in him, Executive Image International, Schindele Enterprises, and Midwest Wholesale obtaining money in the amount of at least $150,000 from consumers.  Michael Schindele, personally, received at least $47,930, which must be forfeited to the government.According to his plea agreement, John Schindele fraudulently received $210,000 for the misrepresented and mislabeled dietary supplements from April 16, 2012, to July 8, 2015. According to her plea agreement, Travis fraudulently received $152,862 for the misrepresented and mislabeled dietary supplements from June 2, 2014, through Jan. 31, 2017.During the time of the fraud scheme, which operated from Oct. 11, 2011, through Jan. 6, 2014, Michael Schindele also pleaded guilty in a separate and unrelated case to the misdemeanor offense of introducing an unapproved animal drug. Schindele admitted that he sold heartworm tablets that were produced in Australia and had not been approved for sale in the United States, and which required a veterinarian’s prescription. Federal agents seized 1,368 doses of the heartworm tablets from Schindele’s EZBody store in Springfield. Schindele was sentenced on July 17, 2012, to one year of unsupervised probation.Under federal statutes, Michael Schindele is subject to a sentence of up to 23 years in federal prison without parole. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes, as the sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the court based on the advisory sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the United States Probation Office.These cases are being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nhan D.

Jackson, Special Agent in Charge for the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  “We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners by investigating allegations where the health and safety of Medicare beneficiaries are at risk.”“American consumers expect and deserve that the devices used by their health care practitioners during medical procedures are not only safe and effective, but also have been held under sanitary conditions,” said Peter Kuehl, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations’ Miami Field Office.  “FDA remains fully committed to working with the Department of Justice and our law enforcement partners to hold those who place profits before the health and safety of patients fully accountable.”“This settlement demonstrates the Government’s commitment to protect public funds that support the operations of our armed forces healthcare program (TRICARE) from fraud and abuse,” said John F.

Brady announced today.United States District Judge Cathy Bissoon sentenced each of the defendants - Tony Lee, 41, of Vancouver, BC, Billy Lee, 43, of White Rock, BC, and Tarnjeet Uppal, 37, of Surray, BC, - to three years probation and a fine of $55,000. Judge Bissoon sentenced their company, Quantum Solutions, SRL, to a $150,000 fine and ordered it to forfeit of $4,235,000.According to the information presented to the court, Tony Lee, Billy Lee and Tarn Uppal, all Vancouver, B.C. residents, operated Quantum Solutions, SRL (hereafter, Quantum), a company registered in Barbados. Quantum purchased prescription drugs made for foreign markets and sold wholesale quantities to three pharmacists in western Pennsylvania. Quantum purchased the drugs from suppliers located in Turkey, Great Britain and other countries. The defendants arranged for these misbranded drugs to be sent to a re-shipper in the United Kingdom (UK). The UK re-shipper was instructed to unpack the drugs, repack them in several small packages, put misleading labeling and shipping documentation on them and understate the dollar value of the contents in order to create the appearance to U.S. Customs and Border Protection that the drugs were health care products for the personal use of the addressee. The small packages were sent to Washington State and New York State re-shippers known to the U.S. Attorney, where they were once again unpacked and repacked for delivery in the United States. Wholesale quantities of these misbranded drugs intended for use in foreign markets were purchased by three pharmacists in western Pennsylvania. The wire transfers, checks and credit card payments from the pharmacists traveled from western Pennsylvania to Canada and Barbados. None of the re-shippers was licensed in the United States to conduct this business. None of the prescription drugs met FDA approval because they were made and labeled for use outside of the United States.\"Distributing prescription drugs produced and labeled for use outside of the United States within our borders not only violates federal law but also threatens the health and safety of our citizens,\" said U.S. Attorney Brady. \"We are committed to investigating and prosecuting any drug company that illegally circumvents the regulated process for the distribution of prescription drugs.\"\"Criminals who distribute misbranded prescription drugs from outside the U.S. supply chain put the health of all U.S. consumers at risk,\" said Mark S. McCormack, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Field Office. \"Our skilled cybercrime investigators will continue to disrupt and dismantle illegal prescription drug distribution networks.\"\"The role of IRS-Criminal Investigation in a case like this is to follow the money, which in turn allows us to disrupt and dismantle the organization\", said Guy Ficco, Special Agent in Charge of IRS-Criminal Investigation. \"The defendants who perpetrated this scheme put the American public at risk.

McCleary, 30, waived his right to a grand jury and pleaded guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge David P. Rush to a federal information that charges him with two counts of tampering with a consumer product.McCleary worked at several health care facilities as an emergency medical technician (EMT) between Sept. 25, 2015, and Feb. 21, 2018. During this time, McCleary worked for the Grove, Okla., Emergency Medical Service as an EMT, as a paramedic for Cox Health in Springfield, as a paramedic for Mercy Health in Carthage, Mo., and as a paramedic with Barton County, Mo., Emergency Medical Service.According to today’s plea agreement, 18 separate adverse event reports were filed by individuals who received emergency medical services from Barton County EMS. In each of those reports, individuals advised that various opioid drugs were administered to provide pain relief, but due to McCleary’s theft of the drugs, and tampering by replacing the drugs with saline solution, each of these individuals did not receive the pain relief intended and experienced continued pain that resulted from McCleary’s reckless disregard to risk of serious bodily injury and harm to these patients.In February 2018, agents with the Food and Drug Administration-Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI) opened an investigation regarding the repeated theft and dilution of opioid drugs from various health care providers throughout southwest Missouri. Agents learned that while McCleary was employed as either an EMT or paramedic, various vials containing opioid-based drugs, including fentanyl, morphine, hydrocodone and ketamine, were stolen.  Medical service officials advised agents that in some instances the vials were stolen and in other instances, the vials were tampered with so that the drugs were removed and saline was injected to the vials to make it appear that the drugs had not been stolen.McCleary specifically pleaded guilty to tampering with vials that contained fentanyl and morphine sulfate, by removing those drugs from their vials and replacing them with saline solution, while working for Barton County Emergency Medical Service between Jan. 20 and Feb. 21, 2018. McCleary also specifically pleaded guilty to tampering with vials that contained fentanyl and morphine sulfate, by removing those drugs from their vials and replacing them with saline solution, while working for Cox Health from April 1 to May 19, 2017.Under federal statutes, McCleary is subject to a sentence of up to 10 years in federal prison without parole. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes, as the sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the court based on the advisory sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the United States Probation Office.This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Carney.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseJuly 18, 2018United States Department of JusticeWASHINGTON – Latham, New York-based medical device manufacturer AngioDynamics, Inc. has agreed to pay the United States a total of $12.5 million to resolve allegations that the company caused healthcare providers to submit false claims to Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs relating to the use of two medical devices, LC Bead and the Perforator Vein Ablation Kit (PVAK), the Justice Department announced today.“The Justice Department is committed to holding medical device manufacturers accountable, which includes requiring that they follow all laws designed to ensure that medical devices are safe and effective,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Chad A. Readler for the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “When manufacturers make misleading statements concerning the use of their products in ways that have not been cleared by the FDA, it undermines patient care. Taxpayers and patients deserve better.”AngioDynamics will pay $11.5 million to resolve allegations that the company caused false claims to be submitted to government healthcare programs for procedures involving an unapproved drug-delivery device that was marketed with false and misleading promotional claims. The government alleged that, from May 2006 through December 2011, AngioDynamics served as the U.S. distributor for Biocompatibles plc, the manufacturer of LC Bead, and marketed LC Bead for use as a drug-delivery device in combination with chemotherapy drugs. Moreover, AngioDynamics personnel routinely claimed that this particular use of LC Bead, which FDA had twice declined to approve, was “better”, “superior”, “safer” and “less toxic” than alternative treatments, even though there was insufficient clinical evidence to support the truthfulness of these claims. The government also alleged that AngioDynamics was aware that many insurers declined to provide coverage for certain LC Bead procedures and, as a result, instructed healthcare providers to use inaccurate billing codes when submitting claims for such uses.  The federal share of the civil settlement is approximately $10.9 million, and the state Medicaid share of the civil settlement is approximately $600,000. The government previously resolved related criminal and civil claims against Biocompatibles in November 2016.“The basic legal rule in this area could be mastered by a third-grader:  Don’t lie,” said U.S. Attorney John F. Bash for the Western District of Texas.  “If you do, you will be held accountable. This settlement reflects that.”AngioDynamics will separately pay $1 million to resolve allegations that the company caused false claims to be submitted to federal healthcare programs in connection with the use of the PVAK, later renamed the 400 micron kit. In 2008, AngioDynamics acquired the PVAK as part of a product suite that utilizes a laser to close or collapse malfunctioning veins. The PVAK was FDA-cleared only for use in treating superficial veins, and, in 2011, AngioDynamics requested that the FDA clearance include the treatment of perforator veins. However, FDA informed the company that the treatment of perforator veins constitutes a new indication for which safety and efficacy were unknown. As a result, AngioDynamics voluntarily recalled the PVAK and re-issued the product under a new name, the 400 micron kit that did not refer to the unapproved use of treating perforator veins. Notwithstanding the recall and rebranding, certain AngioDynamics personnel, as part of a continued campaign to market the device to treat perforator veins, falsely represented to providers that Medicare would cover this use despite Medicare coverage restrictions to the contrary.“This settlement reflects the expectation that medical device manufacturers will give doctors accurate information about devices they manufacture and underscores the vital role of the False Claims Act in protecting the public fisc,” said United States Attorney Grant C. Jaquith for the Northern District of New York. “We will continue to use all available tools to help secure patient safety and ensure the integrity of healthcare services claims submitted to the government.”“Medical device makers have an obligation to provide truthful information to protect both patients and the integrity of government health programs,” said Special Agent in Charge Scott J. Lampert of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department Office of Inspector General.  “We will continue to thoroughly investigate health care fraud allegations.”The civil settlement relating to LC Bead resolves a lawsuit filed under the whistleblower provision of the False Claims Act by Mr. Ryan Bliss, who formerly worked in the marketing departments of both AngioDynamics and Biocompatibles. The Act permits private parties to file suit on behalf of the United States for false claims and share in a portion of the government’s recovery.  The civil lawsuit was filed in the Western District of Texas and is captionedUnited States ex rel. Ryan Bliss v. Biocompatibles, Inc., et al., Case No. SA-13-CA-0667-XR. As part of today’s resolution, Mr. Bliss will receive approximately $2.3 million from the settlement relating to LC Bead.The settlements with AngioDynamics were the result of a coordinated effort among the U.S. Attorney’s Offices for the Western District of Texas and the Northern District of New York and the Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch, with assistance from the FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel, HHS’ Office of Counsel to the Inspector General, and the Department of Defense’s Defense Criminal Investigative Service. The investigations were conducted by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations; the HHS Office of Inspector General investigated allegations in the settlement involving PVAK.The claims resolved by the civil settlements are allegations only, and there have been no determinations of liability.Topic(s):False Claims ActComponent(s):Civil DivisionUSAO - New York, NorthernUSAO - Texas, WesternPress Release Number:18-947"

(“Cumberland”) and was convicted by a jury in February, after a week-long trial, of 15 counts of mail fraud, conspiracy and making a false statement to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration.  Charles and Brenda Edwards previously pleaded guilty to related charges.  Charles Edwards was also sentenced today to six years in prison and ordered to forfeit $1.4 million.  Brenda Edwards will be sentenced later this year.The evidence at trial established that, from December 2006 through August 2009, Smith and Jeff Edwards purchased millions of dollars of prescription drugs from unlicensed suppliers who had previously purchased the drugs from patients in and around New York and Miami.  In most instances, Smith had these drugs shipped to Cumberland’s Nashville warehouse where they were cleaned, sorted, re-packaged, and shipped to independent pharmacies around the country.  Generally, the diverted drugs included drugs used to combat HIV/AIDS; antipsychotic medications; anti-depressants; blood pressure medications; diabetes medications and others.Smith and Jeff Edwards also had drugs shipped from their unlicensed suppliers to shell companies in Louisiana and Arkansas.  Although these companies were licensed to sell drugs, Smith and Jeff Edwards used them as pass-through companies to create the appearance that Cumberland was purchasing drugs from licensed suppliers, when, in fact, Cumberland was purchasing diverted drugs from un-licensed suppliers in New York and Miami.  The drugs arriving at Smith’s shell companies were forwarded to Cumberland’s Nashville warehouse and re-sold to independent pharmacies.In order to conceal the drugs’ true origins, Smith and his co-conspirators provided false documentation to Cumberland’s pharmacy customers.Numerous pharmacies reported problems with drugs they purchased from Cumberland, including prescription drug bottles containing the wrong medicine; the wrong dosage information; and foreign objects inside.  At trial, several witnesses testified that at least one bottle of prescription drugs sold by Cumberland contained breath fresheners instead of medicine.On May 14, 2009, the FDA executed a federal search warrant at Cumberland’s Nashville warehouse.  Thereafter, in order to evade authorities, Smith and his co-conspirators rented another warehouse, utilized freight forwarding companies to receive drug shipments, set up private email accounts, purchased burner phones and hired a private pilot to fly drugs to Nashville.  Their scheme resulted in gross proceeds of over $50 million.This case was investigated by the United States Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigation.  It is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Henry C.

Vint, Acting Inspector General, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Office of Inspector General (OPM-OIG); and Dennis Russo, Director of Operations, National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB),announced that in the Southern District of Florida a total of 124 defendants were charged with offenses relating to their alleged participation in various fraud schemes involving over $337 million in false billings for services including home health care, substance abuse treatment, lab testing, and pharmacy fraud.The South Florida charges are part of the largest ever national health care fraud enforcement action by the Medicare Fraud Strike Force.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced today that more than 601 defendants were charged, across 58 federal districts, including 76 doctors, as well as nurses and other licensed medical professionals, for their alleged participation in health care fraud schemes involving approximately $2 billion in false billings. Of those charged, over 162 defendants, including doctors, were charged for their roles in prescribing and distributing opioids and other dangerous narcotics. Thirty state Medicaid Fraud Control Units also participated in today’s arrests.  In addition, HHS announced today that fromJuly 2017 to the present,it has excluded 2,700 individuals from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and all other Federal health care programs, which includes587 providers excluded for conduct related to opioid diversion and abuse.The charges announced today aggressively target schemes billing Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE (a health insurance program for members and veterans of the armed forces and their families), and private insurance companies for medically unnecessary prescription drugs and compounded medications that often were never even purchased and/or distributed to beneficiaries. The charges also involve individuals contributing to the opioid epidemic, with a particular focus on medical professionals involved in the unlawful distribution of opioids and other prescription narcotics, a particular focus for the Department of Justice (DOJ). According to the CDC, approximately 115 Americans die every day of an opioid-related overdose.According to court documents, the defendants allegedly participated in schemes to submit claims to Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and private insurance companies for treatments that were medically unnecessary and often never provided. In many cases, patient recruiters, beneficiaries and other co-conspirators were allegedly paid cash kickbacks in return for supplying beneficiary information to providers, so that the providers could then submit fraudulent bills to Medicare for services that were medically unnecessary or never performed.Collectively, the doctors, nurses, licensed medical professionals, health care company owners and others charged are accused of submitting a total of over $2 billion in fraudulent billings.The number of medical professionals charged is particularly significant, because virtually every health care fraud scheme requires a corrupt medical professional to be involved in order for Medicare or Medicaid to pay the fraudulent claims.  Aggressively pursuing corrupt medical professionals not only has a deterrent effect on other medical professionals, but also ensures that their licenses can no longer be used to bilk the system.“Today’s takedown sends a clear message that those who steal our tax dollars and divert money from much needed government programs to line their own pockets will be brought to justice,” stated U.S. Attorney Benjamin Greenberg.  The same is true of those individuals who facilitate these crimes by enabling the perpetrators to financially benefit from their misdeeds.  The South Florida based schemes involved hundreds of millions of dollars in fraud, and in some cases resulted in significant harm to patients in need of substance abuse treatment. When that treatment is withheld because of someone’s greed, the very people who are supposed to help the addicts end up enabling their addiction.  Side by side with our great partners, we will continue to fight against all forms of healthcare fraud in South Florida.”“Health care fraud and opioid abuse are threats to this country, both in terms of the well-being of patients and the viability of government health care programs,” said Shimon R. Richmond, Special Agent in Charge, HHS-OIG.  “This takedown sends a clear message that criminals who engage in health care fraud schemes and illicit opioid distribution will be caught.  Working collaboratively with our state and federal partners, we will continue to bring these criminals to justice.”John F. Khin, Special Agent in Charge, DCIS-Southeast Field Office, stated, “As part of the National Health Care Fraud multi-agency joint effort, the DCIS-Southeast Field Office contributed significant resources and efforts to achieve a successful operation to effectively combat widespread fraud and abuse, and preserve the integrity of TRICARE, a vital DoD program serving U.S. service members, retirees, and their families.”“Health care fraud costs taxpayers billions of dollars, increases medical costs and even helps fuel the national opioid crisis,” stated Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.  “Our law enforcement partners and my Medicaid Fraud Control Unit aggressively investigate fraud in Florida, and as part of this massive nationwide effort, we were able to arrest some of the worst offenders and stop the illegal sale of prescription opioids—and hopefully safe lives.”“Today’s local announcement reinforces law enforcement’s continued commitment to combat healthcare fraud in South Florida. IRS-CI is proud toparticipate in these casesand be part of theGreater Palm Beach County Health Care Fraud Task Force where we can provide our expertise to conduct financial analysis andunravel the complex financial transactions involved in these fraudulent schemes. IRS-CI will continue to allocate resources to fight the battle against healthcare fraud and will investigate individuals who are committing crimes while motivated by greed,” statedMichael J. DePalma, Acting Special Agent in Charge, IRS-CI.“This historic announcement marks a significant effort by the National Healthcare Fraud Takedown task force and should send a clear message that these crimes will not be tolerated,” said Special Agent in Charge, Christopher Cave, USPS OIG.  “The USPS Office of Inspector General, along with our law enforcement partners, will continue to aggressively pursue these investigations in order to ensure continued oversight and protection ofthe Postal Serviceand federal benefits programs.”“We applaud the coordinated efforts of our federal law enforcement partners in this action today.  The FDA is proud to play a role in supporting these investigations,” said U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “A key aspect of the FDA’s mission to protect public health is creating a regulatory framework that helps ensure that compounded drugs are dispensed to patients who have a legitimate medical need for them.”“Insurance fraud has seeped into our opioid treatment homes in Florida, impacting countless families and communities,” said CFO Jimmy Patronis. “The collaborative efforts of national, state and local law enforcement are essential for combatting this type of activity. My office, along with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida and our law enforcement partners remains committed to safeguarding Floridians while reminding those who seek to deceive and defraud – they will be held accountable for their actions.”“These cases reinforce our commitment and determination to pursue those who would defraud Amtrak’s health care programs and target such vulnerable populations,” said Amtrak Inspector General Tom Howard. “Our agents will continue to hold perpetrators accountable and to protect Amtrak, its employees and their dependents.”“Today’s announcement is a reflection of federal, state, and local partners joining forces to root out fraud and abuse in the healthcare system,” said Atlanta Regional Director for DOL-EBSA Isabel Colon. “The department will continue to take all actions necessary to put a stop to those who would defraud workers and their families of hard-earned employee benefits.”“The OPM-OIG will continue to work with the Department of Justice and our other law enforcement partners to protect the integrity of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program and ensure that Federal employees, annuitants, and their families receive unbiased medical care from ethical professionals,” said Norbert E. Vint, Acting OPM Inspector General.The following are some of the recent health care fraud cases that have been charged in the Southern District of Florida:I.SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT FRAUD AND ILLEGAL DISTRIBUTION OF OPIOIDSThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida continues to partner with federal, state and local law enforcement agencies and the Greater Palm Beach Health Care Fraud Task Force(“Task Force”) to target fraud and other criminal practices in the substance abuse treatment/medical industry, including: money laundering; billing for treatment and laboratory testing that was not actually provided and not medically necessary; submission of claims that were solicited through the payment of kickbacks and bribes to patients, sober home owners, and treatment center owners; and the illegal distribution of opioids.To date, at least 34 individuals have been charged federally, 19 have been convicted, $20,292,916.37 in restitution has been ordered, and more than $4 million in restitution has been collected.A.Health Care Fraud and Money Laundering1.United States v.

Burroughs to two years of probation. In December 2017, Green pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances. Brian Petzke, 49, was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton to two years in prison and two years of supervised release. In February 2018, Petzke pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances. Petzke and six others, including Green’s sister, were charged in April 2017 for their roles in the conspiracy. Green was later charged by Information.From approximately May 2015 until April 12, 2017, the conspirators manufactured steroid products made from raw materials that they purchased overseas and marketed as “Onyx” steroids using “Onyx” labels that were also ordered from overseas suppliers. Onyx, now owned by Amgen Inc., is a legitimate pharmaceutical company that does not manufacture steroids.The defendants sold the steroids to customers across the United States using email and social media platforms, collected payment through money remitters, such as Western Union and MoneyGram, and used false identifications and multiple remitter locations to pick up the proceeds. Some of the defendants laundered proceeds from the steroid sales through Wicked Tan LLC, a tanning business in Beverly, which they owned and operated specifically to launder the proceeds of the steroid operation.Green’s role in the conspiracy was to collect customer payments from money remitters using false identifications and provide those proceeds to another member of the organization. Green retrieved more than $220,000 in customer payments for steroid purchases.Petzke’s principal roles in the conspiracy were receiving packages containing raw steroid powder; shipping steroids to customers throughout the United States at the direction of co-defendants Tyler Baumann and Phillip Goodwin; and picking up steroid proceeds from money remitters at the direction of Baumann and Goodwin.Baumann and Goodwin each pleaded guilty and were sentenced in March 2018 to 10 years and 130 months in prison, respectively.United States Attorney Andrew E.

        "content": "Department of JusticeU.S. Attorney’s OfficeNorthern District of CaliforniaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFriday, June 15, 2018Elizabeth Holmes and Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani Are Alleged to Have Perpetrated Multi-million Dollar Schemes to Defraud Investors, Doctors, and PatientsSAN JOSE - A federal grand jury has indicted Elizabeth A. Holmes and Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, announced Acting United States Attorney Alex G. Tse, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agent in Charge John F. Bennett; Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb; and U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) Inspector in Charge Rafael Nuñez.  The defendants are charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine counts of wire fraud.  According to the indictment returned yesterday and unsealed today, the charges stem from allegations Holmes and Balwani engaged in a multi-million dollar scheme to defraud investors, and a separate scheme to defraud doctors and patients.  Both schemes involved efforts to promote Palo Alto, Calif.-based Theranos.Holmes, 34, of Los Altos Hills, Calif., founded Theranos in 2003.  Theranos is a private health care and life sciences company with the stated mission to revolutionize medical laboratory testing through allegedly innovative methods for drawing blood, testing blood, and interpreting the resulting patient data.  Balwani, 53, of Atherton, Calif., was employed at Theranos from September of 2009 through 2016.  At times during that period, Balwani worked in several capacities including as a member of the company’s board of directors, as its president, and as its chief operating officer.According to the indictment, Holmes and Balwani used advertisements and solicitations to encourage and induce doctors and patients to use Theranos’s blood testing laboratory services, even though the defendants knew Theranos was not capable of consistently producing accurate and reliable results for certain blood tests.  The tests performed on Theranos technology, in addition, were likely to contain inaccurate and unreliable results.The indictment alleges that the defendants used a combination of direct communications, marketing materials, statements to the media, financial statements, models, and other information to defraud potential investors.  Specifically, the defendants claimed that Theranos developed a revolutionary and proprietary analyzer that the defendants referred to by various names, including as the TSPU, Edison, or minilab.  The defendants claimed the analyzer was able to perform a full range of clinical tests using small blood samples drawn from a finger stick.  The defendants also represented that the analyzer could produce results that were more accurate and reliable than those yielded by conventional methods—all at a faster speed than previously possible.The indictment further alleges that Holmes and Balwani knew that many of their representations about the analyzer were false.  For example, allegedly, Holmes and Balwani knew that the analyzer, in truth, had accuracy and reliability problems, performed a limited number of tests, was slower than some competing devices, and, in some respects, could not compete with existing, more conventional machines.“This district, led by Silicon Valley, is at the center of modern technological innovation and entrepreneurial spirit; capital investment makes that possible.  Investors large and small from around the world are attracted to Silicon Valley by its track record, its talent, and its promise.  They are also attracted by the fact that behind the innovation and entrepreneurship are rules of law that require honesty, fair play, and transparency.  This office, along with our other law enforcement partners in the Bay Area, will vigorously investigate and prosecute those who do not play by the rules that make Silicon Valley work.  Today’s indictment alleges that through their company, Theranos, CEO Elizabeth Holmes and COO Sunny Balwani not only defrauded investors, but also consumers who trusted and relied upon their allegedly-revolutionary blood-testing technology.”“This indictment alleges a corporate conspiracy to defraud financial investors,” said Special Agent in Charge Bennett.  “This conspiracy misled doctors and patients about the reliability of medical tests that endangered health and lives.”“The conduct alleged in these charges erodes public trust in the safety and effectiveness of medical products, including diagnostics. The FDA would like to extend our thanks to our federal law enforcement partners for sending a strong message to Theranos executives and others that these types of actions will not be tolerated,” said Catherine A. Hermsen, Acting Director, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations.“The United States Postal Inspection Service has a long history of successfully investigating complex fraud cases,” said Inspector in Charge Rafael E. Nuñez.  “Anyone who engages in deceptive practices should know they will not go undetected and will be held accountable.  The collaborative investigative work on this case conducted by Postal Inspectors, our law enforcement partners, and the United States Attorney’s Office illustrates our efforts to protect both consumers and investors.”The Indictment Alleges That Doctors And Patients Were DefraudedThe indictment alleges Holmes and Balwani defrauded doctors and patients by making false claims concerning Theranos’s ability to provide accurate, fast, reliable, and cheap blood tests and test results, and through omissions concerning the limits of and problems with Theranos’s technologies.  The defendants knew Theranos was not capable of consistently producing accurate and reliable results for certain blood tests, including the tests for calcium, chloride, potassium, bicarbonate, HIV, Hba1C, hCG, and sodium.  The defendants nevertheless used interstate electronic wires to purchase advertisements intended to induce individuals to purchase Theranos blood tests at Walgreens stores in California and Arizona.  Through these advertisements, the defendants explicitly represented to individuals that Theranos’s blood tests were cheaper than blood tests from conventional laboratories to induce individuals to purchase Theranos’s blood tests.Further, the indictment alleges that based on the defendants’ misrepresentations and omissions, many hundreds of patients paid, or caused their medical insurance companies to pay, Theranos, or Walgreens acting on behalf of Theranos, for blood tests and test results, sometimes following referrals from their defrauded doctors.  In addition, the defendants delivered to doctors and patients blood results that were inaccurate, unreliable, and improperly validated.  The defendants also delivered to doctors and patients blood test results from which critical results were improperly removed.The indictment describes a number of schemes that defendants allegedly employed to mislead investors, doctors, and patients.  For example, with respect to investors, defendants performed technology demonstrations during which defendants intended to cause potential investors to believe blood tests were being conducted on Theranos’s proprietary analyzer when, in fact, the analyzer really was running a “null protocol”  and was not testing the potential investor’s blood.  Similarly, defendants purchased and used commercially-available analyzers to test patient blood, while representing to investors that Theranos conducted its patients’ tests using Theranos-manufactured analyzers.The Indictment Alleges That Investors Were DefraudedAccording to the indictment, the defendants also allegedly made numerous misrepresentations to potential investors about Theranos’s financial condition and its future prospects.  For example, the defendants represented to investors that Theranos conducted its patients’ tests using Theranos-manufactured analyzers; when, in truth, Holmes and Balwani knew that Theranos purchased and used for patient testing third party, commercially-available analyzers.  The defendants also represented to investors that Theranos would generate over $100 million in revenues and break even in 2014 and that Theranos expected to generate approximately $1 billion in revenues in 2015 when, in truth, the defendants knew Theranos would generate only negligible or modest revenues in 2014 and 2015.Further, defendants allegedly represented to investors that Theranos had a profitable and revenue-generating business relationship with the United States Department of Defense and that Theranos’s technology had deployed to the battlefield when, in truth, Theranos had limited revenue from military contracts and its technology was not deployed in the battlefield.  In addition, the defendants represented to investors that Theranos would soon dramatically increase the number of Wellness Centers within Walgreens stores when, in truth, Holmes and Balwani knew by late 2014 that Theranos’s retail Walgreens rollout had stalled because of several issues, including that Walgreens’s executives had concerns with Theranos’s performance.An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.The indictment charges each defendant with two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349, and nine counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343.  If convicted, the defendants face a maximum sentence of twenty (20) years in prison, and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution, for each count of wire fraud and for each conspiracy count.  However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. § 3553.Both defendants appeared today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Susan van Keulen for their initial appearances.  The matter was assigned to the Honorable Lucy H. Koh, U.S. District Judge, for further proceedings.Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jeff Schenk, Robert S. Leach, and John C. Bostic are prosecuting the case with the assistance of Laurie Worthen and Bridget Kilkenny.  The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, the FBI, and the US Postal Inspection Service.Attachment(s):Download balwani_holmes_indictment.pdfTopic(s):Financial FraudComponent(s):USAO - California, Northern"

Hayes. RANDY SPARKS, 60, admits he purchased various food and drink products from a middleman who had agreed to destroy the goods. SPARKS then resold the products from his own grocery outlet, Silver Dollar Sales, or sold them to other discount grocery chains. The investigation did not uncover any illnesses resulting from the sales. The Court will determine any restitution owed to the victims, up to an amount of $103,709 at the time of sentencing, currently set before U.S. District Judge Robert S. Lasnik on September 7, 2018.According to records filed in the case, the scheme involved as many as 180 truckloads of food and beverage products from ten different food producers. The plea agreement details how SPARKS and a co-conspirator defrauded a Massachusetts-based company that arranged for the disposal and destruction of unsaleable food products. Specifically between July 2014 and October 2016, SPARKS and a co-conspirator represented that the commodities would be shipped to a South Dakota based business for destruction. The co-schemers produced fraudulent paperwork regarding the shipping and destruction of the goods. In fact, they were shipped to SPARKS who then sold them from his own grocery outlet or to other discount grocery chains.The plea agreement describes how in May 2015, a juice producer in Selah, Washington, wanted 22 truckloads of apple juice destroyed because it did not meet their production standards. The producer arranged for the juice to be shipped to South Dakota to be recycled into animal feed. Instead, SPARKS shipped the juice through Seattle to Mississippi, and then sold it to outlets in Mississippi and California. The conspirators then presented the brokerage company with false documents about the destruction of the juice and the shipping history, which were ultimately provided to the manufacturer. The scheme was uncovered when some of the product was discovered on a store shelf in Maryland.Approximately ten producers of food and beverage products had paid a combined $107,256 to have their products destroyed, which, in fact, were not destroyed, but instead resold to or by SPARKS.The case was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Matthew Diggs.Topic(s):Consumer ProtectionComponent(s):USAO - Washington, WesternContact:Press contact for the U.S. Attorney’s Office is Public Affairs Officer Emily Langlie at (206) 553-4110 or Emily.Langlie@usdoj.gov."

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseApril 13, 2018United States Department of JusticeDistrict of MontanaMissoula -- Kristjan Thorkelson, a resident of Manitoba, Canada, together with several Canadian companies associated with Thorkelson, including Canada Drugs, Rockley Ventures, and River East Supplies, admitted today to widespread illegal sales of misbranded and counterfeit prescription drugs in the United States. Chief U.S. District Court Judge Dana Christensen sentenced the Canadian companies to forfeit $29,000,000 of the proceeds of their illegal scheme, to pay a fine of $5,000,000, and to five years of probation. The court sentenced Thorkelson individually to pay a fine of $250,000 and to five years of probation with the first six months in home confinement. Thorkelson and the associated companies were also ordered to permanently cease their illegal operations, surrender to the United States all domain names and websites from their businesses, and cooperate with the United States Justice Department and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in any further criminal investigations.In 2010, it came to the attention of the FDA that Canada Drugs was shipping to health care providers in the United States prescription drugs that were unapproved in the United States, labelled with foreign languages, and that lacked adequate instructions for use.  During this time, Thorkelson was CEO of Canada Drugs. Further investigation revealed that various entities affiliated with Canada Drugs were smuggling unapproved and misbranded drugs intended for sale in foreign countries into the United States, including for sale to providers in Montana. To facilitate its sales, Canada Drugs purchased other companies engaged in this business and used the brand names, drug inventories, and customer lists of those companies to further its illegal operations. One of those companies was Montana HealthCare Solutions, owned by Montana resident Paul Bottomley, who was separately prosecuted for similar conduct. In order to avoid detection, Canada Drugs and its affiliated companies falsified customs forms concerning the value of the drugs shipped into the United States.In two instances, Canada Drugs, through its subsidiary River East Supplies, distributed counterfeit cancer drugs Avastin and Altuzan (the Turkish version of the drug) in the United States. Testing of vials of the drugs recovered from these shipments revealed that both contained no active ingredient. In 2012, Thorkelson and others at Canada Drugs became aware that they had shipped counterfeit Avastin and Altuzan to medical clinics in the United States. Thorkelson denied “selling or offering Avastin,” even while the company attempted to recall the suspect drugs. At no time did Thorkelson notify the FDA or other authorities in the United States that counterfeit cancer drugs containing no active ingredient had been shipped to providers in the United States.United States Attorney Kurt Alme stated, “By circumventing the FDA approval process, Thorkelson and the Canada Drugs companies jeopardized the health and safety of Americans. The FDA approval process is important for the protection of public health and safety, and we will diligently prosecute those who put unknown and unapproved substances into the American prescription drug market. But as this case shows, American providers and consumers need to beware when purchasing drugs on the internet.”“FDA regulations are in place to protect patients and help ensure the medicines they receive are safe and effective,” said Catherine A. Hermsen, acting director of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations. “The U.S. drug supply is among the safest in the world, but when drugs from outside the FDA’s closed supply chain enter the U.S., patients are put at risk. For the protection of consumers, the FDA will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who attempt to evade FDA’s regulations.”The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Chad Spraker and Special Assistant United States Attorney Paul Joseph, and investigated by the U.S. FDA Office of Criminal Investigations. The Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs also provided significant assistance in this matter. The Department also thanks its law enforcement colleagues in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Barbados.Topic(s):Prescription DrugsComponent(s):Criminal DivisionUSAO - MontanaContact:KERI LEGGETT Acting Public Information Officer (406) 761-7715"

Mark Zhang), of Shanghai, China, pleaded guilty in Dallas to committing mail fraud in connection with a scheme to sell mislabeled dietary supplements, the Department of Justice announced today.Zhang was the sales manager for Genabolix USA Inc. and Shanghai Yongyi Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Chinese firms that sell raw ingredients for use in dietary supplements. In pleading guilty, Zhang admitted that he agreed to help sell synthetic stimulant ingredients, including the substance known as 1,4-DMAA, to a purported dietary supplement manufacturer in the United States. According to an indictment returned in October 2017, Zhang and two co-defendants agreed with a confidential government informant to either mislabel the synthetic ingredients or otherwise help to hide the true nature of a proposed dietary supplement from retailers. Zhang admitted that he knew major American dietary supplement retailers would refuse to carry supplements known to contain certain stimulants, such as DMAA.“Americans should be able to trust the products they consume are safe,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Chad A. Readler of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “We will continue to investigate and prosecute those who enable the sale of mislabeled and potentially unsafe dietary supplements.”Zhang pleaded guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge David Horan of the Northern District of Texas. He faces a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years of imprisonment. The Court set sentencing for Oct. 15.“U.S. consumers trust that their dietary supplements are safe and contain appropriate labeling. When unscrupulous producers add undeclared or misidentified ingredients to dietary supplements, there is no assurance that the product is safe for consumption,” said Catherine A. Hermsen, Acting Director, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations. “The FDA will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who participate in fraudulently marketing dietary supplements to the detriment of public health.”Zhang was arrested in September 2017 along with a co-defendant, Gao Mei Fang, while attending a dietary supplement trade show in Las Vegas. Gao pleaded guilty on April 3, 2018.

Murray announced that John Hayes, 53, and his wife, Plabpleung Hayes, 50, of New Ipswich were sentenced today for participating in a scheme to distribute misbranded prescription drugs that they obtained from India.John Hayes was sentenced to serve 30 months in prison and to pay a $2,500 fine.  Plabpleung Hayes was sentenced to serve a year and a day in prison.  Both previously pleaded guilty to participating in a conspiracy to distribute misbranded prescription drugs into interstate commerce.  Plabpleung Hayes faces possible deportation to Thailand following the completion of her sentence.According to court documents and statements in court, the defendants conspired with others, including John Hayes’ brother (James Hayes) and sister-in-law (Shannon Hayes) in North Carolina, to receive shipments of pills from India.  During the course of the conspiracy, John and Plabpleung Hayes, along with their co-conspirators in North Carolina, received over 2.4 million prescription drugs from India, many of which were controlled substances.  The defendants attempted to conceal their scheme by having the drugs shipped to numerous Post Office boxes, including boxes in southern New Hampshire and northern Massachusetts.In addition, United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seized more than 60 shipments from India destined for locations controlled by John Hayes that were found to contain more than 100,000 additional pills.  The pills were packaged in blister packs, with no packaging that a person would recognize as retail-type packaging, and with no directions for use.  CBP sent numerous letters to John Hayes advising him that the seizures occurred because the drugs were imported contrary to federal regulations that prohibit the importation of controlled substances without the express authorization of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).The defendants sent more than 5,000 packages to locations throughout the United States, including outside of New Hampshire, between February 2012 and September 2013.  The defendants used an email account to manage and confirm the receipt of drugs from India, to receive and track customer orders for drugs, and to coordinate payments.When a search warrant was executed at the Hayes residence in New Ipswich, investigators found more than 100,000 pills, including prescription drugs and controlled substances, as well as shipping labels, empty shipping containers, and other documents.  Among those documents were two letters from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) informing John Hayes that Tramadol tablets shipped to him were being refused entry into the United States because the drugs appeared to be unapproved and misbranded.The drugs distributed by the defendants were not approved by the FDA and included foreign versions of Hydrocodone, Percocet, Valium, Xanax, Adderall, Ritalin, Ativan, Ambien, Tramadol, Soma, Sildenafil, and Tadalafil.James Hayes, Shannon Hayes, and two additional co-conspirators were convicted of related charges in North Carolina.“Misbranded drugs present a danger to the public,” said U.S. Attorney Murray.  “The millions of pills that the defendants were distributing were not approved by the FDA and had the potential to harm, rather than heal, those who took them.  The defendants placed their interests in profits over patient safety.  I commend the law enforcement agents whose hard work dismantled this criminal scheme.”“The FDA's requirements are designed to ensure that American consumers receive drugs that are safe and effective. When criminals import and sell misbranded prescription drugs, they risk patients’ safety and health,” said Catherine Hermsen, Acting Director of FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations. “The work that’s done by CBP, FDA and our other partner agencies at the International Mail Facilities, where international mail entering the U.S. is received and processed, provides a front line defense against illegal, illicit, unapproved, counterfeit and potentially dangerous drugs from entering the United States. We are committed to pursuing those who jeopardize the public health by importing and distributing these dangerous products.”“The Postal Service has no interest in being the unwitting accomplice to anyone using the U.S. Mail to distribute misbranded drugs.  By using the mail system for a criminal purpose, Mr. and Mrs. Hayes put our customers’ health at risk.  The U.S. Postal Inspection Service will continue to preserve the integrity of the mail by investigating those who use it illegally.” said Raymond Moss, Acting Inspector in Charge of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Boston Field Division.“Mr. and Mrs. Hayes ran a dangerous operation, distributing unsafe drugs that endangered the public’s health. Their illicit pill mill was a family affair and now they are finally being held accountable,” said Harold H. Shaw, Special Agent in Charge, FBI Boston Division. “The FBI, along with our law enforcement partners, will continue to do everything we can to curtail this illegal activity and ensure that our communities remain safe.“This case shows how vital effective federal law enforcement cooperation is to the safety of Americans,” said Michael Shea, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Boston.  “Through close law enforcement coordination, thousands of Americans were protected from the reckless actions of these individuals, who cared about nothing but enriching themselves at the expense of a serious life-threatening risk to the unwitting American consumer.”This case was investigated by FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Arnold Huftalen and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Sarah Hawkins, who is Senior Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel, U.S. Food and Drug Administration.###Topic(s):Prescription DrugsComponent(s):USAO - New HampshirePress Release Number:18-065"

Davis announced.  A Boise federal grand jury indicted Thomas on January 9, 2018.According to court records, Thomas was employed as a nurse practitioner by a medical facility with multiple facilities in Idaho.  Each facility had a locked cabinet where controlled substances were kept.  Thomas did not have access to the locked cabinets. On at least seven occasions, however, Thomas accessed the cabinets at different facilities, and took bottles of Schedule II controlled substances, including hydrocodone.  Thomas then replaced the controlled substances with different medications, resealed the bottles and placed them back in the cabinets.  For example, on October 31, 2017, Thomas knowingly and intentionally removed a bottle of hydrocodone/APAP 10mg/325mg containing 20 tablets.  She removed the hydrocodone pills, replaced them with Flexeril tablets, and put the bottle back into the cabinet. The replacement of the controlled substances with other medication caused the drugs to be misbranded because the labeling became false and misleading as to the bottle’s contents.  In addition, when Thomas replaced the misbranded drug back into the cabinet, she moved the pack of bottles around to place the misbranded drugs in the back.On two occasions, Thomas knowingly and intentionally forged fraudulent prescriptions to herself using another provider’s information.  For example, on October 26, 2017, Thomas forged a prescription for hydrocodone/APAP 10mg/325mg using another provider’s information to facilitate the crime of obtaining controlled substances by fraud.  The other provider never saw Thomas as a patient and did not authorize the prescription. Thomas fraudulently filled the prescription in Meridian, Idaho, obtaining 30 tablets of hydrocodone/APAP 10mg/325mg.The charge of obtaining controlled substances by fraud is punishable by up to four years in prison, a maximum fine of $250,000, and a term of one year of supervised release.  The charge of identity theft is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, a maximum fine of $250,000, and a term of three years of supervised release. The charge of misbranding a drug while held for sale is punishable by up to three years in prison, a maximum fine of $250,000, and a term of one year of supervised release.Sentencing is set for June 5, 2018, before Senior U.S. District Judge Edward J. Lodge at the federal courthouse in Boise.This case was investigated by the Drug Enforcement Administration led Tactical Diversion Squad, the Ada County Sheriff’s Office, and the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations.Topic(s):Prescription DrugsIdentity TheftComponent(s):USAO - IdahoContact:BARBARA LAYMAN Public Information Officer (208) 334-1211 barbara.layman@usdoj.gov"

McKinley, to one year in prison, ordered to pay $950.00 restitution and ordered to pay a $5,000 fine for distribution of Tramadol, a Schedule IV controlled substance, introduction of misbranded drugs, and wire fraud, announced United States Attorney Russell M. Coleman. There is no parole in the federal system.According to the plea agreement, Skyler Dean Prahl, 32, imported Tramadol powder from overseas and used an encapsulating machine to create Tramadol capsules.  Tramadol is a synthetic opioid drug. For several years Prahl operated an online business marketing and selling Tramadol capsules and other substances to customers throughout the United States.  Prahl sold well over 80,000 units of Tramadol to customers without inquiring or verifying that his customers had a valid prescription.Prahl admitted that on August 31, 2015, he knowingly and intentionally possessed with the intent to distribute, and distributed Tramadol to an undercover agent.He further admitted that on August 31, 2015, with the intent to mislead and defraud, he introduced a misbranded drug, Tramadol, into interstate commerce by shipping Tramadol from Champaign, Illinois, to Owensboro, Kentucky.  The Tramadol was misbranded because its label failed to state the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, and distributor, and because it failed to bear adequate directions for use.Lastly, Prahl admitted that between January 28, 2016, and March 5, 2016, he devised a wire fraud scheme. Specifically, Prahl used email to promise to deliver at least 3,000 Tramadol capsules to “Michael Riley” in return for $950, but failed to deliver the Tramadol capsules even after receiving the funds.This case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney David R.

Gayles. Francois was ordered to pay $31,259,252 in restitution.Patrick Tonge, 42, of Southwest Ranches was sentenced to 188 months in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release. Tonge was also ordered to pay $31,259,252 in restitution.On September 5, 2017, after a one-month trial, a federal jury found Francois guilty of conspiracy to commit health care fraud in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section, 1349 twelve counts of health care fraud  in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1347, conspiracy to pay kickbacks in connection with a federal health care program in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371, five counts of paying kickbacks, in violation of Title 42, United States Code, Section 1320, and twelve counts of money laundering, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1957. In addition, Francois was found guilty of eight counts of introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce in violation of Title 21, United Sates Code, Section 331, four counts of making false statements related to health care matters, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1035 and one count of making a false statement on a DEA form, in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Section 843. The jury found Patrick Tonge guilty of the same conspiracy charges, eleven counts of health care fraud, three counts of paying kickbacks, and two counts of money laundering.  The scheme caused over $31 million in loss to the federal Tricare program and the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program (“FEHBP”), with over $30 million in loss to Tricare alone. The trial was a culmination of a three-year investigation that resulted in 18 convictions.According to evidence presented at trial, Francois, a pharmacist, owned and operated Atlantic Pharmacy and Compounding, located in Pompano Beach, Florida. From there, Francois and his assistant at the pharmacy, Tonge, entered into a vast conspiracy with so-called marketers who paid physicians to write prescriptions for expensive topical medications that cost up to $17,000 a bottle. As the pharmacist-in-charge, Francois was responsible for the compounded medications, which were made in-house by the pharmacy.Francois, Tonge and their co-conspirators agreed to automatically refill the prescriptions, sending numerous refills to patients who did not request them and not charging a co-pay. Francois and Tonge would also pay the marketers from the profits received for each prescription and the marketers, in turn, would pay the physicians. Evidence further showed that some physicians never saw the purported patients. Rather, they used the patient’s identification to write the prescriptions.The trial evidence revealed that Francois and Tonge specifically targeted the Tricare program. Throughout the conspiracy, Atlantic Pharmacy submitted thousands of claims which led Tricare and FEHBP to make payment to Atlantic Pharmacy and Compounding in the approximate amount of $31,259,252. Further evidence presented at trial showed that Francois used the fraud proceeds to buy a $3.6 million mansion once owned by Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson, as well as a Ferrari, two Rolls Royce motor vehicles, and over $1 million in other luxury automobiles.“The fraud committed in this case was particularly egregious, as it targeted the health care program for the men and women in uniform who protect this country,” stated United States Attorney Benjamin G. Greenberg. “The jury’s verdict exemplifies this Office’s tireless commitment to prosecuting healthcare providers and individuals who commit fraud against the Tricare program and any federal health care program.”“This sentencing should serve as a stern warning to corrupt health care providers who defraud Federal health care programs. These defendants engaged in a vast and egregious fraud scheme that specifically targeted the vulnerabilities of the DoD’s TRICARE program, charging outrageous amounts for phony and unneeded prescription medications,” said Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) Special Agent in Charge John F. Khin, Southeast Field Office. “While depriving American military members of legitimate health care and medications, these defendants splurged on a luxurious fantasy lifestyle for themselves supported by the millions of dollars they bilked from TRICARE. Through our aggressive investigative efforts in coordination with our partner agencies, DCIS stopped this shameful abuse of one of DoD’s most critical programs.”“The USPS-OIG, along with our law enforcement partners, has worked diligently to ensure the protection of federal benefit programs from healthcare providers seeking to receive unmerited money from fraudulent claims,” said Special Agent in Charge Christopher Cave, of the U.S. Postal Service Office of the Inspector General Southern Area Field Office. “The sentence imposed today clearly demonstrates these crimes will not be tolerated and serves as a great deterrent to other healthcare providers engaging in these illegal schemes. Our federal government is vigilant against these crimes will be investigated and punished accordingly.”“Today’s sentencing is the direct result of the steadfast dedication of our agents and our partners in federal law enforcement,” said Special Agent in Charge Michael C. Curran, of the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command’s Southeastern Fraud Field Office. “This was a wide-ranging investigation that spanned multiple states and led to the convictions of 18 individuals including doctors, podiatrists, a physician's assistant, and patient recruiters. We will continue to vigorously pursue those who abuse the Tricare program and violate the trust placed in them by the U.S. government.”“Prescription drugs should only be dispensed pursuant to valid prescriptions in order to protect patient safety,” said Justin D. Green, Special Agent in Charge, FDA-OCI’s Miami Field Office‎. “We remain committed to bringing to justice those who place their personal gain over the health of American consumers.”Scott Rezendes, Special Agent in Charge, United States Office of Personnel Management, Office of Inspector General (OPM-OIG). “Today’s sentencing sends a message to professionals in the health care industry that the Federal Government will not tolerate fraud and other unethical behavior. The OPM-OIG, along with our law enforcement partners, is committed to protecting the integrity of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program and ensuring that its funds are used to promote the wellbeing of Federal employees, retirees, and their families.”Mr. Greenberg commended the investigative efforts DCIS, USPS-OIG, U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, OPM-OIG and FDA. This case was prosecuted by AUSA’s Daniel Bernstein, Evelyn Sheehan, Adrienne Rosen and former AUSA Franklin Monsour.Related court documents and information may be found on the website of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida athttp://www.flsd.uscourts.govor onhttp://pacer.flsd.uscourts.gov.Component(s):USAO - Florida, Southern"

Gutierrez. In addition to the prison term, Diaz was ordered to pay a $95,000 fine and $30,000 in restitution to the victim.Diaz pleaded guilty last July to receiving and delivering an adulterated and misbranded medical device. According to a plea agreement filed in the case, the victim – who is identified as “I.T.” – filed a complaint with the California Medical Board after seeking treatments from Diaz to enhance her buttocks. I.T. stated that the product Diaz injected into her buttocks migrated to her “back, hips and legs.”During a series of treatments that cost thousands of dollars, Diaz explained to I.T. that she was injecting a “natural product,” at points claiming the injections were “lamb’s fat.” However, after a series of treatments, I.T. began to suffer pain and experience serious medical complications, which led her to seek the assistance of a doctor in Colombia who specializes in reversing cosmetic procedures.During Monday’s sentencing hearing, I.T. explained that she has experienced a great deal of pain, suffered from infections and complications, and was hospitalized for more than three weeks due to the injections administered by Diaz. I.T. underwent a major surgery to remove the substance injected into her buttocks and received skin grafts to repair the damage. The victim will need further reconstructive medical procedures. I.T. told the court that Diaz had lied to her and that she believed Diaz when Diaz said that the product was safe and would never move.Diaz never told I.T. or her other customers that the product she was injecting into their buttocks had been illegally smuggled into the United States from Mexico, that the product was a medical device that was not approved for use in the United States for the purpose of enhancing buttocks or body contouring, and that she was not licensed in the United States to perform any such medical procedure.Diaz intentionally defrauded and misled her customers regarding the safety of the substance and the nature of her qualifications to use the illegally smuggled medical device for body contouring purposes. Diaz injected the liquid substance into at least 10 customers – earning at least $40,000 from her illegal conduct. Despite the risk of death or serious bodily injury to her customers, and notwithstanding complaints from customers that they had suffered injuries from the procedure, Diaz recklessly continued to inject her customers with the smuggled and illegal substance.This case was investigated by the United States Food and Drug Administration – Office of Criminal Investigations and the California Medical Board.This case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Joseph O. Johns, Chief of the Environmental and Community Safety Crimes Section, and Assistant United States Attorney Amanda M.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseMarch 8, 2018United States Department of JusticeDistrict of Puerto RicoDefendants face a forfeiture allegation of $3,699,901.94SAN JUAN, P.R. – On March 7, 2018, a Federal grand jury returned a 28-count indictment charging four individuals with mail and wire fraud conspiracy, mail fraud, trafficking in counterfeit goods, introducing misbranded articles into interstate commerce, distribution of a controlled substance, international money laundering, and smuggling, announced Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney for the District of Puerto Rico. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement-Homeland Security Investigation, and US Postal Inspectors were in charge of the investigation with the collaboration of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Puerto Rico Department of Treasury (Departamento de Hacienda).According to the indictment, defendants Carlos Enrique Velázquez-Gines, Mayra Evelise Gines-Otero, Noriam Ivette Flores-Deleon, and Vanessa Marrero-Hernández marketed and offered numerous purported “dietary supplements” for male enhancement or weight loss, which were in fact “drugs” under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) for sale to American consumers. Defendants marketed and sold the products through “online stores” on platforms such as eBay.com and Bonanzo.com, using seller name “lostchildinpr” and “deleon1988.” The products listed in the indictment include: Foreign-labeled product, XXXplosion, Power, Hard Ten Days, Zhansheng Weige, ExtenZe, ExtenZe Plus, La Pepa Negra, Lang Yi Hao, FX3000, Shark Extract, Black Storm, USA Power, Plant Vigra, Para Hombres Paradise, Jack Rabbit, Rhino 12 Titanium, Rhino 69, African Black Ant, Paradise Ultra Plus, Figa XP, U-fit, Natural Max Slimming Advanced – Appetite Reducer, and Natural Max Slimming Advanced – Fat Burner.Many of the counterfeit male-enhancement pills contain the active pharmaceutical ingredient (sildenafil), found in popular and well-known products such as “Viagra” and “Cialis,” and these products do not advertise that pharmaceutical ingredient. Defendants also sold counterfeit condoms. Male latex condoms are medical “devices” under the FDCA.The defendants also marketed and offered for sale purported Kylie Cosmetics brand products, including lipstick kits. Lipstick is a “cosmetic” under the FDCA. Analysis of the purported Kylie Lip Kit distributed by defendants was conducted by FDA/manufacturer, which confirmed that the lipstick and its labeling were counterfeit.The object of the conspiracy was for defendants to unlawfully enrich themselves by purchasing from overseas suppliers, illegally importing into the United States, and subsequently selling to American consumers, FDA-regulated products that were counterfeit and/or misbranded. From at least on or about October 3, 2013 defendants purchased from overseas suppliers located in China, and imported into the United States “dietary supplements,” latex condoms, and make-up, that were counterfeit and/or misbranded under the FDCA. In an effort to evade detection by law enforcement, when ordering the illegal products from China, defendants had the packages shipped to a trans-shipper located in Miami, Florida, who would then re-package and/or re-label the parcels and send them to defendants in Puerto Rico.Defendants mailed and caused to be mailed through the United States Postal Service numerous packages to customers across the United States containing counterfeit and/or misbranded products. They used a residence located in Villa Blanca, Manatí, P.R. as a warehouse to store and distribute the unlawful products they purchased from overseas suppliers and re-sold to customers. The defendants also distributed wholesale quantities of the counterfeit and/or misbranded products imported from overseas to wholesale buyers. Defendant Carlos Enrique Velázquez-Gines,initiated numerous wire transfers of funds to overseas suppliers to pay for the unlawful products purchased and imported by the defendants.“These defendants sold counterfeit and misbranded medical devices, as well as counterfeit and misbranded male-enhancement pills. Some of these medications contained drugs that the consumers were not aware of and could cause danger to their health, including heart attacks or strokes,” said Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, U.S. Attorney for the District of Puerto Rico. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office will continue to work with the FDA to protect the public from adulterated and misbranded products, and to ensure that dietary supplement sellers provide accurate information about their products.”“Americans must have confidence that the FDA-regulated products they use are authentic, safe and properly labeled,” said Justin D. Green, Special Agent in Charge, FDA OCI’s Miami Field Office. “We remain fully committed to aggressively pursuing those who place unsuspecting U.S. consumers at risk by distributing illegal drugs, devices or cosmetics.”“The trafficking of counterfeit goods is simply illegal and in some cases, as this, it becomes a problem of public health and safety and at times threatens national security,” said Orlando Baez, the acting special agent in charge who oversees HSI operations throughout Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. “This illegal activity represents a triple threat as it delivers substandard and often dangerous goods into the economy, rob citizens of good-paying jobs, and generate proceeds that are often funneled back into other criminal enterprises. HSI will continue to work with its enforcement partners to combat the distribution of counterfeit products especially those who that endanger public health.”Consumers can contact FDA’s MedWatch program at 1-800-FDA-1088 to report suspected serious adverse events, product quality problems, or product use errors associated with the use of an FDA-regulated product, as well as suspected counterfeit medical products.Defendants are facing a forfeiture allegation of $3,699,901.94, six properties or homes, two bank accounts, one Pay Pal account, and three certificates of deposit. If convicted, the defendants face a maximum possible sentence of 30 years for the conspiracy charges, 10 years for trafficking counterfeit goods, three years for introducing and receiving misbranded products in interstate commerce. Velázquez-Gines is also facing up to 20 years in prison for international money laundering and 20 years for smuggling. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward Veronda. An indictment contains only charges and is not evidence of guilt. Defendants are presumed to be innocent unless and until proven guilty.# # #Topic(s):Consumer ProtectionDrug TraffickingFinancial FraudComponent(s):USAO - Puerto Rico"

Betancourt-Farfán was arrested and indicted in December 2016 and pled guilty on May 12, 2017. The US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI) was in charge of the investigation.According to the information gathered during the investigation, liquid silicone is sometimes injected into the body to “augment” tissues, such as the buttocks or breasts. When intended for tissue augmentation, liquid silicone is a “device” under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and is subject to FDA approval before it can legally be distributed and used for such use in the United States. FDA has not approved any liquid silicone products for injection to augment tissues anywhere in the body.  In addition, the injection of liquid silicone into the body for tissue augmentation can result in serious adverse health consequences, including hardening of tissue at the injection site, embolization, and even death.On or about May 23, 2016, Puerto Rico Board of Health, Legal Division, contacted the FDA-OCI to advise of a complainant who received medical procedures from a female individual who claimed to be a nurse. It was further indicated that the complainant received treatment to enlarge his/her buttocks and that the female individual was identified as “Rosa from Venezuela” (later identified as Rosa Betancourt-Farfán).The complainant was interviewed by FDA-OCI agents and indicated that she had been injected in both glutes with one (1) vial by Betancourt-Farfán, for which she paid twelve hundred dollars ($1,200.00) in cash, but was having health problems during the summer of 2013. These problems consisted first with trouble breathing and back pain. Her health condition worsened on or about 2015, when she was hospitalized with tendonitis and back spasms.“Your life is in danger if you have received any of these adulterated treatments. We urge people not to trust those who claim to be medical professionals and offer treatments outside of certified medical offices victimizing patients. The US Attorney’s Office is committed to protecting patients from medical frauds,” stated Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, US Attorney for the District of Puerto Rico.“Liquid silicone injected into individuals’ bodies can cause serious harm and even death, and FDA has not approved any such product for body contouring,” said Justin D. Green, Special Agent in Charge, FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations’ Miami Field Office. “We will continue to aggressively pursue and bring to justice those who endanger American consumers by offering these hazardous procedures.”Assistant U.S. Attorney Myriam Fernández prosecuted the case. The case was investigated by the FDA, with assistance from Homeland Security Investigations.# # #Topic(s):Health Care Fraud"

United States District Judge Donald E. Walter presided over the sentencing hearing.Evidence admitted at the nine-day trial that ended November 7, 2017 showed that from November 11, 2010 to December 2012 Hebert, Kohll’s Pharmacy & Healthcare Inc. of Omaha, Neb., which operated as Essential Pharmacy Compounding, and others conspired to distribute a synthetic form of the drug Dermorphin, which was then given to racehorses to improve their racing performance.  Essential Pharmacy Compounding repackaged a synthetic form of the drug that it obtained from a California chemical company, labeled it as D-Peptide, and sold it to Hebert and other veterinarians.  Hebert then put the drug into syringes and gave the loaded syringes to the racetrack trainers tasked with the horses’ care.  Evidence showed that Demorphin is a strong painkiller that masks horses’ pain and any pre-existing injuries.  Depending on dosage, it can also act as a stimulant when injected in horses.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseFebruary 28, 2018United States Department of JusticeCentral District of CaliforniaLOS ANGELES– Two doctors were arrested this morning on federal fraud charges stemming from more than $250 million in allegedly fraudulent bills related to the 1-800-GET-THIN Lap-Band surgery business.Julian Omidi, 49, of West Hollywood, and Mirali Zarrabi, 55, of Beverly Hills, were arrested pursuant to a federal indictment that alleges a host of criminal charges stemming from GET THIN’s Lap-Band (or bariatric) surgery and sleep study programs between May 2010 and March 2016.Two corporations controlled, in part, by Omidi – Surgery Center Management, LLC (SCM), and Independent Medical Services, Inc. (IMS) – are also named in the 37-count superseding indictment that was unsealed today.The indictment contains charges of mail fraud, wire fraud, false statements, money laundering and aggravated identity theft.Omidi, a physician whose license was revoked in 2009, controlled, in part, the GET THIN network of entities, including SCM and IMS, that focused on the promotion and performance of elective, Lap-Band weight-loss surgeries. Omidi established procedures requiring prospective Lap-Band patients – even those covered by insurance plans he knew would never cover Lap-Band surgery – to have at least one sleep study, and employees were incentivized with commissions to make sure the studies occurred, according to the indictment. The purpose of the sleep studies was to find a second reason – a “co-morbidity,” such as sleep apnea – that GET THIN would use to convince the patient’s insurance company to pre-approve the Lap-Band procedure.After patients underwent sleep studies – often with little indication that any doctor had ever determined the study was medically necessary – GET THIN employees, acting at Omidi’s direction, allegedly often falsified the results to reflect that the patient had moderate or severe sleep apnea, and that they suffered from severe daytime sleepiness. Omidi then caused those falsified sleep study reports to be used in support of GET THIN’s pre-authorization requests for Lap-Band surgery.Relying on the false sleep studies – as well as other false information, including patients’ heights and weights – insurance companies authorized payment for some of the proposed Lap-Band surgeries. The indictment alleges that GET THIN received at least $38 million for the Lap-Band procedures.Even if the insurance company did not authorize the surgery, GET THIN still was able to submit bills for approximately $15,000 for each sleep study, receiving millions of dollars in payments for these claims, according to the indictment. The insurance payments were deposited into bank accounts associated with the GET THIN entities.The victim health care benefit programs include TriCare, Anthem Blue Cross, UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Cigna and others.“The scheme outlined in the indictment focuses on bogus sleep studies that the defendants utilized to engage in a much more lucrative fraud involving Lap-Band procedures,” said Acting United States Attorney Sandra R. Brown. “Patients were harmed as a result of this fraud scheme when they were subjected to unnecessary medical procedures, and insurance providers were harmed when they paid out tens of millions of dollars after receiving fraudulent bills.”Zarrabi allowed his electronic signature to be used by GET THIN to make it falsely appear that he had reviewed and interpreted the falsified sleep studies, even though he knew the reports were being altered, according to the indictment. Zarrabi also allegedly demanded to be paid for the use of his electronic signature on hundreds of prescriptions for devices to treat sleep apnea. Zarrabi allegedly did not review the prescriptions, which were sent with the falsified sleep study reports to durable medical equipment providers that billed for sleep apnea equipment that patients often did not need.“While the defendants in this case were scheming victims who had hopes of ‘getting thin,’ they were also busy getting rich by defrauding the insurance companies and exploiting unwitting victims in many cases,” said Paul Delacourt, the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office. “The FBI and its law enforcement partners worked collaboratively to reach this successful result and will continue to hold the perpetrators of health care fraud accountable.”“The FDA takes seriously its responsibility to protect patients by requiring truthful, non-misleading, and accurate information in the labeling of FDA-regulated products, such as medical devices,” said Lisa L. Malinowski, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Los Angeles Field Office. “Patients, who may be influenced by false or misleading information, need to be fully aware of the risks of any surgical procedure.”“Doctor Zarrabi and former physician Omidi victimized countless patients when they allegedly provided medically unnecessary treatment in order to boost their own profits to the tune of tens of millions of dollars,” said California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones. “Medical provider fraud is multi-billion dollar problem that drives up health insurance premiums and creates a drain on our economy.”In 2014, the government seized more than $110 million in funds and securities from accounts held by individuals and entities involved in the criminal scheme described in the indictment, including Omidi. The government is seeking forfeiture of some or all of those funds in the criminal case, and also intends to pursue civil forfeiture of some or all of the assets.“Driven by greed, Omidi and Zarrabi allegedly sought to cheat their way to riches by bilking millions of dollars from Tricare and other health care providers,” stated R. Damon Rowe, Special Agent in Charge for IRS Criminal Investigation. “Those who betray patients and commit health care fraud steal from taxpayers‎ and insurance providers, while corrupting the integrity of our nation’s health care system. IRS Criminal Investigation and our law enforcement partners will investigate and criminally prosecute such fraud schemes to the fullest extent of the law.”Omidi and Zarrabi, along with the corporate defendants, are scheduled to be arraigned on the indictment this afternoon in United States District Court.An indictment contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty in court.If they were to be convicted in this case, Omidi and Zarrabi potentially would face decades in federal prison, including a statutory maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each of the 31 mail fraud and wire fraud counts alleged in the indictment.This case is the product of an investigation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Defense Criminal Investigative Service; IRS Criminal Investigation; the California Department of Insurance; and the California Department of Justice.The GET THIN case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Kristen A.

(“Cumberland”), was convicted yesterday by a federal jury in Nashville of conspiracy, 15 counts of mail fraud and one count of making false statements to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), announced Donald Q. Cochran, U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee.The charges stemmed from an indictment in January 2013, alleging a 32-month, $50-million-dollar drug diversion scheme.  The convictions came after a five-day trial before visiting United States District Judge Billy Wilson.  Smith’s co-defendants, Charles Jeffrey Edwards, 56, and Brenda Elise Edwards, 47, both of Houston, previously pleaded guilty to related charges and will be sentenced at a later date.The evidence at trial established that, from December 2006 through August 2009, Smith and Jeff Edwards purchased millions of dollars of prescription drugs from unlicensed suppliers who had previously purchased the drugs from patients in and around New York and Miami.  In most instances, Smith had these drugs shipped to Cumberland’s Nashville warehouse where they were cleaned, sorted, re-packaged, and shipped to independent pharmacies around the country.  Generally, the diverted drugs included drugs used to combat HIV/AIDS; antipsychotic medications; anti-depressants; blood pressure medications; diabetes medications and others.Smith and Jeff Edwards also had drugs shipped from their unlicensed suppliers to shell companies in Louisiana and Arkansas.  Although these companies were licensed to sell drugs, Smith and Jeff Edwards used them as pass-through companies to create the appearance that Cumberland was purchasing drugs from licensed suppliers, when, in fact, Cumberland was purchasing diverted drugs from un-licensed suppliers in New York and Miami.  The drugs arriving at Smith’s shell companies were forwarded to Cumberland’s Nashville warehouse and re-sold to independent pharmacies.In order to conceal the drugs’ true origins, Smith and his co-conspirators provided false documentation to Cumberland’s pharmacy customers.Numerous pharmacies reported problems with drugs they purchased from Cumberland, including prescription drug bottles containing the wrong medicine; the wrong dosage information; and foreign objects inside.  At trial, several witnesses testified that at least one bottle of prescription drugs sold by Cumberland contained tic tacs instead of medicine.On May 14, 2009, the FDA executed a federal search warrant at Cumberland’s Nashville warehouse.  Thereafter, in order to evade authorities, Smith and his co-conspirators rented another warehouse, utilized freight forwarding companies to receive drug shipments, set up private email accounts, purchased burner phones and hired a private pilot to fly drugs to Nashville.  Their scheme resulted in gross proceeds of over $50 million.Smith faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each count of mail fraud.  He also faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for his conspiracy and false statements convictions when he is sentenced later this year.This case was investigated by the United States Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigation.  It is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Henry C.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseFebruary 21, 2018United States Department of JusticeNorthern District of AlabamaBIRMINGHAM– A federal judge today sentenced a former lead technician at a central Alabama pharmacy to five years in prison for tampering with vials of opioid painkillers used in the compounding of intravenous fluid bags intended for terminally ill patients in debilitating pain.U.S. Attorney Jay E. Town, Drug Enforcement Administration Assistant Special Agent in Charge Bret Hamilton and Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, Acting Special Agent in Charge Peter Kuehl announced the sentence.U.S. District Judge R. David Proctor sentencedJOHNATHON WILLIAM CLICK, 30, of Bessemer, on one-count of tampering with consumer products in reckless disregard for the risk that another person would be placed in danger of death or bodily injury, and under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to that risk. Click pleaded guilty to the charge in November.“Jonathan Click knew he was inflicting untold pain and suffering on terminally ill cancer patients, yet for two years he diluted their medication and took the opioid drugs for himself,” U.S. Attorney Town said. “Mr. Click is going to prison for his crime, and he will be joined shortly by those like him.”“Patients deserve to have confidence that they are receiving the proper treatment from those entrusted with providing their medical care,” said FDA Acting Special Agent in Charge Kuehl. “That’s why we must hold medical personnel accountable when they take advantage of their unique position and tamper with drugs needed by their patients, especially when such tampering causes additional pain and suffering for those who are terminally-ill.”“DEA is committed to investigating and bringing to justice those who divert prescription drugs. Opiate abuse is a major problem across the nation, with over four million Americans addicted to prescription drugs,” DEA Assistant Special Agent in Charge Hamilton said. “The sentencing of this pharmacy technician should send a clear message to those within the medical profession. DEA will continue to work with our federal, state and local law enforcement and regulatory partners to prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law.”Click worked at Birmingham-based ContinuumRx of Central Alabama, which primarily distributes IV bags containing morphine and hydromorphone for palliative care of patients in hospice or homecare. The majority of CRX’s patients were terminally ill with cancer and suffering breakthrough pain. Click, as the lead pharmacy technician, prepared the vast majority of CRX’s IV bags, which helped safeguard his scheme, according to court documents.Between December 2014 and September 2016, when CRX ended Click’s employment, he removed morphine sulfate and hydromorphone hydrochloride from vials intended for use in mixing IV bags. He diluted the vials to hide his theft, knowing that patients in excruciating pain would receive the diluted pain medication, according to the government’s sentencing memorandum. The document states that Click stole the medication so he could feed his opioid addiction.“The nature and circumstances of this offense shock the conscience,” the government said in its sentencing memorandum. Click’s victims “were painfully dying – because the defendant tampered with their medicine for his own gratification. In their final days on earth, the defendant denied them the comfort of pain remediation they so desperately needed. The defendant knew what he was doing each time he tampered with those vials of medicine.”According to the sentencing memorandum and Click’s plea agreement, he surreptitiously removed vials of morphine and hydromorphone from CRX’s locked inventory, withdrew drugs from the vials with a syringe and replaced the withdrawn amount with saline or sterile water. Click then would return the adulterated and diluted vials to the inventory, undetected, and later use the vials to compound IV bags that were distributed and administered to homecare and hospice patients. CRX’s primary customers are Alacare Home Health & Hospice, New Beacon Hospice, Lakeview Homecare & Hospice, Comfort Care Hospice and Kindred Hospice.DEA, FDA and the Alabama Board of Pharmacy investigated the case, which Assistant U.S. Attorney Mohammad Khatib prosecuted.Attachment(s):Download click_exhibit_photos.pdfDownload click_usa_sent._memo.pdfTopic(s):OpioidsComponent(s):USAO - Alabama, Northern"

Field Office.  “I commend the work of my team, under the leadership of AUSAs Monica Coleman and Meredith Thomas and the critical work of our law enforcement partners,” said United States Attorney Mike Stuart.  Stuart commended the investigation conducted by agents with:·U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, OIG·Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigations·Food and Drug Administration – Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI)·Federal Bureau of Investigation·Drug Enforcement Administration·West Virginia State Police·Metropolitan Drug Enforcement Network Team (MDENT)·Beckley Police Department·Kentucky State Police·Harrison County (KY) Sheriff’s Department·Appalachia HIDTAThe charges announced today aggressively target medical professionals involved in the unlawful distribution of opioids and other dangerous controlled substances. “As of today, there are 69 counts.  10 doctors in total. Clinics from Beckley to Beaver, and Charleston to Wytheville. Lots and lots of pills, and even more misery,” said United States Attorney Mike Stuart.   Stuart continued, “Home-grown drug dealers hidden behind the veil of a doctor’s lab coat, a medical degree and a prescription pad are every bit as bad as the heroin dealers from Detroit who bring their poisons to West Virginia.  Today’s 69-count indictment is the continuation of our efforts to hold accountable those who prey on the good citizens of West Virginia.”The following individuals are charged in the indictment: James H. Blume, Jr., D.O, Mark T. Radcliffe, Joshua Radcliffe, Michael T. Moran, M.D., Sanjay Mehta, D.O., Brian Gullett, D.O., Vernon Stanley, M.D., Mark Clarkson, D.O., William Easley, D.O., Paul W. Burke, M.D., Roswell Tempest Lowry, M.D., and Teresa Emerson, LNP. “We are committed to protecting all those in government health programs,” said Maureen R. Dixon, Special Agent in Charge of the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “Working side by side with our law enforcement partners we will aggressively investigate charges of medical providers needlessly prescribing deadly opioids.”In addition to the conspiracy charge, the indictment charges defendants Blume and Mark Radcliffe with maintaining drug-involved premises in Beckley, Beaver and Charleston, and includes 62 counts charging several physicians with distribution of controlled substances not for legitimate medical purposes and outside the usual course of professional practice. The indictment also charges Sanjay Mehta, D.O., a former physician at the Beckley and Beaver HOPE Clinic locations, with two counts of distribution of controlled substances causing death, and charges 10 of the defendants with conspiracy to launder drug proceeds by paying bonuses to HOPE Clinic physicians and employees of Patients, Physicians, and Pharmacists Fighting Diversion, Inc. (PPPFD), to encourage continued prescribing of Schedule II narcotics to customers.According to the indictment, defendant James H. Blume, Jr., D.O., the owner of the HOPE Clinic, entered into a Physician Practice Management Agreement with defendant Mark T. Radcliffe, owner of PPPFD, to be the practice manager of the HOPE Clinic. The indictment alleges that together Blume and Radcliffe operated HOPE Clinic as a cash-based business that prescribed oxycodone and other Schedule II controlled substances to customers, while refusing to accept insurance, charging in-state customers at least $275 for an initial appointment, and at least $160 for each subsequent appointment.  Out of state customers paid as much as $330 for initial visits and at least $185 for subsequent visits.   The indictment alleges that HOPE Clinic practitioners prescribed thousands of oxycodone-based pills to individual customers and some HOPE Clinic locations, including Beaver and Charleston, averaged 65 or more customers a day during a 10-hour workday with only one practitioner working.  In addition, the indictment alleges that Blume and Mark T. Radcliffe contracted the services of physicians without any knowledge of pain management who consistently conducted cursory, incomplete, or no medical examinations of Clinic customers and provided large amounts of Schedule II prescription medications to customers that they knew, and had reasonable cause to believe, were drug addicts. The indictment further alleges that Mark T. Radcliffe and his son, Joshua Radcliffe, neither of whom had any formal medical education or training, instructed medical practitioners at HOPE Clinic to provide customers with prescriptions for Schedule II controlled substances, sometimes in direct contrast with the practitioners’ clinical opinions.\"Those who facilitate the abuse of controlled dangerous substances are negatively impacting our entire community and will be held accountable,” said Kimberly Lappin, Special Agent in Charge, IRS Criminal Investigation, Washington D.C. Field Office.  “Today’s indictment is a reminder that IRS-CI will remain vigilant in our financial investigations and will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to combat this type of conduct.”If convicted on all charges as alleged in the indictment, Dr. Blume and Mark Radcliffe face up to 100 years; Joshua Radcliffe faces up to 20 years; Teresa Emerson faces up to 20 years; Michael Moran faces up to 60 years; Sanjay Mehta faces a forty year mandatory minimum sentence up to life imprisonment; Vernon Stanley faces up to 240 years; Brian Gullett faces up to 340 years; Mark Clarkson faces up to 80 years; William Earley faces up to 200 years; Paul Burke faces up to 180 years; and Roswell Tempest Lowry faces up to 120 years.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseAugust 19, 2016United States Department of JusticeWestern District of KentuckyLOUISVILLE, Ky. – United States Attorney John E. Kuhn, Jr. this week charged several defendants and businesses, all tied to a multi-million-dollar internet scheme to dispense medications to customers without a valid prescription, with ten criminal charges. The indicted charges include an internet pharmacy conspiracy, conspiracy to distribute misbranded drugs, distributing misbranded drugs, mail fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, health care fraud, engaging in the unlicensed wholesale distribution of prescription drugs, aggravated identity theft, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and obstruction of a criminal investigation.According to the indictment, beginning in June of 2009 and continuing until at least April of 2012, defendant Philip Michael caused prescription drugs to be provided to customers of the website RX Limited. Specifically, through Aracoma Pharmacy and MEDS 2 GO Pharmacy, Michael filled and shipped various prescription drug orders to customers, for RX Limited and other internet websites, located across the United States and in the Western District of Kentucky, who did not have a valid prescription. These prescription drug orders were shipped to various states, which by law, required a valid prescription, prior to the drugs being dispensed. Customers would receive a prescription without ever seeing or speaking with a physician or medical practitioner, rendering the prescription invalid. Rather, customers would merely choose which prescription drug he or she wanted and complete an online medical questionnaire. The website operator would then send the completed online medical questionnaire by electronic means to an issuing doctor, including Eutan Laing, John Burlington, Edward Kaplan, and others known and unknown by the Grand Jury. (Physicians Burlington and Kaplan have pleaded guilty to charges in the Southern District of New York.) The drug would be prescribed without verifying the customers’ medical complaint, having an adequate patient history, performing a mental or physical exam, using appropriate diagnostic or laboratory testing, and providing a means to monitor the customer’s response to the medication. Then the invalid prescription would be filled by MEDS 2 Go or Aracoma, and shipped to customers across the United States.During the course of the Internet Pharmacy Scheme, bank accounts controlled by Michael allegedly received approximately $4,000,000 from website operators, and others known and unknown to the Grand Jury. Physicians Laing, J.N.B., E.S.K., and others, were allegedly paid by website operators via wire transfers in excess of $800,000.Further, MEDS 2 GO is charged with distributing misbranded drugs as the medications were not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer the drugs. Dispensing of Soma - a muscle relaxant, Ultram – a painkiller, and Fioricet – a treatment for tension headaches without a valid prescription caused the drugs to become misbranded.Additionally, Michael is charged with defrauding a health care benefit program by submitting a fraudulent claim for payment to Humana Insurance Company for dispensing medication to P.R. which was never dispensed.Also, Michael is charged with aggravated identity theft for using the name, date of birth and other identifying information for P.R. and the name and NPI number of A.S., a physician, to submit a fraudulent claim for payment.In addition, proceeds from alleged criminal activities are subject to forfeiture to the United States. This includes, but is not limited to, an annuity and life insurance policy, vehicles associated with defendants Philip Michael and Meds 2 Go (2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee, 2011 Cadillac Escalade, 2008 Toyota Sequoia, and 2007 Chevy Corvette), a money judgement not less than 4 million dollars.In the event of a conviction, the potential penalties range from 2 years to 20 years in prison for each specific count, a $250,000 fine for each count, and supervised release for a period of three years.  The aggravated identity theft charge carries a minimum penalty of 2 years.The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Lettricea Jefferson-Webb, and it results from an investigation conducted by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, the Kentucky State Police and the West Virginia State Police.***The charge of a person by Federal Indictment is an accusation only and that person is presumed innocent until and unless proven guiltyUSAO - Kentucky, WesternTopic:Healthcare FraudIdentity TheftDownload meds2go_indictment_8-18-16.pdfThose charged were: Philip E Michael II of Alum Creek, West Virginia, and his business MEDS 2 GO, Inc. later known as MEDS 2 GO Express Pharmacy, Inc.; physician Euton Laing, of Piscataway, New Jersey, who is licensed to practice medicine in New Jersey, and was employed by RX Limited – a website selling prescription drugs over the internet; Mark Reinhard of Cross Lanes, West Virginia, who is charged with being an unlicensed wholesale distributor of prescription drugs; and Joetta Kuhn (of no familial relation to U.S. Attorney John Kuhn) of Louisville, Kentucky, who is charged with obstructing a criminal investigation."

Greenberg, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, Peter H. Kuehl, Acting Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Food & Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI), Miami Field Office, Mark Selby, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-HSI), Miami Field Office, andScott Israel, Sheriff, Broward County Sheriff’s Office (BSO), made the announcement.U.S. District Judge Kathleen M. Williams sentenced each of Shukla and Panchal to 23 months imprisonment, to be followed by supervised release for two years.  Judge Williams sentenced Jubilee to corporate probation of two years and ordered Jubilee to forfeit $300,000 to the United States.All three defendants previously pled guilty to conspiring with each other, with the intent to defraud and mislead, sell and cause the sale and dispensing of a counterfeit tobacco product (cigarettes), the containers and labeling of which bore the trade name and marks of the American brand of Newport cigarettes, a tobacco product listed with the FDA pursuant to Title 21, United States Code, Section 387(e)(i)(1), (approximately 68,600 cartons of cigarettes), while knowingly using a counterfeit mark on and in connection with such cigarettes, the use of which marks was likely to cause confusion, to cause mistake, and to deceive. The counterfeit marks were substantially indistinguishable from the marks of the United States domestic manufacturer of Newport brand cigarettes, which marks were then in use by and registered to that manufacturer on the principal register of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, all in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371.According to court records, including a Joint Factual Statement submitted by the parties, beginning in March 2015 and continuing through August 16, 2017, the defendants initiated contact with an individual cooperating with FDA-OCI, offering counterfeit cigarettes for sale. Through internet negotiations, an agreement was reached for a 20-foot container filled with counterfeit Newport brand cigarettes to be shipped from India to Miami.  Payment for the shipment was made in installments through international wire transfers to bank accounts in India and in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. On November 1, 2016, the container arrived and was seized at the Port of Miami with the assistance of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Officers. If distributed in the State of Florida, the un-taxed importation would have an approximate value of $1.2 million. Analysis conducted by FDA’s Forensic Chemistry Center determined that the cartons, packs, and cigarettes were all counterfeit.Within two weeks of the arrival, the coconspirators sought out FDA-OCI undercover agents offering another shipment, twice as large. By April 2017, deposits totaling $55,000 had been made for more counterfeit Newport cigarettes. On June 9, 2017, the container arrived at the Port of Miami and was again seized with the assistance of Customs and Border Protection Officers, and turned over to FDA-OCI Special Agents. If distributed in the State of Florida, the un-taxed importation would have an approximate value of $3.2 million.According to acts described in the conspiracy charge, Shukla and Panchal traveled to Miami in August 2017 to meet with the undercover agents to promote further business dealings. During the recorded meeting, they advised the agents that they had been partners for twelve years and personally oversaw the production of all the products being offered. They also assured the agents that they could counterfeit any American-made menthol cigarette with no problem, as well as other trademarked brands, and that they could produce tobacco blends, which would closely match the legitimate product.Mr. Greenberg commended the investigative efforts of FDA-OCI, ICE-HSI and BSO, for their assistance with this long-term investigation.  Mr. Greenberg also thanked U.S. Customs and Border Protection for their support.  This matter was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Watts-FitzGerald.A copy of this press release may be found on the website of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida atwww.usdoj.gov/usao/fls.Related court documents and information may be found on the website of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida athttp://www.flsd.uscourts.govor onhttp://pacer.flsd.uscourts.gov"

Jaquith.  On November 20, 2017, the Kohs pled guilty to receiving and delivering misbranded drugs, a misdemeanor, and are scheduled to be sentenced on March 20, 2018 by United States Magistrate Judge Daniel J. Stewart.The Kohs own and operate a medical practice, with offices in Poughkeepsie and Glens Falls, New York, that specializes in the treatment of patients suffering from various forms of cancer.  From mid-2010 to early 2012, the practice purchased various drugs purporting to contain the same active ingredients as drugs sold in the United States from a Canadian drug distributor who had obtained these drugs from foreign sources.  The drugs, some of which contained labeling in foreign languages, were not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as required for them to be distributed in the United States and were therefore not reimbursable by Medicare.Dr. Koh’s practice purchased the foreign drugs at substantially lower prices than those charged for drugs from legitimate U.S. drug manufacturers and distributors.  Dr. Koh administered these drugs to his patients, and caused his staff to submit false claims for the drugs to Medicare.“Unlike prescription drugs picked up at a pharmacy, chemotherapeutic drugs generally are administered without any opportunity for patients to see the labeling, so cancer patients are particularly vulnerable to this sort of conduct,” said United States Attorney Jaquith.  “This settlement reflects our ongoing commitment to safeguarding patients and the federal fisc by ensuring that people do not unknowingly receive and taxpayers do not pay for foreign drugs that the FDA has not approved.”“Patients deserve the security of knowing that the medication being prescribed to them is unadulterated, safeguarded, and properly manufactured,” said Scott J. Lampert, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General’s New York Region (HHS-OIG).  “This settlement is another example of HHS-OIG’s commitment to protecting quality of care and the federal health care programs intended for our most vulnerable Americans.”The investigation and settlement were the result of a coordinated effort among the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of New York, HHS-OIG, FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel, and FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations.  The United States was represented in the civil investigation by Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam J.

Kuehl, Acting Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI), Miami Field Office, and Frank Robey, Director, U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command’s Major Procurement Fraud Unit, made the announcement.On February 5, 2018, a federal jury in Miami unanimously convictedMonty Ray Grow, 46, on 18 criminal counts including conspiracy to commit health care fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1347; conspiracy to pay and receive health care kickbacks, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; unlawful receipt of health care kickbacks, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)(1)(A); and money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957.Evidence presented at trial established that during an 8-month span in 2014-15, Grow participated in a scheme to defraud the Tricare program out of tens of millions of dollars. Tricare is the health care program for the U.S. military that pays the health care costs of active and retired military personnel and their families. That insurance benefit includes paying for any medications that a Tricare beneficiary needs.  Grow enticed Tricare beneficiaries to order very expensive drugs that they did not need. Tricare, not the patients, paid the bill for these expensive drugs and the pharmacy split 50% of the profits with Grow.  Evidence at trial established that Grow targeted Tricare beneficiaries and induced them to order expensive drugs they did not need by paying them either directly for their own prescriptions or indirectly for those of their family and friends.  As a result of that scheme, Grow received nearly $20 million in kickbacks from a Broward County pharmacy.In furtherance of his fraud scheme, Grow fraudulently inflated the price the pharmacy would bill to Tricare by manipulating the formulations and selling ingredients to the pharmacy that were artificially engineered in order to maximize profits.  Grow also paid telemedicine companies whose doctors ratified those prescriptions he pre-selected with the knowledge that no doctor ever examined a single patient.  Finally, Grow laundered the criminal proceeds of his scheme through the purchase of luxury items.To date, at least eight additional co-conspirators have pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges arising out of Grow’s fraud scheme, includingGinger Lay, 40, of Atlanta, Georgia;Paul Robinson, 40, of Ormond Beach, Florida;Deanna Dutting, 40, of Ormond Beach, Florida,Raymond Bear, 46, of Flemming Island, Florida;Robin Halliburton, 45 of Ponte Vedra, Florida;Michael Shane Matthews, 47, of Newberry, Florida,Michael Bowman, 43, of Jacksonville, Florida, andSven Bjerke, 39, of Jacksonville, Florida.  These individuals have collectively remitted property back to the United States valued in the approximate amount of $3.3 million.  Grow is scheduled to be sentenced before U.S. District Judge Federico A. Moreno on April 16, 2018, at 9:30 a.m.“Monty Grow has been held responsible for an egregious fraud scheme that unlawfully diverted approximately $20 million in federal health care monies that were set aside for the men and women in uniform who serve and protect our country and jeopardized the public’s health for personal gain,” stated United States Attorney Benjamin G. Greenberg.  “The U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners will continue to work tirelessly to identify for prosecution individuals, including healthcare providers, who not only carry out fraudulent schemes against Tricare or other federal health care programs for their own personal financial benefit at a loss to the deserving beneficiaries, but also endanger our community.”“The Defense Criminal Investigative Service is committed to protecting the integrity of the U.S. military health care program to provide top quality medical care to America’s Warfighters and their families, while ensuring that health care providers and facilities comply with Federal laws,” said John F. Khin, Special Agent in Charge, DCIS - Southeast Field Office.  “Through joint investigations with our law enforcement partners, DCIS aggressively pursues criminal prosecutions and all available remedies to bring violators to justice.  This guilty verdict demonstrate the effectiveness of our investigative efforts.”“The FDA is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to bring to justice those who place their personal gain over the health of American consumers,” said Peter Kuehl, Acting Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Office of Criminal Investigations, Miami Field Office‎.  “We commend the efforts of the Department of Justice for vigorously pursuing the prosecution of this matter.”“We are extremely pleased with the jury’s verdict in this case,” said Frank Robey, Director of the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command’s Major Procurement Fraud Unit.  “To in any way be culpable in swindling millions of dollars from a federal program that provides medical insurance for the U.S. military is completely unconscionable to me.  Agents from our specialized fraud unit, along with investigators from other federal law enforcement agencies, are unwavering in our commitment to seek out and hold responsible all those who conduct criminal activity against the United States Army and the American taxpayer.”Mr. Greenberg commended the investigative efforts of DCIS, FDA-OCI and U.S. Army CID.  This case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Kevin J. Larsen and Jon Juenger.Related court documents and information may be found on the website of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida atwww.flsd.uscourts.govor onhttp://pacer.flsd.uscourts.gov.Topic(s):Health Care FraudComponent(s):USAO - Florida, Southern"

Kirsch II, announced that Vahan Kelerchian, 58, of Richboro, Pennsylvania, doing business as Armament Services International \"ASI,\" was sentenced before Senior District Court Judge Joseph S. Van Bokkelen for his role in the acquisition of machineguns and restricted laser aiming sights.Kelerchian was sentenced to 100 months imprisonment, ordered to pay a $100,000 fine and $28,200 in restitution along with serving 1 year of supervised release upon release from prison.  Kelerchian was found guilty after a two-week trial that ended October 15, 2016.  Kelerchian was taken into custody upon sentencing to begin serving his sentence.According to evidence presented at trial, Kelerchian conspired with Joseph Kumstar and Ronald Slusser, now former Lake County Police Officers, to knowingly make false statements relating to the acquisition of firearms.  Kumstar and Slusser, who have plead guilty, used their positions as sworn law enforcement officers in coordination with Kelerchian using his position as a Class 3 Federal Firearms Licensee to acquire approximately 71 fully automatic machineguns in the name of the Lake County Sheriff’s Department knowing that the Lake County Sheriff’s Department was not going to be the true owner of these weapons.  Kelerchian, Kumstar and Slusser conspired to use law enforcement letter head to create letters which falsely represented that the machineguns were going to be used by the Lake County Sheriff’s Department to carry out its law enforcement responsibilities since machineguns manufactured after 1986 can only be acquired by law enforcement agencies and not individual officers.  The machineguns were purchased for a cost of $1200 and $1600 and then when received by the Sheriff’s Department, transported offsite to be parted out.  The barrels (also known as the “upper”) were split with the officers and some were sent back to Kelerchian.  The “uppers” sold between $3000 and $3600 due to post-1986 parts not being available to the public because only law enforcement agencies or the military can acquire these weapons.Kelerchian also used his company(Armament Services International “ASI”)to assist Kumstar and Slusser to acquire 74 restricted laser aiming sights again using law enforcement letterhead from the Lake County Sheriff’s Department and the Lowell Police Department.  These class 3b laser sights were restricted by the Food and Drug Administration.  These lasers were designed, per a variance from FDA, to be used for law enforcement and military use only because they did not have the audible or manual safety locks as required for class 3b lasers.  The laser aiming sights had a visible laser that could be seen in excess of 50 feet and an invisible laser that could be used for targeting with infrared goggles in excess of 1 mile.  Kelerchian along with the officers used their positions to acquire these devices and sell them to the general public or keep the devices for themselves.In addition to the charges above, Kelerchian was also found guilty of money laundering and false statements to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regarding false demonstration letters involving high powered belt-fed machine guns.  Kelerchian was also charged with bribery but was acquitted of that charge.United States Attorney Thomas L. Kirsch II said, “ Mr. Kelerchian abused the authority entrusted to him for criminal purposes.  The 8 years that he will spend in federal prison, which began today, should be a deterrent to others similarly situated that act for illegal purposes.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office will continue to aggressively prosecute our nation’s firearm laws and seek meaningful sentences of offenders to both punish and deter this type of criminal behavior.As reported previously, Joseph Kumstar was sentenced to 57 months; Edward Kabella was sentenced to 24 months; and Ronald Slusser was sentenced to 70 months for their involvement in this case.This case is a result of an investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Department of Defense Criminal Investigative Services; Federal Bureau of Investigation; Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations; and the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation Division.  This case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Philip C. Benson and Thomas M. McGrath.# # #Topic(s):Firearms OffensesPublic CorruptionComponent(s):USAO - Indiana, Northern"

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseJanuary 31, 2019United States Department of JusticeDistrict of MassachusettsBoston -- The former supervisory pharmacist of New England Compounding Center (NECC) was sentenced today in connection with the 2012 nationwide fungal meningitis outbreak that killed 64 and caused infections in 793 patients.Glenn Chin, 49, of Canton, Mass., was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Richard G. Stearns to eight years in prison, two years of supervised release, and forfeiture and restitution in an amount to be determined later. In October 2017, Chin was convicted by a federal jury in Boston of 77 counts, including racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud and mislead.“Mr. Chin was a pharmacist, but again and again he acted with complete disregard for the health and safety of patients,” said United States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling. “Mr. Chin will now be held responsible for producing contaminated drugs that killed dozens and grievously harmed over 750 people across the country. No patient should suffer harm at the hands of a medical professional, and we will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to combat fraud and abuse in the health care system.”“A key aspect of the FDA’s mission is to ensure that drugs are made under high quality conditions so that no patient is at risk of harm due to poorly compounded products,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “In response to episodes where patients were harmed by poorly compounded drugs, Congress passed a new set of laws to improve the FDA’s oversight of these products. We’re committed to the efficient, timely and robust implementation of that framework to help make sure patients can trust the reliability and safety of compounded drugs, recognize the benefits of pharmacy compounding, and that we protect consumers from harm.”“As a licensed pharmacist, Glenn Chin took an oath to protect his patients,” said Harold H. Shaw, Special Agent in Charge, FBI Boston Division. “In contrast, he failed miserably by cutting corners, ignoring warning signs, and harming hundreds of people with his reckless disregard for their safety.  Dozens of unsuspecting patients died because of the tainted drugs that were distributed on his watch.  Now, Mr. Chin is finally being held accountable for his role in one of the worst pharmaceutical disasters in this country. The FBI hopes today’s sentence will bring some comfort to the hundreds of victims and their families who have suffered so much.”In 2012, 753 patients in 20 states were diagnosed with a fungal infection after receiving injections of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) manufactured by NECC.  Of those 753 patients, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 64 patients in nine states died.  The government has since identified a total of 793 patients throughout the country harmed by NECC’s contaminated steroids.Chin manufactured three lots of contaminated MPA, which comprised more than 17,000 vials of medication. In doing so, Chin ignored NECC’s own drug formulation worksheets and standard operating procedures. Specifically, he improperly sterilized the MPA, failed to verify the sterilization process, and improperly tested it to ensure sterility. Despite knowing these deficiencies, Chin directed the MPA to be filled into thousands of vials and shipped to NECC customers nationwide.  During the fungal meningitis outbreak, the CDC identified 18 different types of fungi from MPA vials and patient samples.  In the words of one public health official, NECC was a “fungal zoo.”Chin directed the shipping of drugs prior to receiving test results confirming their sterility, and he directed NECC staff to mislabel drugs to conceal this practice. He also directed the compounding of drugs with expired ingredients, including chemotherapy drugs that had expired several years prior. Chin prioritized drug production over cleaning, directed the forging of cleaning logs, and routinely ignored mold and bacteria found inside the clean rooms. Lastly, for more than three years, Chin, along with co-conspirators, utilized a pharmacy technician whose license had been revoked by the Massachusetts Board of Pharmacy to compound highly sensitive cardiac drug solutions, and took steps to conceal the technician’s presence inside the clean room from state regulators.“One of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service’s (DCIS) priorities is toprotect the integrity of TRICARE, the U.S. Defense Department's health care program,” stated Special Agent in Charge Leigh-Alistair Barzey, DCIS Northeast Field Office. “Today’s sentencing demonstrates DCIS’ commitment to work with the USAO-MA, the FBI, the FDA-OCI and its other law enforcement partners, to identify, investigateand prosecute individuals who disregard pharmaceutical regulations and endanger the health and safety of U.S. military members, retirees and their families.‎”“The VA provides healthcare to those who have sacrificed so much for our country and fortunately no veterans receiving VA care were harmed by the fungal meningitis outbreak. However, it is appalling that NECC staff acted with such reckless disregard for patients by putting profits over safety,” said Special Agent in Charge Sean J. Smith for the Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Inspector General.  “The VA Office of Inspector General is honored to work with our partners in law enforcement on such an important investigation and assist in bringing those individuals who were responsible to justice.”“The sentence imposed today on Glenn Chin demonstrates the commitment of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and our law enforcement partners, to the safety and health of the American public,” said Raymond Moss, Acting Inspector in Charge of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Boston Division.  “Chin’s actions as a supervising pharmacist jeopardized the health of many patients and we will continue to investigate and take action against those who take part in this type of egregious behavior.”U.S. Attorney Lelling, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb, M.D., FBI SAC Shaw, DCIS SAC Barzey, VA OIG SAC Smith, and Acting Inspector in Charge of USPIS Moss made the announcement today.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys George P. Varghese and Amanda P.M. Strachan of Lelling’s Health Care Fraud Unit prosecuted the case.###"

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseSeptember 25, 2017United States Department of JusticeNorthern District of AlabamaBIRMINGHAM – The U.S. Attorney’s Office today charged the former lead technician at a central Alabama pharmacy with tampering with vials of opioid painkillers used in the compounding of intravenous fluid bags intended for hospice and homecare patients. U.S. Attorney Jay E. Town, Drug Enforcement Administration Assistant Special Agent in Charge Bret Hamilton and Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, Special Agent in Charge Justin D. Green announced the charge.Prosecutors filed a one-count information charging JOHNATHON WILLIAM CLICK with tampering with consumer products in reckless disregard for the risk that another person would be placed in danger of death or bodily injury, and under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to that risk. Between December 2014 and September 2016, Click, 30, of Bessemer, removed morphine sulfate and hydromorphone hydrochloride from vials intended for use in mixing IV bags. Click replaced the drugs with another liquid, knowing the diluted vials would be dispensed to patients, according to the charge.In conjunction with the information, prosecutors also filed a plea agreement with Click in U.S. District Court. According to the plea agreement, Click worked at Birmingham-based ContinuumRx of Central Alabama. CRX primarily distributes IV bags containing morphine and hydromorphone for palliative care.  Click, as the lead pharmacy technician, prepared the vast majority of CRX’s IV bags until the company ended his employment in September 2016.“This defendant was willing to subject terminal cancer patients to intolerable pain in order to feed his own addiction,” Town said. “This is one more aspect of the epidemic problem America has with abuse of prescription opioids. It also is a testament to law enforcement’s commitment to fight the illegal diversion of these drugs. In this case, people who desperately needed the prescribed drugs for their intended purpose of controlling intense and prolonged pain instead suffered at the hands of a man who knew the misery he could cause.“It is disappointing when assumed professionals, like pharmacy technicians, are engaged in the diversion of controlled substances,” Hamilton said. “Anyone who can deliberately deny medication to legitimate patients and violate their duties as a professional will be held accountable for allowing these good medicines to get into the wrong hands. The charge and plea agreement in this case are the result of DEA’s continued commitment to work with our law enforcement partners and hold accountable those who participate in illegally diverting controlled substances in our communities,” Hamilton said.“FDA is fully committed to the vigorous criminal investigation and prosecution of any individual who threatens the safety and security of the U.S. drug supply,” Green said. “The plea agreement in this case sends a clear signal that this kind of illicit tampering activity will not be tolerated.”According to the plea agreement, Click diverted quantities of morphine and hydromorphone from CRX’s locked inventory by surreptitiously removing vials, withdrawing drugs from the vials and replacing the withdrawn amount with saline or sterile water. He subsequently would return the adulterated and diluted vials to the inventory, undetected, and later used those vials to compound IV bags that were distributed and administered to homecare and hospice patients. CRX’s primary customers are Alacare Home Health & Hospice, New Beacon Hospice, Lakeview Homecare & Hospice, Comfort Care Hospice and Kindred Hospice.Former patients or family members of patients treated at any of those homecare or hospice providers between December 2014 and September 2016 may receive updates on the case by visiting the U.S. Attorney’s Office website athttp://www.justice.gov/usao-ndal/us-v-johnathon-william-clickor calling the toll-free number: 1-866-480-8230.The maximum penalty for tampering with consumer products is 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Click must appear before a federal judge to formally enter a guilty plea.DEA, FDA and the Alabama Board of Pharmacy investigated the case, which Assistant U.S. Attorney Mohammad Khatib is prosecuting.Component(s):USAO - Alabama, Northern"

Customers paid for the steroids through financial institutions like Western Union and MoneyGram. Members of the conspiracy used false identifications and multiple financial locations to pick up the proceeds.

Martez Alando Gurley, 41, and Victor Lamar Coates, 47, admitted they each trafficked more than 10,000 counterfeit tablets.Today, U.S. District Judge David Hittner sentenced Gurley to 75 months in federal prison and ordered him to pay $410,508 in restitution to Pfizer Inc. and Eli Lilly and Company - the licensed patent trademark holders of Viagra and Cialis. Coates received a sentence of 46 months and must pay $314,565 in restitution. Each defendant must also serve three years of supervised release following completion of their prison terms.“The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is charged with ensuring that prescription drugs distributed to U.S. consumers are safe and effective.

Morrison of the FDA - Office of Criminal Investigations’ (OCI) Kansas City Field Office. “Our office will continue to pursue and bring to justice those whose quest for profits places the public’s health at risk through the distribution of illegitimate drugs.”Gurley was convicted of trafficking at least 12,960 counterfeit Viagra and counterfeit Cialis tablets from his home in Napa, California, while Coates was convicted of trafficking at least 10,288 counterfeit Viagra and counterfeit Cialis tablets from his home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Both defendants sold the counterfeit drugs to individuals in the Houston area for further distribution to unsuspecting customers. Gurley and Coates illegally imported the counterfeit into the United States from sources in China.Testing on samples of the counterfeit Viagra revealed the drugs contained less than the 100 mg of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) listed on the labels, while testing on the counterfeit Cialis revealed small quantities of the Viagra API and none of the Cialis API. In addition, some of the counterfeit Viagra tablets were found to contain the unrelated compound 2-MBT. The counterfeit Viagra and Cialis tablets looked like the authentic products and included labels and packaging that closely resembled the registered trademarks of Eli Lilly and Company, and Pfizer Inc.In arriving at the sentences, Judge Hittner considered the fact that the illegally imported counterfeit drugs did not contain the correct medication indicated on the labelling and could cause harm to unsuspecting consumers of the pills.Gurley was immediately taken into custody following the hearing pending transfer to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future, while Coates was permitted to remain on bond and voluntarily surrender at a later date.The FDA - OCI and Homeland Security Investigations conducted the investigations.

        "content": "NEWPORT NEWS, Va. – Jayson Mickle, 31, of Hampton, was sentenced today to 210 months in prison for conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute controlled substances and controlled substance analogues.Mickle pleaded guilty on June 27, 2016. According to court documents, from 2008 to 2014, Mickle sold smokable synthetic cannabinoids, commonly known as “spice,” in the Hampton Roads area and, eventually, nationwide. Spice consists of plant material sprayed with ever changing active chemical ingredients often produced in clandestine laboratories in China. These chemicals mimic the effects of THC, the primary psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. Mickle sold blends of spice with names like Hampster Purp, HPT Cherry, Bizarro, and Orgazmo. Although the packets of spice were labeled “not for human consumption,” Mickle knew that the spice was to be smoked for its intoxicating properties.Mickle began sales through retail stores by the name of Hampton Pipe and Tobacco, located in Hampton, Newport News, Gloucester and Norfolk. In 2010, Mickle also began a wholesale operation online called Blazin Herbs. In 2013, the wholesale outfit’s name was changed to 7 City Gifts. At times, Mickle was supplied by Zencense, which was a large-scale spice producer and wholesaler based in Florida. Between January 2012 and April 2013, Mickle’s spice distribution operation purchased in excess of 1,000 kilograms of spice for resale from Zencense and its successor company, Zenbio, which was based in California. Mickle’s operations also supplied the Red Barn, a convenience store in Newport News, with spice in late 2013 into early 2014. From 2010 to 2012 alone, Mickle’s retail operation, Hampton Pipe and Tobacco, grossed over $9.6 million in spice sales. Mickle, who used a significant portion of his drug proceeds to purchase over two dozen real properties, was also ordered to forfeit those properties.Dana J.

Onyx, now owned by Amgen Inc., is a legitimate pharmaceutical company that does not manufacture steroids.The defendants allegedly sold the steroids to customers across the United States using email and social media platforms, collected payment through money remitters, such as Western Union and MoneyGram, and used false identifications and multiple remitter locations to pick up the proceeds.  Some of the defendants laundered proceeds from the steroid sales through Wicked Tan LLC, a tanning business located in Beverly, which they owned and operated specifically to launder the proceeds of the steroid operation.The charges of conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit drugs and conspiracy to distribute controlled substances provide for a sentence of no greater than five years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss of the conspiracy.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseDecember 8, 2016United States Department of JusticeDistrict of MassachusettsBOSTON – Several pharmaceutical executives and managers, formerly employed by Insys Therapeutics, Inc., were arrested today on charges that they led a nationwide conspiracy to bribe medical practitioners to unnecessarily prescribe a fentanyl-based pain medication and defraud healthcare insurers.The indictment alleges that Michael L. Babich, 40, of Scottsdale, Ariz., the former CEO and President of the company; Alec Burlakoff, 42, of Charlotte, N.C., former Vice President of Sales; Richard M. Simon, 46, of Seal Beach, Calif., former National Director of Sales; former Regional Sales Directors, Sunrise Lee, 36, of Bryant City, Mich. and Joseph A. Rowan, 43, of Panama City, Fla.; and former Vice President of Managed Markets, Michael J. Gurry, 53, of Scottsdale, Ariz., conspired to bribe practitioners in various states, many of whom operated pain clinics, in order to get them to prescribe a fentanyl-based pain medication.  The medication, called “Subsys,” is a powerful narcotic intended to treat cancer patients suffering intense episodes of breakthrough pain.  In exchange for bribes and kickbacks, the practitioners wrote large numbers of prescriptions for the patients, most of whom were not diagnosed with cancer.The indictment also alleges that the now former corporate executives charged in the case conspired to mislead and defraud health insurance providers who were reluctant to approve payment for the drug when it was prescribed for non-cancer patients.  They achieved this goal by setting up the “reimbursement unit” which was dedicated to obtaining prior authorization directly from insurers and pharmacy benefit managers.“Patient safety is paramount and prescriptions for these highly addictive drugs, especially Fentanyl, which is among the most potent and addictive opioids, should be prescribed without the influence of corporate money,” said United States Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz.  “I hope that today’s charges send a clear message that we will continue to attack the opioid epidemic from all angles, whether it is corporate greed or street level dealing.”“As alleged, top executives of Insys Therapeutics, Inc. paid kickbacks and committed fraud to sell a highly potent and addictive opioid that can lead to abuse and life threatening respiratory depression,” said Harold H. Shaw, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Field Division.  “In doing so, they contributed to the growing opioid epidemic and placed profit before patient safety.  These indictments reflect the steadfast commitment of the FBI and our law enforcement partners to confront the opioid epidemic impacting our communities, while bringing to justice those who seek to profit from fraud or other criminal acts.”“We take allegations of paying kickbacks to physicians in exchange for prescribing medically unnecessary painkillers extremely seriously,” said Special Agent in Charge Phillip Coyne of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General. “Working closely with our law enforcement partners, we will continue to protect the health of Medicare beneficiaries and the integrity of the nation’s healthcare system.”The defendants were arrested this morning in their respective states and will appear in U.S. District Court in Boston at a later date.  Babich is charged with conspiracy to commit racketeering, conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud and conspiracy to violate the Anti-Kickback Law; Burlakoff, Simon, Lee and Rowan are charged with RICO conspiracy, mail fraud conspiracy and conspiracy to violate the Anti-Kickback Law; Gurry is charged with RICO conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy.The indictment also alleges that the conspiracy to bribe practitioners and to defraud insurers generated substantial profits for the defendants, their company, and for the co-conspirator practitioners.“Causing the unnecessary use of opioids by current and retired U.S. military service members shows disregard for their health and disrespect for their service to our country,” said Special Agent in Charge Craig Rupert of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), Northeast Field Office.  “DCIS will continue to partner with the DOJ and our fellow law enforcement agencies to address conduct such as this and protect America's Warfighters.”“EBSA is very pleased to had the opportunity work collaboratively with our law enforcement partners in this important investigation,” said Susan A. Hensley, Regional Director of the U.S. Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security Administration, Boston Regional Office.“I commend the exceptional work performed by our criminal investigators and their law enforcement partners,” said Scott Rezendes, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Office of Inspector General, Office of Investigations.  “It is utterly unacceptable to risk the safety and well-being of patients in order to increase profits.  This office will continue to vigorously pursue any and all cases that may jeopardize the health of Federal employees, annuitants, and their families.”“U.S. Postal Inspection Service is committed to protecting the nation’s mail system from criminal misuse,” said Shelly Binkowski, Inspector in Charge of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.  “This investigation is an excellent example of a partnership between government agencies working together to dismantle prescription drug practices that directly contribute to the ongoing opioid abuse epidemic.”“The United States Postal Service, Office of Inspector General will continue to vigorously investigate companies that engage in improper relationships with medical providers for the purpose of increasing market share as alleged in this case,” said Eileen Neff, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General.  “We thank our law enforcement partners for their help in preventing this type of fraud against the healthcare programs of the American public and the Postal Service.”“Misrepresenting a patient's diagnoses and using kickbacks to prescribing doctors to inflate drug sales is fraudulent activity,” said Donna L. Neves, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Inspector General, Northeast Field Office.  “Targeting veterans’ dependents using CHAMPVA with these type techniques is unacceptable.  We are pleased to have contributed to this outstanding multi-agency criminal investigation and will continue to pursue allegations of health care fraud that put our veterans and their families at risk.”On the charges of conspiracy to commit RICO and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, the charging statute provides a sentence of no greater than 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000, or twice the amount of pecuniary gain or loss.  On the counts of conspiracy to violate the Anti-Kickback Law, the charging statute provides a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a $25,000 fine.  Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties.  Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.The investigation was conducted by a team that included the FBI; HHS-OIG; FDA Office of Criminal Investigations; the Defense Criminal Investigative Service; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security Administration; the Office of Personnel Management; the U.S. Postal Inspection Service; the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General; and the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The U.S. Attorney would like to acknowledge the outstanding cooperation and assistance of the U.S. Attorney’s Offices around the country engaged in parallel investigations, including the District of Connecticut; the Eastern District of Michigan; the Southern District of New York; and the Southern District of Alabama.  The efforts of the Central District of California and the Civil Fraud Section of the Department of Justice are also greatly appreciated.Assistant U.S. Attorneys K. Nathaniel Yeager, Chief of Ortiz’s Health Care Fraud Unit, and Susan M. Poswistilo, of Ortiz’ Civil Division, are prosecuting the case.The details contained in the indictment are allegations.  The defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.USAO - MassachusettsTopic:Healthcare Fraud"

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is in charge of the investigation.According to the information gathered during the investigation, liquid silicone is sometimes injected into the body to “augment” tissues, such as the buttocks or breasts. When intended for tissue augmentation, liquid silicone is a “device” under the FDCA, and is subject to FDA approval before it can legally be distributed and used for such use in the United States.  FDA has not approved any liquid silicone products for injection to augment tissues anywhere in the body.  In addition, the injection of liquid silicone into the body for tissue augmentation can result in serious adverse health consequences, including hardening of tissue at the injection site, embolization, and even death.On or about May 23, 2016, Puerto Rico Board of Health, Legal Division, contacted the FDA, San Juan Resident Office, to advise of a complainant who received medical procedures from a female individual who claimed to be a nurse. It was further indicated that the complainant received treatment to enlarge his/her buttocks and that the female individual was identified as “Rosa from Venezuela” (later identified as Rosa Betancourt-Farfán).The complainant was interviewed by FDA agents and indicated that she/he had been injected on both glutes one (1) vial by Betancourt-Farfán, for which he/she paid twelve hundred dollars ($1,200.00) in cash, but was having health problems during the summer of 2013. These problems consisted first with trouble breathing and back pain. His/her health condition worsened on or about 2015, when he/she was hospitalized with tendonitis and back spasms.A second victim indicated that he/she received treatment for butt augmentation with Betancourt-Farfán who had injected him/her with stem cells. According to the second victim, the first time he/she received the cosmetic treatment by the defendants, there were more than ten (10) individuals at a residence in Bayamón waiting to receive treatment. This second victim is presenting serious health issues and is receiving medical treatment with a doctor outside of Puerto Rico.“If you or a person you know have been treated by the defendant, please call the Junta de Licenciamiento y Disciplina Médica y Oficina de Reglamentación y Certificación de los Profesionales de la Salud al 787-765-2929, ext. 6589.  Your life is in danger if you have received any of these adulterated treatments,” stated Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, US Attorney for the District of Puerto Rico.This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Myriam Fernández. The case was investigated by the FDA.A criminal complaint is an accusation of criminal conduct, not evidence. A defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.USAO - Puerto RicoTopic:Consumer Protection"

The counterfeit marks were substantially indistinguishable from the marks of the United States domestic manufacturer of Newport brand cigarettes, which marks were then in use by and registered to that manufacturer on the principal register of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, all in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371.According to court records, including a Joint Factual Statement submitted by the parties, beginning in March 2015 and continuing through August 16, 2017, the defendants initiated contact with an individual cooperating with FDA-OCI, offering counterfeit cigarettes for sale. Through internet negotiations, an agreement was reached for a 20-foot container filled with counterfeit Newport brand cigarettes to be shipped from India to Miami.  Payment for the shipment was made in installments through international wire transfers to bank accounts in India and in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. On November 1, 2016, the container arrived and was seized at the Port of Miami with the assistance of U. S. Customs and Border Protection Officers. If distributed in the State of Florida, the un-taxed importation would have an approximate value of $1.2 million. Analysis conducted by FDA’s Forensic Chemistry Center determined that the cartons, packs, and cigarettes were all counterfeit.Within two weeks of the arrival, the coconspirators sought out FDA-OCI undercover agents offering another shipment, twice as large. By April 2017, deposits totaling $55,000 had been made for more counterfeit Newport cigarettes. On June 9, 2017, the container arrived at the Port of Miami and was again seized with the assistance of Customs and Border Protection Officers, and turned over to FDA-OCI Special Agents. If distributed in the State of Florida, the un-taxed importation would have an approximate value of $3.2 million.According to acts described in the conspiracy charge, Shukla and Panchal traveled to Miami in August 2017 to meet with the undercover agents to promote further business dealings. During the recorded meeting, they advised the agents that they had been partners for twelve years and personally oversaw the production of all the products being offered. They also assured the agents that they could counterfeit any American-made menthol cigarette with no problem, as well as other trademarked brands, and that they could produce tobacco blends, which would closely match the legitimate product.Shukla and Panchal each face potential prison sentences of up to five years imprisonment.  Additionally, they face possible fines of up to $250,000, followed by supervised release of up to five years.  Jubilee faces a fine of up to $500,000.  In its Plea Agreement, Jubilee agreed to forfeit $300,000, to the United States. Sentencing in this case is scheduled for February 12, 2018, at 2:00 p.m. before U.S. District Judge Kathleen M. Williams.Mr. Greenberg commended the investigative efforts of FDA OCI, ICE-HSI and BSO, for their assistance with this long-term investigation.  Mr. Greenberg also thanked U.S. Customs and Border Protection for their support.  This matter is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Watts-FitzGerald.Related court documents and information may be found on the website of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida athttp://www.flsd.uscourts.govor onhttp://pacer.flsd.uscourts.gov.Component(s):USAO - Florida, Southern"

Casey, 74, of Poquoson, is the owner and President of Casey’s Seafood, Inc. According to court documents, from at least July 2012 through June 2015, Casey knowingly conspired to replace Atlantic blue crab with crab meat from Indonesia, China, Thailand, Vietnam, and Central and South America. Casey and his co-conspirators falsely labeled at least 397,917 pounds of crab meat, with a retail value in the millions of dollars, as Atlantic blue crab and “Product of the United States”.According to court documents, Casey directed employees to remove foreign crabmeat from the original shipper’s packaging containers, blend and combine foreign crab meat from one processor with crab meat from another processor, and place it into different packing containers with a label declaring that the contents were a “Product of USA,” despite knowing that the contents were imported crab meat. Casey also directed employees to place labels with “Product of the USA” on containers that covered up labels that stated “Product of Brazil” or “Product of China”.Casey has been charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, and faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison, if convicted.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseSeptember 22, 2017United States Department of JusticeAegerion Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based subsidiary of Novelion Therapeutics Inc., has agreed to plead guilty to charges relating to its prescription drug, Juxtapid, the Justice Department announced today.As charged in a criminal information filed today, Aegerion introduced Juxtapid into interstate commerce that was misbranded because, among other things, Aegerion failed to comply with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS).  The resolution also includes a deferred prosecution agreement relating to criminal liability under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  In addition, Aegerion has agreed to settle allegations that it caused false claims to be submitted to federal health care programs for Juxtapid.  Aegerion has agreed to pay more than $35 million to resolve criminal and civil liability arising from these matters.  Aegerion has also agreed to enter into a civil consent decree of permanent injunction aimed at preventing future violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA).“Today’s settlement shows that the government will continue to hold accountable drug companies that violate laws designed to protect the health and safety of patients,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Chad A. Readler of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.  “Aegerion has agreed to plead guilty to breaking the law.  The Justice Department will continue to ensure that taxpayers do not foot the bill when such conduct occurs.”In a criminal information filed on Sept. 22 in the District of Massachusetts, the United States charged that, from December 2012 to December 2015, Aegerion introduced into interstate commerce Juxtapid, a drug that was misbranded under the FDCA.  During this time period, Juxtapid was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), a rare disorder, inherited from both parents, that prevents the removal of LDL-C, often called the “bad” cholesterol, from the blood, causing abnormally high levels of circulating LDL-C.  The Juxtapid label carried a black box warning that Juxtapid may cause liver toxicity, a serious side effect of using the drug, and the label also warned that Juxtapid may cause gastrointestinal adverse reactions.  FDA required a REMS, which is a  risk management plan deemed necessary to ensure that a drug’s benefits outweigh its risks, as part of Juxtapid’s approval.  The specific purpose of the Juxtapid REMS was to educate prescribers about the risks of liver toxicity and to restrict access to Juxtapid only to those patients with a clinical or laboratory diagnosis consistent with HoFH.The information alleges that during the relevant time period, Aegerion failed to give health care providers complete and accurate information about HoFH and how to properly diagnose it, and that Aegerion also filed a misleading REMS assessment report.  According to the information, Aegerion therefore failed to comply with the required elements under the REMS to assure safe use of Juxtapid, in violation of the FDCA.  The information further alleges that Aegerion management and sales personnel distributed Juxtapid not only for the treatment of HoFH, but also as a treatment for high cholesterol generally, without adequate directions for such use.  Under the terms of a plea agreement, Aegerion has agreed to plead guilty to these charges and pay a criminal fine and forfeiture of $7.2 million.In a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve a felony charge that Aegerion conspired to violate HIPAA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1320d-6(a) and 1320-6(b)(3), Aegerion admitted that it conspired to obtain patients’ personally identifiable health information, without patient authorization, for commercial gain.  Under the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement, Aegerion will implement enhanced compliance provisions, including periodic certifications to the government concerning its implementation of those provisions.Under the civil false claims settlement, Aegerion will pay $28.8 million over three years to resolve federal and state civil liability for causing false claims for Juxtapid to be submitted to government health care programs (Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE) arising from its promotion of Juxtapid for patients without a diagnosis of, or consistent with, HoFH; false and misleading statements to doctors that the use of Juxtapid was appropriate in patients with symptoms including high cholesterol, irrespective of whether such patients had a diagnosis of HoFH and despite counter-indications to a diagnosis of HoFH; and alteration or falsification of statements of medical necessity and prior authorizations that were submitted to federal health care programs.  The government further alleged that Aegerion defrayed patients’ copayment obligations for Juxtapid, in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS), by funneling funds through Patient Services Inc. (PSI), an entity that claimed to be a non-profit patient assistance organization.  The federal share of the $28.8 million civil false claims settlement is $26.1 million and the state portion is $2.7 million.“Aegerion put profits over patient safety and enriched itself at taxpayer expense,” said Acting U.S. Attorney William D. Weinreb for the District of Massachusetts.  “Our Office is committed to protecting patient safety and the integrity of federal health care programs, and we will continue to use our criminal and civil authority to ensure that drug companies play by the rules that protect the public, ensure quality of care, and preserve patient privacy.”As part of the resolution, Aegerion has agreed to enter into a separate civil consent decree to resolve civil liability under the FDCA in connection with its failure to comply with the requirements of the Juxtapid REMS program and its distribution of Juxtapid with labeling that lacked adequate directions for all of Juxtapid’s intended uses.  Aegerion also entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the HHS-OIG.  The five-year CIA requires, among other things, that Aegerion implement measures designed to ensure that its promotional activities and any arrangements and interactions with third-party patient assistance programs comply with the law.  In addition, the CIA requires reviews by an independent review organization and compliance-related certifications from company executives and Board members.“We sometimes require companies to put in place certain measures to more closely manage a drug’s risks when we don’t believe a medicine’s benefits would outweigh its side effects without these risk mitigation strategies,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “This might include requiring prescribers to undergo certain training on a drug’s risks, or having providers take steps to more closely monitor patients.  By failing to follow the safety requirements that Aegerion had agreed to, the company put patients’ lives at risk and didn’t honor the safety commitments they made as a condition of gaining approval for their drug. This is unacceptable. We will continue to pursue those who skirt the law, and flout patient safety and other post-market commitments, using all of the enforcement tools available to us. Post-market safety requirements are a key element of FDA’s public health protections and we will ensure that they are fulfilled.”“Today’s plea and settlement with Aegerion shows how the government will hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable for violating important FDA and privacy rules that are intended to keep patients safe and ensure the confidentiality of their information,” said Special Agent in Charge Harold H. Shaw of the FBI, Boston Field Division. “The FBI will continue to investigate companies like Aegerion that profit from exploiting patients who are searching for treatments for serious medical conditions.”“Our corporate integrity agreement increases individual accountability for board members and company executives and it requires Aegerion to strengthen controls around promotional activities and other interactions with health care providers,” said Chief Counsel to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Inspector General Gregory E. Demske.  “Importantly, the CIA also requires that Aegerion implement controls and monitoring designed to ensure true independence from any charity patient assistance programs to which it donates in the future.”“Today’s agreement demonstrates that we will not allow pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide the medical community with false and incomplete information about their products, thereby jeopardizing the health and safety of our citizens,” said Special Agent in Charge Phillip Coyne for the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG). “Nor will we allow corporations to profit at the expense of patient care and their personal information.”The civil false claims settlement resolves a lawsuit filed by Michele Clarke, Tricia Mullins, and Kristi Winger Szudlo, former employees of Aegerion, under the qui tam or whistleblower, provisions of the False Claims Act, which permit private individuals, known as relators, to sue on behalf of the government for false claims and to share in any recovery.  The qui tam suit was filed in the District of Massachusetts and is captioned United States ex rel. Clarke, et al. v. Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al., No. 13-CV-11785 (D. Mass.).  Relators will receive $4.7 million from the federal proceeds of the civil false claims settlement.The government’s resolution of this matter illustrates the government’s emphasis on combating health care fraud.  One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act.  Tips and complaints from all sources about potential fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement can be reported to the Department of Health and Human Services at 900-HHS-TIPS (800-447-8477).This resolution was the result of a coordinated effort by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts, the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch and Commercial Litigation Branch, the FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel and Office of Criminal Investigations, the FBI, HHS-OIG, and the Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration.Except as to conduct admitted as part of the guilty plea and deferred prosecution agreement, the claims resolved by the civil settlement are allegations only and there has been no determination of liability.Attachment(s):Download Aegerion Pharmaceuticals Information FDCADownload Aegerion Pharmaceuticals Plea AgreementDownload Aegerion Pharmaceuticals Information ConspiracyDownload Aegerion Pharmaceuticals DPADownload Aegerion Pharmaceuticals and Dr. Gerrits ComplaintTopic(s):False Claims ActComponent(s):Civil DivisionUSAO - MassachusettsPress Release Number:17-1044"

Reeves sentenced Samuel Girod, 57, for impeding an officer of the United States, obstruction of proceedings before an agency of the United States, witness tampering, failure to appear, and nine violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in connection with three products he made and distributed. Judge Reeves also ordered Girod to pay $14,239.08 in restitution to his customers, and imposed a term of supervised release of 3 years following his release from prison.“The essence of this case is found in two fundamental principles: protecting the public and ensuring the integrity of the judicial process,” said Carlton S. Shier, IV, Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky. “A federal jury convicted Mr. Girod of conduct that brazenly placed the public at risk, openly hampered law enforcement, and intentionally impeded the judicial process. The interests of everyone are served when criminal conduct undermining these principles is confronted and prosecuted.”At his trial in March of this year, the evidence established that Girod had been manufacturing and selling homemade products to businesses in numerous states and that the products did not comply with FDA regulations. Specifically, one of his products was dangerous when used in the manner recommended and all three were advertised in a way that did not comply with the law.In 2013, a federal judge in Missouri ordered Girod to stop manufacturing and selling his products, until his labeling and advertisement of the products met FDA regulations. Despite the court order, Girod continued to manufacture these products and sell them in Indiana, Wisconsin and Illinois, marketing them in the exact same manner as he had before the court order.The evidence further established that, as part of the 2013 order, the judge required inspections of Girod’s facility in Bath County, to ensure his compliance with the order. In November 2013, two FDA Consumer Safety Officers attempted to conduct the court-ordered inspection of Girod’s facility, but they were prevented from conducting the inspection by Girod and others on his property.Then, after the criminal case against him began, Girod tampered with a witness, failed to appear for court proceedings, and was a fugitive for several months.Acting United States Attorney Shier and Mark McCormack, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, jointly announced the sentence. The case was investigated by the FDA, Office of Criminal investigations, and the United States Marshals Service. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kate K.

Quesada was arrested in Madrid, Spain, earlier this year. He was extradited to the United States yesterday.According to the indictment, Quesada used a Costa Rican website to advertise the Internet sale of Schedule II and IV controlled substances and erectile dysfunction drugs, which were exported from India and received in the United States by co-defendants Sylvia and Miguel Cruz. The latter two then mailed the drugs to U.S. consumers who had ordered them through the Costa Rican website. The consumers were falsely led to believe that the drugs were “FDA approved,” that the counterfeit drugs were genuine Adderall and Viagra, and that it was legitimate to distribute such drugs without prescriptions.\"Ordering prescription drugs online from illegal websites can lead to dangerous consequences for U.S. consumers.

A federal jury convicted Tamara Mitchell Nov. 9, 2016, following a three-day trial.“The public expects that the prescription drugs they receive are pursuant to valid prescriptions that are based on a legitimate medical need,” said Special Agent in Charge Spencer E. Morrison of the Food and Drug Administration - Office of Criminal Investigation, (FDA-OCI) Kansas City Field Office. “Our office will continue to pursue and to bring to justices those who jeopardize the public health by engaging in fraudulent schemes to dispense prescription drugs.”Today, U.S. District Judge Nancy Atlas ordered Mitchell to prison for a total of 14 years to be immediately followed by three years of supervised release. At the hearing, the court heard additional evidence that one of the individuals who received the creams died from Ketamine and Cyclobenzaprine toxicity. Both substances were active ingredients in the creams Mitchell sold. In handing down the sentence, Judge Atlas noted the vast nature of the fraud scheme was one of the worst she had seen in 22 years on the bench.During trial, the jury heard evidence demonstrating Mitchell was an owner of two pharmacies, Diamond and Save Rite, that sold creams containing controlled substances as part of a marketing scheme rather than for legitimate medical need. Both pharmacies sold these compounded creams containing Ketamine to the public by using pre-signed prescriptions to fill orders for customers who had the “right” insurance plans. The individuals who received the creams were never examined by a doctor and the submissions to the insurance providers contained misrepresentations regarding the medical need.Mitchell hired a pharmacy technician and pharmacist to conduct the day-to-day operations of the business, while another pharmacist marketed the creams to anyone with an insurance plan that would pay. Diamond Pharmacy paid a physician and nurse practitioner thousands of dollars per month to pre-sign prescription pads without examining patients. Under Mitchell’s direction, Diamond and Save Rite falsely billed insurance companies for more than $17 million in just two years.Mitchell will remain in custody pending transfer to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future.The FDA-OCI and Drug Enforcement Administration conducted the investigation.

Arif falsely represented that the drugs were being sold by entities in Germany, Norway, Italy, Australia, New Zealand and Denmark when in fact the drugs were all being sold and shipped from Pakistan. Arif used those false addresses to make customers more comfortable purchasing the drugs. Documents in the case show that Arif ‘s scheme generated more than $12 million in fraudulent sales.Arif was originally arrested on a criminal complaint issued in New Hampshire after he flew into New York in February 2014 on a business trip.  He appeared in federal court in New York and was transferred to New Hampshire, where he has remained in custody.

Jubilee faces a fine of up to $500,000 on Count 1 and Pelican faces a possible fine of $500.000 per Count.  This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Kathleen M. Williams.According to court records, including allegations contained in the indictment, beginning as early as March 2015 and continuing through August 16, 2017, the defendants initiated contact with an individual cooperating with FDA-OCI, offering counterfeit cigarettes for sale. Through internet negotiations, agreement was reached for a 20-foot container to be shipped from India to Miami, Florida, laden with counterfeit Newport brand cigarettes. Payment for the shipment was made in installments through international wire transfers to bank accounts in India and in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. On November 1, 2016, the container arrived in the USA and was seized with the assistance of United States Customs and Border Protection Officers at the Port of Miami. If distributed in the State of Florida, the un-taxed importation would have an approximate value of $1.2 million. Analysis conducted by FDA’s Forensic Chemistry Center concluded that the cartons, packs, and cigarettes were all counterfeit.Within two weeks of the arrival, the coconspirators sought out the undercover agents offering another shipment, twice as large. By April 2017, deposits totaling $55,000 had been made to accounts in the name of Pelican for counterfeit Newport cigarettes. On June 9, 2017, the container arrived at the Port of Miami and was seized with the assistance of United States Customs and Border Protection Officers, and turned over to FDA Special Agents. If distributed in the State of Florida, the un-taxed importation would have an approximate value of $3.2 million.According to acts described in the conspiracy charge, Shukla and Panchal travelled to Miami in August 2017 to meet with the undercover agents in order to promote further business dealings. During the recorded meeting, they advised the agents that they had been partners for twelve years and personally oversaw the production of all the product being offered. They also assured the agents that they could counterfeit any American-made menthol cigarette with no problem, as well as other trademarked brands and that they could produce tobacco blends which would closely match the legitimate product.An indictment merely contains accusations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.Mr. Greenberg commended the investigative efforts of FDA OCI, ICE-HSI and BSO, for their assistance with this long-term investigation.  Mr. Greenberg also thanked U.S. Customs and Border Protection for their support.  This matter is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Thomas Watts-FitzGerald of the Economic & Environmental Crimes Section.Related court documents and information may be found on the website of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida atwww.flsd.uscourts.govor onhttp://pacer.flsd.uscourts.gov."

Their products contained XLR-11 and UR-144, which at that time were analogues of JWH-018, a Schedule I controlled substance. In December 2012, Ritchie and Galecki purported to sell their company to a third party in California, though they continued to exercise control over the company into 2013. The new company’s name was ZenBio.Between August 2012 and April 2013, Zencense and ZenBio shipped a total of approximately 1,000 kilograms of spice to the Hampton Roads area.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseDecember 20, 2016United States Department of JusticeDistrict of MassachusettsDefendant admits NECC created fraudulent prescriptions to avoid federal oversightBOSTON – The National Sales Director for New England Compounding Center (NECC), a compounding pharmacy located in Framingham, Mass., pleaded guilty yesterday in U.S. District Court in Boston in connection with conspiring to defraud the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Robert A. Ronzio, 42, of North Providence, R.I., pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to defraud the FDA.  U.S. District Court Judge Richard G. Stearns scheduled sentencing for Sept. 27, 2017.  Ronzio is cooperating with the government and is expected to testify at the trials of the other NECC defendants.Ronzio admitted that NECC was a pharmacy dispensing drugs pursuant to physician-created prescriptions when in fact it operated as a manufacturer distributing drugs in bulk.  NECC created numerous work-around methods to make it appear to federal and state regulators that NECC was dispensing drugs pursuant to valid patient-specific prescriptions when in fact it was not.Specifically, Ronzio admitted that NECC sales representatives requested that customers send in a list of patient names with their orders, but informed the customers that NECC would not label the drugs with the names of patients, thereby allowing the customers to use the drugs for any patients.  Ronzio further admitted that NECC sales representatives requested customers send patient rosters or appointment schedules with their orders, from which NECC employees created patient-specific prescriptions that could be provided to federal or state regulators.  Furthermore, NECC would not request patient names for first orders, and often waived the requirement entirely for certain customers or drug orders.  To determine the number of patient names required, NECC owner and head pharmacist Barry J. Cadden is alleged to have created ratios of patient names to the number of drug units sought in an order.  Cadden explained to Ronzio, “The MAX total number of units (vials, syringes, etc..) per patient must make sense.  I must be able to logically explain to a regulator why we processed x# of units per patient.”  Ronzio admitted the reason for these work-around methods was to maintain NECC’s status as a pharmacy and avoid heightened regulatory oversight of the FDA.The NECC criminal case arose from the nationwide outbreak of fungal meningitis that was traced back to contaminated vials of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) manufactured by NECC.  The outbreak was the largest public health crisis caused by a pharmaceutical product.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 751 patients in 20 states were diagnosed with a fungal infection after receiving injections of NECC’s MPA.  Of those 751 patients, the CDC reported that 64 patients in nine states died.  The government’s investigation has revealed that those numbers continue to rise.In December 2014, following a two-year investigation, Ronzio and 13 other owners, employees, and associates of NECC were charged in a 131-count indictment.  The indictment did not charge Ronzio with having an active role in the drug manufacturing operations of NECC, but did charge him with conspiring to defraud the FDA.Cadden and supervisory pharmacist Glenn A. Chin were charged with 25 racketeering acts of second-degree murder in seven states.  Eleven other defendants, including six pharmacists, the director of operations, an unlicensed pharmacy technician, and three other owners and executives were charged with additional crimes including racketeering, mail fraud, conspiracy, violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and structuring.  Cadden is scheduled to stand trial on Jan. 5, 2017.United States Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz; Jeffrey Ebersole, Special Agent in Charge of the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, New York Field Office; Harold H. Shaw, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Field Division; Donna Neves, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Inspector General, Northeast Field Office; Craig Rupert, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Department of Defense, Office of Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Northeast Field Office; and Shelly Binkowski, Inspector in Charge of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, made the announcement today.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys George P. Varghese and Amanda P.M. Strachan of Ortiz’s Health Care Fraud Unit and John W.M.

Mountcastle announced.After one and one-half hours, a federal jury sitting in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia in Abingdon found Sitesh Bansi Patel, 33, of Irvine, California guilty of one count of conspiracy to defraud the FDA, one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and three counts of mail fraud. At sentencing, Patel faces up to 85 years in prison, a fine of up to $1.25 million and the potential forfeiture of assets acquired through criminal behavior.In a separate hearing Friday, a co-conspirator in the matter, Guillermo “Willy” Ramos, 41, of Oceanside, California, was sentenced to two years’ probation for his role in the conspiracy. Steven Donald Wood, 38, of Danville, Virginia, was previously sentenced to probation for a term of one year and ordered to forfeit $1.5 million, which was paid prior to Wood pleading guilty. Wood was also ordered to pay a $10,000 fine.According to evidence presented during last week’s trial, Patel was the vice president of SK Labs, a California-based supplement manufacturer. Patel has a Pharm.D degree. In 2008 and 2009, Patel used SK Labs to produce H-Drol and M-Drol for Steve Wood’s company Competitive Edge Labs. The products labeled M-Drol and H-Drol contained prohormones. The products were misbranded because the labels identified them as “dietary supplements” when, in fact, they were drugs. The active ingredients in H-Drol and M-Drol are now classified by the DEA as anabolic steroids. In 2009, when it became widely known in the supplement industry that these types of products were being actively investigated by the FDA, SK Labs quit producing H-Drol and M-Drol. However, beginning in December 2010, Patel arranged for Steve Wood, who was a significant customer of SK Labs, to meet Willy Ramos, of Oceanside, California, via email so that Ramos could begin producing H-Drol and M-Drol for Steve Wood. Patel received, at his home, the first shipments of the raw powders, labels, and payment from Wood. On more than one occasion, Patel transported those items to a shopping mall parking lot where he delivered them to Ramos. Ramos encapsulated, bottled, and labeled the H-Drol and M-Drol on several occasions. Patel arranged for the first shipment of finished product to be sent to Wood in the Danville, Virginia, area. Patel was paid by Ramos and Wood for his role. Wood testified he sent Patel $8,000 to $10,000 in cash on at least two occasions. The cash was sent in supplement bottles. Ramos testified that he paid Patel $7,500 in cash. Ramos quit producing the products when Steve Wood was arrested on September 14, 2011, in the Danville, Virginia, area.Wood obtained his raw powder from Xinli “Eric” Li, a Chinese national, who pleaded guilty in federal court in Abingdon on December 4, 2015. Li forfeited $1.6 million and served five months in prison prior to being deported to China.M-Drol listed its single active ingredient as 2a, 17a di methyl etiocholan 3-one, 17b-ol, a chemical nomenclature for methasterone, also known as “Superdrol.” The FDA has identified methasterone as a “designer steroid” or “designer drug”, a structural or functional analog of a controlled substance designed to mimic the pharmacological effects of the original drug. H-Drol listed its single active ingredient as 4-chloro-17a-methyl-androst-1,4-diene-3-17b-diol, the nomenclature for a designer drug identified as halovar, a clone of halodrol. Both products were deemed to be misbranded drugs because the label was false, that is, the product was labeled as a “dietary supplement” but contained a “steroid” or drug. Therefore, neither product met the definition of a dietary supplement. Both products were popular among those seeking an increase in muscle mass and loss of body fat and were distributed widely in the U.S. and overseas, both at retail stores and via the internet. The use of anabolic steroids or dietary supplements that contain anabolic steroids or designer steroids may trigger numerous adverse health effects in the human body.The investigation, known as Operation Grasshopper, has resulted in the forfeiture of over $3 million and felony convictions for seven different individuals from Virginia, California, Florida, New York and China.The investigation was conducted by the United States Food and Drug Administration – Office of Criminal Investigations. The Pittsylvania County Sheriff’s Office provided valuable assistance in the case. Assistant United States Attorney Randy Ramseyer prosecuted the case for the United States.USAO - Virginia, Western"

Neronha, George M. Karavetsos, Director, FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, and Kristina O’Connell, Acting Special Agent in Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation.At sentencing, U.S. District Court Judge John J. McConnell, Jr., also ordered Feijo to serve 3 years supervised release and to pay restitution in the amount of $218,408.04 owed to the IRS. Feijo pleaded guilty on September 11, 2015, to introduction of a new unapproved drug and tax evasion.“People facing difficult, even life-threatening, health challenges are often susceptible to the kinds of deceptive schemes cooked up by the defendant here,” said United States Attorney Peter F. Neronha. “Whether in this context or in others, those who prey on the hopes and fears of the most vulnerable deserve the full attention of law enforcement.  A stretch in federal prison is more than appropriate for this defendant. The people who relied on his greed-motivated, baseless claims of ‘cure’ deserved much better.”“The FDA’s drug approval process ensures that patients receive safe and effective medications,” said George M. Karavetsos, Director, FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations. “When criminals evade the FDA process and sell their non-FDA approved products to our most vulnerable consumers, we will take action to protect the public’s health.”At the time of his guilty plea, Feijo admitted to the court that he engaged in the marketing, sale and distribution of unapproved cancer treatment health products and supplements which were not generally recognized as safe and effective for use by the FDA. Additionally, the products, as marketed, were not generally recognized as safe and effective by qualified experts for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of cancer. The products were marketed and sold through various websites, in-store advertisements, a call center, on Feijos’ daily radio program, and through the use of promotional materials and publications.In addition, at the time of his guilty plea, Feijo admitted to the court that from 2006 through 2011, he falsely represented to Daniel Chapter One employees that they were independent contractors, when in truth they were employees of Daniel Chapter One. During that time, Feijo failed to issue IRS Wage and Tax Statements accounting for employees’ wages and taxes withheld. Feijo admitted that Daniel Chapter One employees were paid by checks written out to cash, and that for at least sixteen quarters he failed to collect, account for and pay over employment taxes due the IRS totaling $218,408.04.“Business owners like Mr. Feijo have an important responsibility to collect and turn over all withholding taxes,” said Kristina O’Connell, IRS Criminal Investigation Acting Special Agent in Charge. “Those who fail to do so gain a competitive advantage which will not be tolerated.  Employment tax fraud also impacts employees, who may see future benefits such as Social Security reduced because their employer did not comply with the law.\"The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Terrence P. Donnelly.The matter was investigated by the Rhode Island FDA Task Force and IRS Criminal Investigation.###"

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseJune 2, 2016United States Department of JusticeMiddle District of PennsylvaniaHARRISBURG - The United States Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania announced today that a federal grand jury brought additional criminal charges yesterday against a thoroughbred horse trainer already under indictment for wire fraud and criminal conspiracy.According to United States Attorney Peter Smith, Murray L. Rojas, age 50, of Grantville, Pennsylvania was charged in a 21 count superseding indictment with additional charges relating to the dispensing of misbranded drugs and criminal conspiracy. Rojas was previously indicted in August 2015 on charges of wire fraud and criminal conspiracy for conduct related to 11 races in which she had horses entered at Penn National Race Course in early 2013. Two additional wire fraud charges were brought relating to two additional races bringing the total to 13 races.In addition to the misbranded drug distribution charges, the indictment also expands the time frame for the wire fraud conspiracy to at least 2009 and identifies additional races in which Rojas allegedly had prohibited substances administered to the horses. The superseding indictment alleges that Rojas directed and conspired with unnamed and unindicted coconspirator veterinarian(s) to administer substances to horses on the day they were entered to race, in violation of the criminal laws of Pennsylvania and the racing rules and regulations prohibiting the administering of those substances.The indictment also alleges that steps were taken to conceal this conduct by the backdating of invoices for the sale and administration of drugs to the horses on race day, as well as the submission of fraudulent veterinarian treatment reports to the Pennsylvania Horse Racing Commission.The purse money for the races is funded by the interstate electronic transfer of funds and, therefore, the involvement of the transmission of these funds that are used to pay successful owners/trainers is essential to the alleged scheme to defraud. The superseding indictment now alleges that Rojas won a total of $124,756 from the races in which it is alleged she directed the administration of prohibited substances to her horses.“As with human prescription drugs, veterinary prescription drugs may only be administered under the supervision of a licensed medical professional” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Office. “The FDA works to ensure that prescription drugs used on our animals are safe and effective, and issued with a valid prescription. When that does not happen, we will take action.”The case was investigated by the by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture’s Horse Racing Commission and the Federal Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations. Prosecution is assigned to Assistant United States Attorney William A. Behe.Indictments are only allegations. All persons charged are presumed to be innocent unless and until found guilty in court.A sentence following a finding of guilt is imposed by the Judge after consideration of the applicable federal sentencing statutes and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.The maximum penalty under federal law is 20 years of imprisonment on the wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud counts. The counts alleging the distribution of misbranded drugs and conspiracy to do so are each punishable by up to 3 years in prison. A term of supervised release following imprisonment and a fine are also part of the possible sentence. Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the Judge is also required to consider and weigh a number of factors, including the nature, circumstances and seriousness of the offense; the history and characteristics of the defendant; and the need to punish the defendant, protect the public and provide for the defendant's educational, vocational and medical needs. For these reasons, the statutory maximum penalty for the offense is not an accurate indicator of the potential sentence for a specific defendant.# # #USAO - Pennsylvania, Middle"

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseSeptember 5, 2017United States Department of JusticeDistrict of New HampshireCONCORD, N.H. –Acting United States Attorney John J. Farley announced that two residents of New Ipswich, New Hampshire have pleaded guilty to charges that they conspired to distribute misbranded drugs that they obtained from India.John Hayes, 53, pleaded guilty today to conspiring to introduce misbranded drugs into interstate commerce. His wife, Plabplueng Hayes, 50, pleaded guilty to the same charge on August 23, 2017.According to court documents and statements in court, the defendants conspired with an unindicted co-conspirator in India, and with John Hayes’ brother (James Hayes) and sister-in-law Shannon Hayes) in North Carolina to receive shipments from India (often three to five shipments per week) that contained, in the aggregate, hundreds of thousands of pills. These pills were then sold to various customers. James Hayes and Shannon Hayes have each pleaded guilty to related charges in North Carolina.During the course of the conspiracy, United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP), seized more than 60 shipments from India addressed to John Hayes for delivery at his residence and at multiple Post Office boxes in southern New Hampshire and northern Massachusetts. Those seized shipments were found to contain more than 100,000 pills. The pills were all packaged in blister packs with no packaging that a person would recognize as retail-type packaging, and with no directions under which a layman could use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it was intended. Testing showed that thousands of the pills were prescription drugs and controlled substances. In addition, CBP sent letters to John Hayes at the Hayes residence advising him that the seizures occurred because the drugs were imported contrary to federal regulations that prohibit the importation of controlled substances without the express authorization of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).Postal Service and PayPal records also showed that an email account that was used by both defendants sent more than 5,000 packages to locations throughout the United States, including outside of New Hampshire, between February 2012 and September 2013. The email account also was used by both defendants to manage and confirm the receipt of drugs from India, to receive and track customer orders for drugs, and to coordinate payments.A search warrant executed at the Hayes residence in New Ipswich resulted in the seizure of more than 100,000 pills, including prescription drugs and controlled substances, as well as shipping labels and empty shipping containers, and other documents. Among these documents were two letters from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) informing John Hayes that tramadol tablets shipped to him were being refused entry into the United States because the drugs appeared to be unapproved and misbranded.Plabplueng Hayes will be sentenced on November 28, 2017 and John Hayes will be sentenced on December 12, 2017.“The importation and sale of misbranded drugs presents a serious threat to the community,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Farley. “Consumers who purchase such drugs cannot be confident that the products that they are using have been manufactured under appropriate and sanitary conditions. Ingesting such pills can lead to unexpected and dangerous consequences. I appreciate the hard work of the law enforcement agents in this case who identified and dismantled this dangerous operation.”“Sending illegal prescription drugs into the U.S. marketplace puts consumers’ health at risk,” said Jeffrey J. Ebersole, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ New York Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who jeopardize the public’s health.”This case was investigated by FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Arnold Huftalen and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Sarah Hawkins, who is Senior Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel, U.S. Food and Drug Administration.###Topic(s):Prescription DrugsComponent(s):USAO - New Hampshire"

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseMarch 14, 2017United States Department of JusticeNorthern District of GeorgiaATLANTA - Deanna Roberts has pleaded guilty to four felony counts of possessing, transporting, and ultimately illegally injecting persons with liquid silicone and four felony counts of introducing into interstate commerce liquid silicone, which was an adulterated device. One of the women the defendant injected with liquid silicone died about 36 hours after receiving the injection when the silicone migrated to her lungs, heart, brain, and other organs.“Roberts admitted that she caused the death of one person by injecting her with liquid silicone, and that she also injected liquid silicone into multiple other people, putting their lives at considerable risk,” said U. S. Attorney John Horn. “Before undergoing any type of medical procedure, patients should ensure they have consulted a licensed medical provider who is qualified to provide care.”“Liquid silicone injected into individuals’ bodies can cause serious bodily injury and death, and FDA has not approved any such product for tissue augmentation,” said Justin D. Green, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Miami Field Office. “We remain fully committed to bringing to justice those who offer dangerous and unapproved products to American consumers.”According to U.S. Attorney Horn, the indictment, and other information presented in court: Between April 2004 and December 2015, Roberts purchased at least 178 gallons of liquid silicone. Liquid silicone is strictly regulated by the FDA, and may be legally injected directly into the human body only as a treatment for certain eye conditions.In April 2004, Roberts began ordering liquid silicone from a business in Arizona. In order to purchase liquid silicone from the business, Roberts submitted an affidavit to the company in which she falsely swore that she did not intend to inject the silicone into humans. Rather she claimed that she intended to supply the silicone to a customer for use in lubricating medical equipment.On multiple occasions, Roberts transported liquid silicone to the Atlanta area and injected it into the hips, buttocks, and other body parts of her victims. Roberts falsely claimed to her victims that she was a licensed medical practitioner.During the evening of November 16, 2015, Roberts injected liquid silicone into the buttocks of victim L.H. The next day L.H. complained of tightness in her chest and shortness of breath, symptoms that are consistent with the presence of liquid silicone in the lungs. During the early morning hours of November 18, 2015, L.H., died.Dr. Geoffrey Smith, Associate Medical Examiner for DeKalb County, performed an autopsy on L.H. Based upon the autopsy Dr. Smith determined that L.H. died from complications due to silicone polymer embolization. Dr. Smith found that L.H.’s lungs were heavily congested with liquid silicone. In addition, Dr. Smith found liquid silicone in L.H.’s liver, kidney, heart, brain, and spleen. Dr. Smith noted that each of L.H.’s buttocks had 10 injection sites.From a microscopic examination of tissue surrounding one of the injection sites Dr. Smith determined that a blood vessel had been punctured. The evidence, therefore, established that the defendant punctured the blood vessel with one of the silicone injections and that the silicone was carried by the blood stream to L.H.’s lungs and other organs causing her death.Additionally:·On November 16, 2015, the defendant illegally injected liquid silicone into the buttocks of victim J.T.·In November of 2014, the defendant injected liquid silicone into the buttocks of victim V.M.·In October of 2014, the defendant injected liquid silicone into the face of victim S.P.However, J.T., V.M., and S.P. did not die from their injections.Sentencing for Deanna Roberts, 47, of Sanford, Florida, is scheduled for May 24, 2017, at 2:00 p.m., before U.S. District Judge Orinda D. Evans.This case is being investigated by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, the Doraville Police Department, and the Atlanta Police Department.Assistant United States Attorneys William L.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseApril 12, 2017United States Department of JusticeNorthern District of AlabamaBIRMINGHAM – Federal prosecutors on Tuesday charged a former Homewood medical product distributor for falsely stating to a U.S. postal inspector that packages of human pregnancy hormone shipped to him from China contained cosmetics he ordered as a gift for his wife. Acting U.S. Attorney Robert O. Posey, U.S. Postal Inspection Service Inspector in Charge Adrian Gonzalez, and Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigation, Miami Field Office, Special Agent in Charge Justin Green announced the charge.The U.S. Attorney’s Office filed a one-count information charging ALFRED LAMOUREUX JR., 45, of Columbiana, with making a false statement to the federal government on May 9, 2016. In conjunction with the charge, prosecutors also filed a plea agreement with Lamoureux. According to the documents, Lamoureux told a postal inspector that two packages he ordered from China contained cosmetics for his wife, when Lamoureaux knew the packages contained vials of injectable human chorionic gonadotropin and he intended to sell the HCG as a means for weight loss, a use not approved by the FDA that can have harmful consequences.HCG is a hormone produced by the human placenta and found in the urine of pregnant women. FDA has approved HCG-containing drugs, but only for treatment in select cases of female infertility and hormone treatment in men, according to the information and plea agreement. FDA-approved HCG products are available only in injection form and require a valid medical prescription.There are no FDA-approved HCG products intended for weight loss and the agency has published notices stating that current scientific evidence does not support the claim that HCG is safe and effective for weight loss or treatment of obesity, according to the court documents.FDA has received reports of serious adverse events associated with HCG injections for weight loss, including cases of pulmonary embolism, depression, cerebrovascular issues, cardiac arrest, and death, according to the documents.U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Birmingham intercepted a package on Nov. 4, 2015, that originated in China and was addressed to Lamoureux at a Hoover address. On May 4, 2016, the Postal Inspection Service detained a package originating in China and addressed to Lamoureux at a Columbiana address. Both packages were declared as cosmetics, but both contained 80 vials of HCG for injection, according to the documents. Since HCG is not FDA-approved for weight loss, the hormone would not have been allowed into the country.On May 9, 2016, Lamoureux called the Columbiana Post Office to inquire about a lost package, and in a subsequent conversation with a postal inspector made his false statements about the May and November packages being presents for his wife.Lamoureux operated Phoenix Meds Inc. in Homewood from 2012 to 2015 selling medical products, including injectable and oral products, according to his plea agreement. In January 2015, the Alabama Board of Pharmacy revoked Phoenix Meds’ manufacturer/wholesaler/distributor permit for ordering and receiving drugs from an entity that did not have permits from the pharmacy board. The board also cited claims on the business’ website that HCG was “important in weight control” when the FDA had declared it unlawful to sell the drug for that purpose, the plea agreement states.Lamoureux then formed another company, Perdido Key Health and Wellness Inc. in Perdido Key, Fla. In January 2016, the Florida licensing board issued notice of intent to deny the new business’ applications for a prescription drug wholesaler permit and product registration because Lamoureux provided false information about the Alabama pharmacy board’s disciplinary action against Phoenix Meds, according to the plea agreement.The maximum penalty for making a false statement to the government is five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.The Postal Inspection Service and FDA-OCI investigated the case, which Assistant U.S. Attorney Chinelo Dike-Minor is prosecuting.###USAO - Alabama, Northern"

Hartunian; Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey G. Hughes of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General, Northeast Field Office; and Acting Special Agent in Charge Russell J. Hermann of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, New York Field Office.Senior United States District Judge Lawrence E. Kahn also imposed a three-year term of supervised release, to begin after Baum’s release from prison, and a $2,000 fine.Baum pled guilty in February to tampering with a consumer product and obtaining controlled substances by deception and subterfuge. Baum, a licensed practical nurse who worked at the hospice ward of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, in Albany, improperly accessed syringes that contained oxycodone hydrochloride.  These syringes were stored in locked containers that Baum was able to access using his individually assigned password.  Between April 8, 2014 and May 16, 2014, Baum removed the oxycodone hydrochloride from at least 25 syringes and replaced it with haloperidol.Oxycodone hydrochloride, a Schedule II controlled substance, is a highly addictive narcotic analgesic used to treat moderate to severe pain.  Haloperidol, often marketed as Haldol, is an anti-psychotic medication used to treat certain mental/mood disorders and to treat uncontrolled movements or agitation.Family members of some of the hospice patients attended today’s sentencing, and several gave statements detailing the pain and suffering that Baum inflicted on dying hospice patients and their families.U.S. Attorney Richard S. Hartunian stated: “The victims in this case were military veterans, including veterans of World War II and the Korean War.  They fought for and served our country, and eventually became hospice patients who trusted Nathan Baum to give them the medication they needed in the final moments of their lives.  Baum violated that trust by stealing their medication and replacing it with anti-psychotic medicine that would not have eased his patients’ pain.  This was a terrible crime, and Baum has received a sentence reflecting his betrayal of the nursing profession and the Department of Veterans Affairs.”Jeffrey G. Hughes, Special Agent in Charge of the VA Office of Inspector General’s Northeast Field Office, said: “The VA OIG is committed to pursuing those who would do harm to our deserving veterans and bringing those individuals to justice. We will continue to diligently pursue fraud, waste and abuse in every form as it so negatively affects our nation’s heroes.  We would also like to commend the Stratton VA Medical Center for its prompt actions and notification to our office.”Russell J. Hermann, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ New York Field Office, said: “Our office will continue to pursue those who prey on our most vulnerable patients, those in hospice, by removing their needed medications. We will continue our efforts to protect the public health and bring to justice those would compromise patients’ health and comfort in this manner.”Baum’s tampering was discovered in late May 2014, when his supervisor noticed that he was slurring his speech and his pupils were pinpoint – signs of controlled substance abuse. When federal agents inspected the locked container Baum was allowed to access, they found that three sets of oxycodone hydrochloride syringes had been tampered with.  Baum admitted to agents that he was addicted to painkillers; that he used oxycodone hydrochloride that was intended for veterans; and that he replaced the oxycodone hydrochloride in some syringes with Haldol.This case was investigated by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General and the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, and wasprosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth R.

Fitzpatrick announced.Robert Claude McGrath D.O., 65, and his son Robert Christopher McGrath, 47, both of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, each pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Robert B. Kugler in Camden federal court to separate informations charging them each with conspiracy to commit health care fraud.The McGraths, together with their practice, the Atlantic Spine & Joint Institute, have also agreed to pay $1.78 million as part of a civil settlement to resolve allegations that they illegally billed Medicare for those treatments.“Elderly patients who need physical therapy deserve properly licensed and supervised caregivers,” Acting U.S. Attorney Fitzpatrick said. “Instead, the McGraths for years used unqualified and unsupervised employees to treat their patients, all while fraudulently billing Medicare for the phony services.”“Patients undergoing physical therapy at the McGraths’ practice sought simply to feel and move better,” said Michael Harpster, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Philadelphia Division. “It seems all the defendants sought was to enrich themselves at those patients’ – and U.S. taxpayers’ – expense. Medicare fraud deals a big blow to a critical piece of our health care system. Every dollar lost to bogus billing is a dollar less to use for legitimate treatments and services.”According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:The McGraths owned and operated Atlantic Spine & Joint Institute, a medical practice with offices in Westmont, New Jersey, and Wayne, Pennsylvania. Under Medicare rules, physical therapy had to be provided by Robert Claude McGrath or by a trained physical therapist under his supervision. However, from January 2011 through April 2016, the McGraths sought to defraud Medicare by employing unlicensed, untrained persons to give physical therapy to Medicare patients, at times when Robert Claude McGrath was not even in the office to supervise. They then submitted bills to Medicare fraudulently identifying Robert Claude McGrath as the provider of physical therapy.The defendants each face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense. Sentencing for both defendants is scheduled for Sept. 19, 2017.“These criminals face serving time in prison as well as paying out a $1.78 million settlement,” said Scott J. Lampert, Special Agent in Charge for the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “Additionally, my agency reserves the right to exclude both father and son from Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health programs.”“People trust medical professionals to treat them and not cheat them,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Field Office. “Our office will continue to work with our federal law enforcement partners to pursue and bring to justice those who would exploit this vulnerable population.”In the related civil settlement, also announced today, the McGraths and Atlantic Spine agreed to pay $1.78 million plus interest to the federal government to resolve allegations that the fraudulent bills submitted under the McGraths’ scheme caused false claims to be submitted to Medicare in violation of the False Claims Act.The civil settlement resolves certain claims filed by Linda Stevens, a former billing manager at Atlantic Spine, in the District of New Jersey, under the federal False Claims Act. The federal False Claims Act contains a qui tam, or whistleblower, provision that permits whistleblowers to file suit on behalf of the United States for false claims against the government, and to share in any recovery. Ms. Stevens will receive approximately $338,200 from the settlement proceeds, along with her attorney’s fees.Acting U.S. Attorney Fitzpatrick credited agents of the FBI’s South Jersey Resident Agency, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Harpster in Philadelphia, special agents from the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Lampert, and special agents from the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge McCormack, with the investigation.Assistant U.S. Attorneys R.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseDecember 19, 2016United States Department of JusticeNorthern District of GeorgiaATLANTA - Chenhsin Chan, a/k/a Paul Chan, 44, of Elmhurst, N.Y., was sentenced to a prison term of 11 years, 3 months late Friday in connection with his online marketing and sale of dietary supplements containing ephedrine notwithstanding a federal ban. Chan was found guilty of 30 felony counts following a three-day jury trial in May 2016.\"Today’s sentence reflects the serious implications of distributing substances like ephedrine on the Internet.  Not only was he selling unsafe products, but he was marketing them online with false and misleading statements about their legality and efficacy,” said United States Attorney John Horn.  “We urge members of the public to do their homework before purchasing dietary supplements from any source, especially online.\"\"Distributing unlawful, adulterated dietary supplements fraudulently marketed and sold as ‘legal’ products place the U.S. public health at risk,\" said Justin Green, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Miami Field Office.  \"We will remain vigilant in our efforts to protect American consumers from these fraudulent and potentially dangerous products.\"According to United States Attorney Horn, the charges, and other information presented in court:  Paul Chan owned and operated The Wholesale Source, LLC, a company that marketed and sold dietary supplements, primarily through affiliated websites including www.thatswholesale.com and www.ephedrawholesale.com.  From at least July 2005 through August 2012, Chan marketed and sold dietary supplements that contained ephedrine alkaloids on his websites.  In April 2004, the FDA published a final rule declaring dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids to be adulterated because they present an unreasonable risk of illness or injury.  Chan was warned by FDA investigators and others that it was illegal to sell dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids, but he continued to do so.Chan’s websites made materially false and misleading claims concerning the use of ephedrine, such as that ephedrine has been approved by the FDA for treatment of any disease, and that ephedrine has “never been illegal.”  The jury found that these false and misleading claims were designed to lure customers into believing that it was legal to purchase adulterated dietary supplements containing ephedrine, when it was not.  Chan sold over $4.5 million in dietary supplements with ephedrine alkaloids, including to customers in the Northern District of Georgia.Chan was charged by a federal grand jury on May 29, 2014, with ten counts of mail fraud, ten counts of introducing adulterated food (namely, dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids) into interstate commerce, five counts of knowingly distributing a listed chemical (namely, ephedrine) without obtaining the required registration, and five counts of money laundering. The jury rendered a guilty verdict on all thirty counts of the indictment.United States District Judge Orinda D. Evans sentenced Chan late Friday to serve 11 years, 3 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release.  Judge Evans also entered a final order forfeiting Chan’s assets, which the jury found Chan had purchased with proceeds from his crimes, including real property in New York that had been purchased for $950,000, a Mercedes Benz purchased for over $50,000, and a Lamborghini Gallardo purchased for approximately $117,000. The Court also forfeited over $666,000 in cash.This case was investigated by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations.  The Drug Enforcement Agency provided valuable assistance.Assistant United States Attorneys Steven D. Grimberg and Kelly K. Connors prosecuted the case.For further information please contact the U.S. Attorney’s Public Affairs Office at USAGAN.PressEmails@usdoj.gov or (404) 581-6016.  The Internet address for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia is http://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga.USAO - Georgia, Northern"

Readler of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.  “These fraud schemes increase the risk that patients will receive ineffective or unsafe drugs, and can expose hospitals to exorbitant prices for drugs that are in short supply.”“We rely on pharmacies to safeguard the integrity of our prescription drug system and to protect public safety.  Turner’s financially motivated scheme is particularly troubling because it removed prescription drugs from lawful distribution channels, potentially putting consumers’ health at risk,” said U.S. Attorney Jill Westmoreland Rosefor the Western District of North Carolina.As part of her guilty plea, Turner admitted that she operated two pharmacies to fraudulently obtain prescription drugs at low prices that were only available to pharmacies that agreed to use the drugs to fill patient prescriptions.  Instead of using the drugs to fill prescriptions as she said she would, Turner sold the drugs to drug wholesalers for more than she paid, taking the drugs out of their controlled distribution system.“When prescription drugs are diverted from the legal supply chain, there is no longer any assurance that the products are safe and effective for their intended uses,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin D. Green of the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations’ Miami Field Office.  “Today’s announcement should serve as a reminder of the FDA’s continued focus on criminals that put profits ahead of the U.S. public health by distributing prescriptiondrugs outside the legitimate supply chain.”This case is being prosecuted through the coordinated efforts of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of North Carolina and the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch, with assistance from FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel.  The criminal investigation was conducted by FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations.For more information about the Consumer Protection Branch, visit its website athttp://www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch.  For more information about the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of North Carolina, visit its website athttps://www.justice.gov/usao-wdnc.Attachment(s):Download InformationDownload Turner Plea AgreementTopic(s):Consumer ProtectionComponent(s):Civil DivisionUSAO - North Carolina, WesternPress Release Number:17-1050"

Fitzpatrick announced.Merwin Marc Snyder, 64, formerly of Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey, is charged by indictment with one count of conspiracy, three counts of smuggling of misbranded drugs, one count of receipt and delivery of misbranded drugs, four counts of misbranding by dispensing prescription drugs without a valid prescription, four counts of introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce. He is scheduled to make his initial appearance this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge Joel Schneider in Camden federal court. He will then be arraigned before U.S. District Judge Noel L. Hillman.Snyder was located in China’s Jiangsu Sheng Province earlier in the month and deported back to the United States to face the pending charges. He was indicted by a federal grand jury in Camden on Dec. 9, 2015.According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for protecting the health and safety of the American public by enforcing the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), a law intended to assure that drugs are safe, effective, and bear accurate labeling containing all required information. The FDA regulates the manufacture, labeling, and distribution of all drugs shipped or received in interstate commerce.Between May 7, 2010, through July 25, 2013, Snyder allegedly received by mail from India various parcels that were accompanied by incomplete or misleading U.S. Customs declarations. The parcels contained prescription drugs, including unapproved generics that contained the active ingredients in the popular brand-name drugs Viagra, Cialis, and Levitra, as well as unapproved Mifepristone and Misoprostol. Snyder then repackaged these wholesale quantities of drugs into smaller amounts and dispensed them to consumers. Snyder did not seek FDA approval to market these drugs nor was he licensed as a pharmacist in the State of New Jersey or otherwise authorized to prescribe or dispense prescription drugs. The parcels Snyder shipped through the U.S. Postal Service contained misbranded drugs that did not bear the FDA-approved labeling.Snyder allegedly caused to be shipped 27 parcels addressed to him in Egg Harbor that contained more than 25,000 tablets of unapproved generic drugs containing Tadalifil (active ingredient in Cialis) and 28,000 tablets of Sildenafil Citrate (active ingredient in Viagra).The conspiracy count carries a maximum potential penalty of up to five years in prison.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseSeptember 12, 2017United States Department of JusticeWestern District of MissouriKANSAS CITY, Mo. – Tom Larson, Acting United States Attorney for the Western District of Missouri, announced that a former paramedic with two northwest Missouri ambulance districts pleaded guilty in federal court today to stealing pain-killing drugs and replacing the vials with water.Joseph L. Comstock, 31, of Bethany, Mo., waived his right to a grand jury and pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Beth Phillips to a federal information that charges him with three counts of tampering with a consumer product (fentanyl and morphine) with reckless disregard for the risk that another person would be placed in danger of death or bodily injury, and under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to such risk.By pleading guilty today, Comstock admitted that he emptied vials of morphine and fentanyl, taking it for his own personal use, and replaced the pain-killing drugs with sterilized water. Comstock tampered with the drug vials while working at both the NTA Ambulance District in Bethany and the Community Ambulance District of Daviess County in Gallatin, Mo., in 2014 and 2015.Comstock started tampering with drugs in March 2014, following a medical procedure to remove his tonsils. He accessed drugs on ambulances and was able to bend up the lid of the plastic boxes and dump out the drugs he wished to tamper with. He obtained both fentanyl and morphine from ambulances and replaced the drugs with sterile water.Comstock admitted there were at least two occasions where he personally treated patients with drugs he knew he had tampered with. These patients were both hip fracture patients that were supposed to receive fentanyl but instead received sterile water that Comstock had replaced in the vial.Federal officials were notified on March 4, 2015, of possible drug tampering at the NTA Ambulance District in Bethany. The chief of EMS reported that an employee had noticed two morphine syringes had broken tamper-evident seals. On Jan. 30, 2015, an employee noticed that two morphine syringes had broken tamper-evident seals. On Feb. 27, 2015, ambulance employees looked through narcotic boxes kept on the three NTA ambulances. They found a number of drugs that were missing tamper-evidence caps and had broken tamper-evident seals, including midazolam, lorazepam, morphine and fentanyl.Federal agents installed surveillance equipment at the Bethany NTA building on March 18, 2015. A camera was also placed on an ambulance, which was taken out of service. Comstock was recorded on the surveillance video as he stole morphine from the ambulance on two separate occasions on March 19 and March 23, 2015. Comstock later admitted that he had tampered with drugs on all the ambulances prior to that as well.Comstock also admitted that he tampered with drugs when he visited the Gallatin ambulance building on Feb. 24, 2015. An employee found Comstock (who had stopped working at the Gallatin ambulance company in June 2014) inside the Gallatin ambulance building. Comstock explained he had come by the Gallatin facility to use the treadmill. Later that same day, the employee went on a service call and treated a man suffering from leg pain with 100 mcg of fentanyl; however, the man did not receive any pain relief. When the employee returned, he examined the narcotics cabinet and found several fentanyl vials with loose caps, as well as morphine that appeared to have been tampered with.The Gallatin ambulance director told federal agents about another suspicious situation at his ambulance building involving Comstock that occurred a week earlier. On Feb. 17, 2015, Comstock stopped by the ambulance building to visit with another paramedic. The next day, another employee checked the narcotics cabinet and noticed two fentanyl vials without their tamper-resistant caps. Subsequently several other fentanyl vials were discovered to have been tampered with.Under federal statutes, Comstock is subject to a sentence of up to 10 years in federal prison without parole on each of the three counts. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes, as the sentencing of the defendants will be determined by the court based on the advisory sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors. Sentencing hearings will be scheduled after the completion of presentence investigations by the United States Probation Office.This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Justin G. Davids. It was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration – Office of Criminal Investigation and the Bethany, Mo., Police Department.Component(s):USAO - Missouri, Western"

U.S. District Court Judge Richard G. Stearns scheduled sentencing for Nov. 1, 2016.In September 2012, a nationwide outbreak of fungal meningitis was traced back to contaminated vials of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) manufactured by NECC, a compounding pharmacy located in Framingham, Mass.  Beginning on Oct. 31, 2012, the day a search warrant was executed at NECC, Carla and Douglas Conigliaro began withdrawing unusual sums of cash from their personal bank accounts.  The cash transactions were structured by the Conigliaros in a manner so as to evade the $10,000 reporting requirement for the filing of a currency transaction report.  The Conigliaros admitted to withdrawing $124,000 in cash in this manner.In December 2014, following a two-year investigation, the Conigliaros and 12 other employees and associates of NECC were charged in a federal indictment.  The indictment did not charge the Conigliaros with having an active role in the operations or management of NECC, but did charge them with transferring assets following the fungal meningitis outbreak.NECC’s owner and head pharmacist Barry J.

(Med Prep), and Stephen Kalinoski, its director of pharmacy and registered pharmacist-in-charge, pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy in connection with their operation of the now-defunct Tinton Falls, New Jersey-based medical drug re-packager and compounding pharmacy. The pleas were entered before United States District Judge I. Leo Glasser.The guilty pleas were announced by Bridget M. Rohde, Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and Mark McCormack, Special Agent-in-Charge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, Metropolitan Washington Field Office (FDA/OCI).According to court filings and facts presented during the plea proceeding, Med Prep processed numerous drugs, including oncology and dialysis drugs, pain medications, anesthesia drugs, and operating room drugs, in purportedly aseptic conditions. In an effort to gain market share, Med Prep repeatedly misrepresented to its customers, who consisted ofhospitals and other healthcare providers,that it adhered to, and in some areas exceeded, industry standards and laws applicable to sterile drug preparation.

Stretch; Principal Deputy Assistant U.S. Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer; Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General Steven Ryan; and Howard R. Sklamberg, the Federal Food and Drug Administration’s Deputy Commissioner for Global Regulatory Operations and Policy.Genentech, located in South San Francisco, California, and OSI Pharmaceuticals, located in Farmingdale, New York, co-promote Tarceva, which is approved to treat certain patients with non-small cell lung cancer or pancreatic cancer.  OSI Pharmaceuticals LLC is the successor to OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc., which was acquired by Astellas Holding US Inc. in 2010 and converted to a limited liability company in 2011.  The settlement resolves allegations that, between January 2006 and December 2011, Genentech and OSI Pharmaceuticals made misleading representations to physicians and other health care providers about the effectiveness of Tarceva to treat certain patients with non-small cell lung cancer, when there was little evidence to show that Tarceva was effective to treat those patients unless they had never smoked or had a mutation in their epidermal growth factor receptor, which is a protein involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells.As a result of today’s $67 million settlement, the federal government will receive $62.6 million and state Medicaid programs will receive $4.4 million.  The Medicaid program is funded jointly by the state and federal governments.“This settlement demonstrates the government’s unwavering commitment to pursue violations of the False Claims Act and recover taxpayer dollars spent as a result of misleading marketing campaigns,” said U.S. Attorney Brian Stretch for the Northern District of California.“Pharmaceutical companies have a responsibility to provide accurate information to patients and health care providers about their prescription drugs,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.  “The Department of Justice will hold those companies accountable that mislead the public about the efficacy of their products.”“Pharmaceutical companies that make misleading or unsubstantiated statements about their products can put patients at risk,” said Deputy Commissioner Howard R. Sklamberg for FDA’s global regulatory operations and policy. “The FDA will continue to work to protect the public's health by ensuring that companies do not mislead healthcare providers about their products.”“Drug manufacturers that make misleading claims about their product’s effectiveness can jeopardize the health of patients -- in this case, cancer patients,” said Special Agent in Charge Steven J. Ryan for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG).  “Our agency will continue to protect both patients and taxpayers by holding those who engage in such practices accountable for their actions.”The settlement resolves allegations filed in a lawsuit by former Genentech employee Brian Shields, in federal court in San Francisco.  The lawsuit was filed under the qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions of the False Claims Act, which permit private individuals to sue on behalf of the government for false claims and to share in any recovery.  Shields will receive approximately $10 million.  The claims resolved by the settlement are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability.This settlement illustrates the government’s emphasis on combating health care fraud and marks another achievement for the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT) initiative, which was announced in May 2009 by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  The partnership between the two departments has focused efforts to reduce and prevent Medicare and Medicaid financial fraud through enhanced cooperation.  One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act.  Since January 2009, the Justice Department has recovered a total of more than $29.8 billion through False Claims Act cases, with more than $18.2 billion of that amount recovered in cases involving fraud against federal health care programs.Assistant U.S. Attorney Ila C. Deiss and U.S. Department of Justice Civil Division Trial Attorney Jennifer Cihon handled the case with the assistance of Paralegal Jonathan Birch. The settlement is the result of a coordinated effort by the Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California, with assistance from the HHS-OIG, the HHS Office of Counsel to the Inspector General, the HHS Office of the General Counsel-CMS Division, the FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel, the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, the Office of the Inspector General for the Office of Personnel Management, the FBI, the Department of Defense Office of the Inspector General, the Office of the General Counsel for the Defense Health Agency and the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units.USAO - California, NorthernDownload GNE Signed OrderDownload GNE Settlement Agreement"

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseFebruary 16, 2017United States Department of JusticeNorthern District of GeorgiaATLANTA - Ismail Ali Khan has been convicted following a six-day jury trial of conspiracy, illegal importation of misbranded drug products from China, receiving misbranded drugs that had moved in interstate commerce, and making false statements in order to become a naturalized U.S. citizen.“Khan led a conspiracy that caused misbranded drugs to be illegally imported and distributed in the Atlanta area and throughout the southeastern United States,” said U. S. Attorney John Horn. “Because the labeling on the products failed to warn consumers of the dangers in taking the products, consumers’ health and safety were placed in jeopardy by Khan’s conduct.”“Distributing unapproved and misbranded drugs disguised as all-natural supplements places the U.S. public health at risk,” said Justin Green, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Miami Field Office. “We will remain vigilant in our efforts to protect American consumers from these fraudulent and potentially dangerous products.”According to U.S. Attorney Horn, the charges and other information presented in court: In early 2011, Khan and his brother, Ahmed Ali Khan, began ordering male enhancement products from China marketed under names such as “Maxman,” “Herb Viagra,” “Rock Hard Weekend,” “Stiff Nights,” “Happy Passengers,” “Hard Ten Days,” “Zhen Gongfu,” and “African Black Ant.” These products contained sildenafil, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viagra, and/or tadalafil, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Cialis. Both Viagra and Cialis can be obtained in the U.S. only with a prescription from a doctor.However, the labeling for the products that Khan and his brother imported and distributed did not state that they contained sildenafil or tadalafil. Instead, the products were misleadingly labeled as “all-natural” and “herbal.” The labeling for the products also failed to warn consumers about the medical risks associated with taking sildenafil and tadalafil.Khan and his brother illegally imported these drugs from China by having shippers in China falsely declare on the Customs declaration attached to the shipping boxes containing the products that the boxes contained “tea,” “coffee,” “beauty products,” and other false entries.In order to evade detection by authorities, Khan, his brother, and their co-conspirators used multiple mailing addresses rented in multiple business names at locations in the Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area to receive the shipments from China. Khan and his co-conspirators would then move the products to storage units where they would prepare orders for wholesale distributors of the products. Khan and his co-conspirators used aliases, false addresses, and fake business names to misrepresent the nature of their business when renting the storage units and mail boxes.In August 2013, during the course of the conspiracy, Khan applied to become a naturalized U.S. citizen. On the application form, Khan falsely stated that he had never committed a criminal offense for which he had not been arrested. Then on January 6, 2014, in an interview with Citizenship and Naturalization Services, and again on March 14, 2014, just before he took the oath to become a naturalized citizen, Khan falsely stated that he had never committed a crime for which he had not been arrested. Based upon Khan’s false statements, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen on March 14, 2014.Ismail Ali Khan, 29, of Decatur, Georgia, was convicted on Monday, February 13, 2017. Sentencing for Khan is scheduled for April 27, 2017, at 10:00 a.m., before U.S. District Judge Steve C. Jones. Khan was arrested on May 29, 2014, and he has remained in custody since his arrest. At his sentencing hearing, Judge Jones will sign an order that revokes Khan’s U.S. citizenship.This case was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and Homeland Security Investigations.Assistant United States Attorneys William L. McKinnon, Jr. and Trevor C. Wilmot prosecuted the case.For further information please contact the U.S. Attorney’s Public Affairs Office atUSAGAN.PressEmails@usdoj.govor (404) 581-6016.The Internet address for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia ishttp://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga.USAO - Georgia, NorthernTopic:Consumer Protection"

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseJanuary 11, 2019United States Department of JusticeDistrict of New HampshireCONCORD, N.H.-- Thomas Kellermann, 65, of Bedford, pleaded guilty in federal court on Wednesday to tampering with a consumer product and obtaining and controlled substance by fraud, announced Acting United States Attorney John J. Farley.According to court documents and statements in court, Kellerman was employed as a pharmacist at a pharmacy in Bedford that dispensed prescription drugs to patients, including patients at hospice facilities.  In 2011, Kellermann began abusing narcotic pain relievers.  In March of 2012, Kellermann took medical leave from his position.  While on medical leave in March and April 2012, Kellerman repeatedly returned to the pharmacy after business hours and on weekends and stole narcotic pain medication for his personal use.  Kellermann removed the plastic top of vials containing hydromorphone and morphine, inserted syringes into the vials, and withdrew drugs from the vials.  He then injected saline into the vials, placed a small amount of glue on top of the vials to reattach the plastic caps, and placed the vials back into pharmacy stock.  This made it appear that the vials were unused.  Kellermann also accessed hydromorphone that had been prepared for delivery to a patient, but which had been returned to the pharmacy and wasted.The tampering was discovered when an employee of the pharmacy detected irregularities in certain vials of drugs.  After the tampering was discovered, some of the vials were analyzed by an independent laboratory and found to be substantially below their labeled strength.Kellermann pleaded guilty to a two-count Information charging him with one count of tampering with a consumer product and one count of obtaining a controlled substance by misrepresentation, fraud, deception, or subterfuge. He is scheduled to be sentenced on May 9, 2018.“Tampering with controlled substances by health care workers is a very serious crime,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Farley.  “This type of activity is a betrayal of the trust that patients place in the health care system.  Tampering and diversion not only can deprive patients of needed medicine but also can expose patients to other substantial health risks. We will continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners to identify and prosecute health care workers who engage in this very dangerous conduct.”“Patients deserve to have confidence that they are receiving the proper treatment from those entrusted with providing their medical care,” said Jeffrey J. Ebersole, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ New York Field Office. “We must hold medical personnel accountable when they take advantage of their unique position and tamper with drugs needed by their patients. Tampering can not only endanger the health of patients by exposing them to contaminated products but also may deny them access to the treatments they need.”“The reckless action by this health care worker is not only a violation of the Controlled Substance Act but a betrayal of the public trust,” said DEA Special Agent in Charge Michael J. Ferguson.  “In response to the ongoing opioid epidemic DEA’s obligation is to improve public safety and public health, and we are committed to working with our law enforcement and regulatory partners to ensure that these rules and regulations are followed.”The investigation was conducted by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations and the Drug Enforcement Administration. The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Arnold H. Huftalen and Special Assistant United States Attorney Sarah Hawkins of the FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel.###Topic(s):Prescription DrugsComponent(s):USAO - New HampshirePress Release Number:18-007"

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseJuly 22, 2016United States Department of JusticeDistrict of MassachusettsBOSTON – The U.S. Attorney’s Office announced today that California-based medical device manufacturer Acclarent Inc., a subsidiary of Ethicon, a Johnson & Johnson company, has agreed to pay $18 million to resolve allegations that it caused health care providers to submit false claims to Medicare and other federal health care programs by marketing and distributing one of its products, the Relieva Stratus, for use as a drug delivery device without U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of that use.“The FDA plays a fundamental role in ensuring the safety and efficacy of medical devices and drugs in this country,” said United States Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz.  “Every time that patients receive a medical device or fill a prescription they should be able to take for granted that the FDA’s requirements have been met.  We will vigorously pursue those who ignore or seek to circumvent these important patient protections.”“The FDA approval process serves an important role in ensuring that federal health care participants receive devices that are safe, effective and medically appropriate,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.  “We will not permit companies to circumvent that process and put profits over patient safety.”“The FDA's requirement for premarket approval of medical devices is designed to ensure the health and safety of patients,” said George M. Karavetsos, Director of the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations. “The FDA will continue to aggressively pursue those who place the public health at risk and compromise the integrity of the regulatory system.”“Companies cannot ignore the regulatory process to boost their bottom line,” said Harold H. Shaw, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Boston Division.  “The FBI hopes this sends a clear message to those who disregard the laws and protections the public relies on for their safety.”“Marketing medical devices for other than FDA approved uses can expose patients to questionable medical treatments while asking taxpayers to pick up the Medicare cost,\" said Special Agent in Charge Phillip M. Coyne of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General.  \"Our investigators, working closely with our law enforcement partners, will continue to pursue allegations of such misconduct and deter those tempted to launch such illegal scams.”“We are pleased to have contributed to this outstanding multi-agency investigation,” said Jeffrey G. Hughes, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Inspector General, Northeast Field Office.  “The VA makes every attempt to ensure pharmaceutical and medical devices have gone through the necessary FDA approval processes and have been determined to be safe and effective.  When individuals and companies circumvent that process, patients and our veterans suffer.”Acclarent sold a variety of medical devices used in sinus surgeries, including a device known as the Relieva Stratus MicroFlow Spacer (Stratus).  In 2006, Acclarent received FDA clearance to market the Stratus as a spacer to be used only with saline to maintain sinus openings following surgery.  The government alleged that Acclarent intended for the Stratus to be used instead as a drug-delivery device for prescription corticosteroids, including Kenalog-40, and that the device was specifically designed and engineered for this use.The government further alleged that Acclarent marketed the Stratus as a drug delivery device even after the FDA rejected the company’s 2007 request to expand the approved uses for the Stratus.  For example, Acclarent employees trained physicians using a video that demonstrated the Stratus being used with prescription corticosteroid Kenalog-40 and also used a white, milky substance resembling Kenalog-40 when demonstrating the Stratus.In 2010, after the acquisition by Ethicon, Acclarent added a warning to its label regarding use of active drug substances in the Stratus.  By May 2013, Acclarent discontinued all sales of the Stratus and the company agreed to withdraw all FDA marketing clearances for the device, which is no longer commercially available in the United States.  Ethicon also cooperated with the government’s investigation.On Wednesday, July 20th, Acclarent’s former Chief Executive Officer, William Facteau, 47, of Atherton, California and former Vice President of Sales, Patrick Fabian, 49, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota wereconvictedfollowing a six-week jury trial of 10 misdemeanor counts of introducing adulterated and misbranded medical devices into interstate commerce.This settlement illustrates the government’s emphasis on combating health care fraud and marks another achievement for the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT) initiative, which was announced in May 2009 by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  The partnership between the two departments has focused efforts to reduce and prevent Medicare and Medicaid financial fraud through enhanced cooperation.  One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act.  Since January 2009, the Justice Department has recovered a total of more than $30 billion through False Claims Act cases, with more than $18.3 billion of that amount recovered in cases involving fraud against federal health care programs.This matter was investigated by the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Justice Department’s Civil Division; the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Chief Counsel; the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Field Division; the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General; the Defense Health Agency; the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations; Department of Defense, Office of Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service; the Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Inspector General.  The matter was handled by District of Massachusetts Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sara Miron Bloom, Patrick Callahan and Department of Justice Trial Attorneys Colin Huntley and Ross Goldstein.The claims resolved by this settlement are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability.USAO - MassachusettsTopic:Healthcare Fraud"

Scola, Jr., for distributing contaminated cheese.Wifredo A. Ferrer, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and Justin Green, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI), Miami Field Office, made the announcement.Christian Rivas, the owner of Oasis Brands, Inc. (“Oasis”), located in Miami, Florida, previously pled guilty to a two-count criminal Information.  Pursuant to Count 1, a felony, Rivas, with the intent to defraud and mislead, delivered cheese processed and packed at the Oasis facility into interstate commerce that was “adulterated . . . in that it containedlysteria monocytogenes(“listeria”) a deleterious substance, which may render the food injurious to health,” in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Section 331(a) and 333(a)(2).  Pursuant to Count 2, a misdemeanor, Rivas, as the responsible corporate official of Oasis, delivered cheese into interstate commerce, “which was prepared, packed and held [at the Oasis facility] under insanitary conditions whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health,” in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Section 331(a) and 333(a)(1).“Consumer protection is a top priority for the U.S. Attorney’s Office,” stated U.S. Attorney Wifredo Ferrer. “The Southern District of Florida will continue to work with the FDA to identify for prosecution cases where consumers are exposed to the risk of serious harm from contaminated food purchased in the marketplace, while being fraudulently led to believe that it is safe.”“U.S. consumers rely on the FDA to ensure that the food they eat is safe and wholesome,” said Justin D. Green, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Miami Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who put the public’s health at risk by allowing contaminated foods to enter the U.S. marketplace.”According to the court record, including the sentencing hearing and stipulated statement of facts in support of Rivas’ guilty plea, the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services had alerted the FDA to the fact that cheese supplied by Oasis and located at a Virginia grocery store had been randomly sampled on July 26, 2014 and had tested positive for the presence of listeria.  A resulting FDA inspection of the Oasis processing facility revealed “numerous failures to comply with current Good Manufacturing Practice federal regulatory standards,” as well as several environmental swab samples taken from within the facility which tested positive for the presence of listeria.At the close of the first inspection on August 22, 2014, Rivas agreed to do the following: (1) suspend manufacturing of new cheese products; (2) hire a consultant to inform the firm how to clean its facility; (3) stop distribution of finished food products in its inventory until a laboratory (retained by Oasis at its cost) could confirm that Oasis’ cheese products and its facility were negative for listeria; and (4) place all in-process product which was in the process of being manufactured or packaged and on the verge of distribution on hold until further discussions with FDA officials.From October 7 through December 16, 2014, the FDA conducted a follow-up inspection at the Oasis facility and collected product samples of “Lacteos Santa Martha Cuajada en Hoja Fresh Curd,” then in storage at the facility, one of which later tested positive for listeria.The court record indicates that subsequent to the first inspection and during the period September 24, 2014 through October 1, 2014, Rivas had, in violation of his agreement with the FDA, finished packaging multiple trays of cheese then held in-processing and had gone on to ship and distribute these items.  The cheese in question also consisted of numerous cases of individually packaged “Lacteos Santa Martha Cuajada en Hoja Fresh Curd.”  Rivas had initiated these shipments after he had learned from his testing laboratory, on September 24, 2014, that a sample of this same product had tested positive for the presence of listeria.During the course of the sentencing hearing, the Court was informed that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) had determined through DNA testing that an identified number of individuals were physically harmed as a consequence of having consumed contaminated cheese from Oasis during the summer and fall of 2014.Mr. Ferrer commended the investigative efforts of the FDA-OIC.  This case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter Outerbridge.Related court documents and information may be found on the website of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida atwww.flsd.uscourts.govor onhttp://pacer.flsd.uscourts.gov.USAO - Florida, Southern"

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseSeptember 25, 2017INTERPOLLyon, FranceLYON, France – In the largest action of its kind, INTERPOL’s Operation Pangea X targeting the illicit online sale of medicines and medical devices saw some 400 arrests worldwide and the seizure of more than USD 51 million worth of potentially dangerous medicines.Involving 197 police, customs and health regulatory authorities from a record 123 countries, Operation Pangea X led to a record number of 25 million illicit and counterfeit medicines seized worldwide.The action resulted in the launch of 1,058 investigations, 3,584 websites taken offline and the suspension of more than 3,000 online adverts for illicit pharmaceuticals.Among the fake and illicit medicines seized during the international week of action (12 – 19 September) were dietary supplements, pain reduction pills, epilepsy medication, erectile dysfunction pills, anti-psychotic medication and nutritional products.In addition to medicines, Operation Pangea X also focused on the sale of illicit medical devices, such as dental devices and implants, condoms, syringes, medical testing strips and surgical equipment. Illicit devices worth an estimated USD 500,000 were recovered.Counterfeit contact lenses were discovered for sale in Jordan following complaints from customers, and authorities warned the fake lenses could cause serious eye damage.As well as raids at addresses linked to the illicit pharmaceutical websites, some 715,000 packages were inspected and 470,000 seized by customs and regulatory authorities.In the country’s first year participating in Operation Pangea, authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo confiscated nearly 650 kg of illicit anti-malaria pills.This year’s operation also saw the highest participation of African countries, many taking part for the first time, underscoring the truly global nature of the illicit online pharmaceutical trade.“The sale of fake or counterfeit pharmaceuticals is a growing concern across Africa, as it creates a dangerous situation for the health of unsuspecting consumers who trust that the products they purchase are safe to use. Global actions such as Operation Pangea X are critical to cutting off the supply of dangerous medicines and apprehending the criminals behind this deadly trade,” said Immanuel Sam, Head of the INTERPOL National Central Bureau in Namibia.This year, the operation also targeted the illicit trade in opioid painkillers, in particular the drug Fentanyl. A powerful narcotic, in the last few years the distribution of illicitly manufactured Fentanyl has been linked to thousands of overdoses and deaths worldwide.Seizures of Fentanyl purchased from illicit online pharmacies occurred in several countries. Highlighting the scope of the demand for illicit Fentanyl, numerous websites exclusively selling the drug were closed down including one called ‘Where to buy Fentanyl without a prescription’.Starting with just eight countries in 2008, Operation Pangea has grown exponentially during the past 10 years, with police, customs and drug regulatory authorities from 123 countries taking part in 2017.In addition to interventions on the ground, including the seizure of 1.2 tonnes of erectile dysfunction pills in Vietnam, the operation also targeted the main areas exploited by organized crime in the illegal online medicine trade: rogue domain name registrars, electronic payment systems and delivery services. Social media sites illegally advertising or selling illicit medicines were also shut down.The main trend identified during the decade of Pangea operations is the continuous growth of unauthorized and unregulated online pharmacies, which capitalize on increasing consumer demand worldwide to advertise and sell illicit or counterfeit medicines.“With more and more people purchasing everyday items including medicines online, criminals are exploiting this trend to make a profit, putting lives at risk in the process,” said INTERPOL’s Executive Director of Police Services, Tim Morris.“The fact that we still see such strong outcomes after 10 years of Pangea operations demonstrates how the online sale of illicit medicines is an ongoing, and ever increasing, challenge for law enforcement and regulatory authorities,” concluded Mr Morris.Investigations launched during previous Pangea actions continue to see positive results. Eleven people recently received sentences ranging from a few months to six years following a UK investigation opened in 2010 into a criminal network importing and selling counterfeit erectile dysfunction pills across Europe. Through these illicit sales, the network generated more than USD 10 million in criminal proceeds.A dedicated operations centre at INTERPOL’s General Secretariat headquarters in Lyon served as the central hub for information exchange among the participating countries and agencies. From this base, the World Customs Organization (WCO) coordinated activities between participating customs administrations and the Pangea team via its secure messaging system, and a mobile Europol office in Budapest, Hungary also conducted cross-checks.Viggo Elster, Manager for the WCO’s IPR, Health and Safety Programme, said: “The WCO thanks all the participating customs administrations around the globe for their support, efforts and contribution during the 10th Operation Pangea, leading to the seizure of 25 million potentially dangerous medicines and medical devices. The Pangea operation is of high importance to the WCO, particularly for the opportunity it gives for customs, police and other law enforcement authorities to strengthen their cooperation.”In addition to disrupting the criminal networks involved in the sale of illicit and counterfeit medicines, Operation Pangea X also aimed to raise public awareness of the potential dangers associated with buying pharmaceuticals online.PARTICIPATING COUNTRIESAlbania, Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bahrain, Belarus, Belgium, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Burundi, Cambodia, Canada, Cameroon, Chad, Chile, China, Comoros, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Curaçao, Cyprus, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, El Salvador, Egypt, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Korea (Republic Of), Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mali, Maldives, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Seychelles, Senegal, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Zambia."

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseNovember 4, 2016United States Department of JusticeTwo Pakistani nationals, who have been held in continuous custody since their October 2012 arrest in London, have been sentenced by Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell of the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia, after pleading guilty to charges related to their operation of Internet sites that illegally shipped pharmaceuticals from Pakistan and the United Kingdom to customers in the United States, the Department of Justice announced.Sheikh Waseem Ul Haq, 43, and Tahir Saeed, 54, operated Internet sites that, from late 2005 until October 2012, illegally shipped $2 million of pharmaceuticals from Pakistan and the United Kingdom to customers worldwide, including nearly $780,000 in sales to U.S. purchasers.Ul Haq was sentenced today to time served.  On Sept. 23, Saeed was sentenced to time served.  Both defendants will remain in federal custody pending their removal from the United States to Pakistan. Following both defendants October 2012 arrest at a hotel near Heathrow Airport by the London Metropolitan Police Service Fugitive Squad, they were extradited to the District of Columbia in the spring of 2013, following the return in November 2012 of a 48-count indictment.  In addition to their prison terms, each defendant agreed to forfeit $388,265.11.Ul Haq pleaded guilty to all 48 counts of the indictment, which charged him with conspiracy to import Schedule II, III and IV controlled substance pharmaceuticals into the United States; conspiracy to distribute Schedule II, III and IV controlled substance pharmaceuticals; conspiracy to introduce misbranded pharmaceuticals into interstate commerce; importation and distribution of controlled substance pharmaceuticals; introduction into interstate commerce of misbranded drugs and conspiracy to commit international money laundering.  Saeed pleaded guilty to conspiracy to import Schedule II, III and IV controlled substance pharmaceuticals into the United States; conspiracy to introduce misbranded pharmaceuticals into interstate commerce and conspiracy to commit international money laundering.As part of the guilty pleas, the defendants admitted that they owned and operated two businesses, Waseem Enterprises and Harry’s Enterprises.  Both businesses were used to conduct wholesale pharmaceutical sales, as well as to unlawfully distribute a wide variety of controlled substances and prescription drugs through Internet sites.  The defendants directed U.S. customers to submit payments via Western Union to numerous individuals in Karachi, Pakistan, in order to conceal the fact that the funds were going to Ul Haq and Saeed.  In e-mails, the defendants admitted that they paid bribes to Pakistani customs officials to facilitate shipment of the drugs out of Pakistan.  The defendants packaged the drug shipments in ways that reduced the likelihood of interdiction by customs inspectors.The drugs the defendants shipped into the United States included methylphenidate (sold as Ritalin); various anabolic steroids; alprazolam (sold as Xanax); diazepam (sold as Valium), lorazepam (sold as Ativan); clonazepam (sold as Klonapin) and other controlled and non-controlled substances.“This prosecution demonstrates how the use of the Internet to distribute drugs illegally is a major threat to consumers,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.  “These defendants operated their Internet marketing scheme from Pakistan and were able to ship drugs illegally and directly to U.S. citizens.  We will enforce the law to protect consumers from adulterated, contaminated and counterfeit drugs and assure that only medically necessary drugs are dispensed by licensed pharmacists who are filling legitimately issued prescriptions by licensed physicians.”“We will continue to work with our partners, nationally and internationally, to protect our country from those who are intent on shipping unregulated and potentially dangerous drugs into the United States,” said U.S. Attorney Channing D. Phillips for the District of Columbia.The Department of Justice’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force sponsored and supported this complex investigation, which was investigated by the FBI’s Washington Field Office, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations and the Drug Enforcement Administration. The Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs assisted with the extradition and additional assistance was received from the London Metropolitan Police Service, INTERPOL and law enforcement agents in Germany.  The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney John P. Dominguez of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia and Senior Litigation Counsel Linda I.

Stretch, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agent in Charge John F. Bennett, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations’ Los Angeles Field Office Special Agent in Charge Lisa L. Malinowski.  The guilty verdicts followed an eight-day jury trial before the Honorable Lucy H. Koh, U.S. District Court Judge, and brings to eight the number of people convicted as part of the conspiracy.The evidence at trial demonstrated that Joseph Shayota, 64, and his wife, Adriana Shayota, 45, both of El Cajon, Calif., were leaders of a conspiracy concerning the illegal relabeling, repackaging, and eventual counterfeiting of the liquid dietary supplement 5-Hour ENERGY. The supplement is owned by Living Essentials, who manufactured all 5-Hour ENERGY at factories in Wabash, Indiana. Living Essentials registered and owns all 5-Hour ENERGY trademarks and related copyrights.  Among the important aspects of the trademarks and copyrights are various graphical elements of the product’s labeling and packaging; the 5-Hour ENERGY trademarks and copyrighted material are displayed on every bottle of 5-Hour ENERGY and display boxes. Living Essentials did not grant licenses to any individual or entity to manufacture 5-Hour ENERGY.  Joseph and Adriana Shayota (“the Shayotas”), through their company Tradeway International Inc., doing business as Baja Exporting, LLC, agreed with Living Essentials to distribute 5-Hour ENERGY in Mexico. According to the evidence at trial, rather than distributing authentic 5-Hour ENERGY with Spanish-language labeling in Mexico, the Shayotas, along with the other charged defendants, attempted to increase their profits by diverting, relabeling, repackaging, and eventually counterfeiting the product.  The jury convicted both defendants of all the charges presented against them at the trial.“A jury has now determined that the defendants were involved in a conspiracy to substitute a well-known product with a dangerous counterfeit of their own,” said U.S. Attorney Stretch. “We are proud of the hard work of our law enforcement partners in the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation who have worked so hard to uncover the evidence necessary to bring these criminals to justice.”“U.S. consumers rely on the FDA to ensure that their foods – and drinks – are safe and wholesome. When criminals introduce counterfeit foods into the U.S. marketplace, they not only cheat consumers, but place consumers’ health at risk,” said Lisa L. Malinowski, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Los Angeles Field Office. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who jeopardize the public’s health.”Under its agreement with Baja Exporting, LLC, Living Essentials agreed to manufacture the liquid 5-Hour ENERGY product and provide Spanish-language labeling and display boxes to the exporter.  Under the agreement, the 5-Hour ENERGY product provided to Baja was to be distributed only in Mexico.  The agreement also specified that Living Essentials would provide to Baja a “complete product package” including Spanish-language labeling.  The evidence at trial demonstrated that the Shayotas and charged codefendants diverted the product in order to sell it in the United States at a higher price. After initial efforts to sell the product failed because of the Spanish-language labeling and display boxes, the Shayotas took additional steps to profit illegally from the 5-Hour ENERGY product.The Shayotas and other defendants next replaced the labeling and display boxes with counterfeit labels and boxes in English designed to imitate Living Essentials’ packaging in the United States. The defendants relabeled and repackaged over 350,000 bottles of 5-Hour ENERGY.  The defendants removed the legitimate lot numbers and expiration dates, replaced them with false labeling, and sold them in the United States at a price that was lower than what Living Essentials charged for authentic United States 5-Hour ENERGY. By December 2011, the Shayotas had sold off Baja’s remaining stock of the repackaged/relabeled 5-Hour ENERGY.Further, the evidence at trial demonstrated that by early 2012, the Shayotas and other defendants began to substitute the entire 5-Hour ENERGY product with a counterfeit product. They manufactured the counterfeit 5-Hour ENERGY liquid at an unsanitary facility using untrained day workers, and mixed unregulated ingredients in plastic vats while attempting to mimic the real 5-Hour ENERGY products.  From approximately December 2011 through October 2012, the defendants ordered more than seven million counterfeit label sleeves and hundreds of thousands of counterfeit display boxes, and placed false lot and expiration codes on the bottles and boxes.  They often changed the lot and expiration codes on the counterfeit bottles and boxes to parallel the valid codes being used on the authentic product.In addition, evidence at trial demonstrated that from May 2012 to October 2012, Midwest Wholesale Distributors, a company owned by defendant Walid Jamil, distributed more than four million bottles of counterfeit 5-Hour ENERGY into commercial channels throughout the United States. Midwest sold over 500,000 counterfeit 5-Hour ENERGY bottles to Baja Exporting and over 3,500,000 counterfeit 5¬ Hour ENERGY bottles to the Dan-Dee Company, which was owned by defendants Kevin Attiq and Fati Attiq.A Superseding Information was filed on June 29, 2016, charging the Shayota’s, Jamil, the Attiqs, and four others with conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit goods, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2320(a); and conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement and conspiracy to introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.Joseph Shayota and Adriana Shayota are out of custody pending sentencing. Their sentencing hearing is scheduled for April 5, 2017, before Judge Koh in San Jose.  The maximum statutory penalty for conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit goods is ten years’ imprisonment, a fine of $2,000,000 and restitution.  The maximum statutory penalty for conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement and conspiracy to introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce is five years’ imprisonment, a $250,000 fine, and restitution.  However, any sentence will be imposed by the court only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. § 3553.Six defendants, listed below, have pleaded guilty.DefendantGuilty PleaSentencing DateKevin Attiq, 58, of El CajonConspiracy to Commit Criminal Copyright Infringement, and to Introduce Misbranded Food into Interstate Commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371February 1, 2017Raid Jamil, 47, of West Bloomfield, MichiganConspiracy to Commit Criminal Copyright Infringement, and to Introduce Misbranded Food into Interstate Commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371May 17, 2017Walid Jamil, 66, of Troy, MichiganConspiracy to Traffic in Counterfeit Goods, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 23202(a), and Conspiracy to Commit Criminal Copyright Infringement, and to Introduce Misbranded Food into Interstate Commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371April 26, 2017Mario Ramirez, 57, of San Diego, CaliforniaConspiracy to Commit Criminal Copyright Infringement, and to Introduce Misbranded Food into Interstate Commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371February 8, 2017Leslie Roman, 62, of Rancho Cucamonga, CaliforniaConspiracy to Commit Criminal Copyright Infringement, and to Introduce Misbranded Food into Interstate Commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371February 8, 2017Justin Shayota, 33, of San Diego, CaliforniaConspiracy to Traffic in Counterfeit Goods, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 23202(a), and Conspiracy to  Introduce Misbranded Food into Interstate Commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371March 15, 2017Defendant Juan Romero remains a fugitive.Assistant U.S. Attorneys Matt Parrella and Susan Knight are prosecuting the case with the assistance of Lakisha Holliman, Nina Burney, and Elise Etter.  The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations.USAO - California, Northern"

Stretch, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agent in Charge John F. Bennett, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations’ Los Angeles Field Office Special Agent in Charge Lisa L. Malinowski.  The sentences were handed down yesterday by the Honorable Lucy H. Koh, U.S. District Court Judge, bringing an end to all but one of the cases brought against 11 defendants charged in a scheme involving the manufacture and sale of millions of bottles of the liquid dietary supplement 5-Hour ENERGY.On November 28, 2016, a jury in San Jose found Joseph Shayota, 64, and his wife, Adriana Shayota, 45, (the Shayotas) guilty of conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit goods, as well as conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement and to introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce.  The criminal conduct began in late 2009 and ran through October 2012.  Over 3,700,000 bottles of counterfeit 5-Hour ENERGY were placed in the stream of interstate commerce.Besides the Shayotas, other defendants charged with various roles in the scheme include: Justin Shayota, 33, of Spring Valley, Calif.; Walid Jamil, 57, of Troy, Mich.; Raid Jamil, 48, of West Bloomfield, Mich.; Kevin Attiq, 52, of El Cajon, Calif.; Fadi Attiq, 59, of El Cajon, Calif.; Leslie Roman, 63, Rancho Cucamonga, Calif.; Mario Ramirez, 56, of San Diego; Camilo Ramirez, 32, of San Diego; and Juan Romero, 70, of Mexico City, Mexico.“Acting out of pure greed, these defendants gambled with the health and safety of millions of users of this well-known consumer product,\" said U.S Attorney Brian Stretch.  \"Consumers can rightly expect that the commercial products they buy are safe to ingest.  Those individuals who manufacture and distribute unsafe counterfeit food products will be prosecuted and sent to jail.”“By trafficking in counterfeit dietary supplements, Joseph Shayota and Walid Jamil led an organized criminal conspiracy that violated intellectual property rights and endangered the health and safety of the public for their own financial gain,” said Special Agent in Charge Bennett.  “The FBI is committed to identifying, arresting, and prosecuting those who defraud US businesses and put consumers at risk in an attempt to line their own pockets.  I want to thank the FBI special agents and analysts, as well as our partners at the FDA and U.S. Attorney’s Office, for their tireless work on this investigation.”“Criminals who mislead unsuspecting U.S. consumers by selling them counterfeit and false-labeled products cheat the American consumer and endanger the public’s health,” said Special Agent in Charge Malinowski. “We will continue to protect the U.S. consumer by working to bring to justice those who place profits above public health.”At trial, the evidence demonstrated that the Shayotas, through their company Tradeway International Inc., (doing business as Baja Exporting, LLC), entered into an agreement with Living Essentials, LLC, to distribute 5-Hour ENERGY in Mexico.  Living Essentials owns 5-Hour ENERGY and registered and owns all 5-Hour ENERGY trademarks and related copyrights.  The company does not grant licenses to any individual or entity to manufacture 5-Hour ENERGY.  As part of the distribution agreement, Living Essentials manufactured and provided the Spanish-labeled 5-Hour ENERGY bottles to the Shayotas, who were unable to sell it in Mexico.  The Shayotas and their co-conspirators then removed the Spanish-language labels and replaced them with counterfeit English-language labels.  They also removed the true lot numbers and expiration dates placed on the bottles by Living Essentials and replaced them with false lot numbers and expiration dates.  The Shayotas and their co-conspirators sold this counterfeit-labelled product throughout the U.S.The evidence at trial demonstrated that by early 2012, the Shayotas and their co-conspirators began to manufacture and sell an entirely counterfeit 5-Hour ENERGY product.  They manufactured the counterfeit 5-Hour ENERGY liquid at an unsanitary facility using untrained day workers, and mixed unregulated ingredients in vats in an attempt to mimic the real 5-Hour ENERGY products.  The Shayotas and their co-conspirators engaged a plastics manufacturer in Mexico to copy the 5-Hour ENERGY bottles and caps, and recruited co-conspirators in the San Diego area to create counterfeit display boxes and plastic sleeves (bottle labels), which appeared identical to the true boxes and labels.  The Shayotas and their co-conspirators also copied true lot numbers and expiration dates from genuine 5-Hour ENERGY and placed those numbers and dates on the counterfeit bottles that they had manufactured.From approximately December 2011 through October 2012, the Shayotas and their co-conspirators ordered more than seven million counterfeit label sleeves and hundreds of thousands of counterfeit display boxes, and placed false lot and expiration codes on the bottles and boxes.  They often changed the lot and expiration codes on the counterfeit bottles and boxes to parallel the valid codes being used on the authentic product.The government filed a Superseding Information on June 29, 2016, charging each of the defendants with one count of conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit goods, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §2320(a), and one count of conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement and to introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.  Following this afternoon’s sentencing, the disposition as against eight of the defendants is as follows:DefendantCharges and DispositionSentenceJoseph

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseMay 31, 2017United States Department of JusticeDistrict of UtahSALT LAKE CITY – A federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment Wednesday morning charging six individuals in what the indictment alleges is an international drug trafficking organization involved in manufacturing fake prescription drugs made from Fentanyl. Hundreds of thousands of the fake pills were then distributed throughout Utah and the United States to customers who had ordered pills from their dark net online store.Charged in the indictment are Aaron Michael Shamo, age 27, of Cottonwood Heights, Utah; Drew Wilson Crandall, age 30, of Brisbane, Australia; Alexandrya Marie Tonge, age 25, and Katherine Lauren Ann Bustin, age 26, both of South Jordan; and Mario Anthony Noble, age 28, and Sean Michael Gygi, age 27, both of Midvale.Announcing today’s indictment are U.S. Attorney John W. Huber, DEA District Agent in Charge Brian S. Besser, Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent in Charge John Eisert, IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge Tara Sullivan, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Special Agent in Charge Spencer E. Morrison, and Jared Bingham, U.S. Postal Inspector and Team Leader for the Salt Lake City Postal Inspection Service.According to documents filed in federal court, the organization began with Aaron Michael Shamo and Drew Wilson Crandall, but grew to include other co-conspirators. Shamo and Crandall, according to court records, purchased pill presses, dies and stamps to mark pills so the markings would match those of legitimate pharmaceutical drugs, and inert pill ingredients, such as binding agents and colors. Some items were purchased legally and others, such as Fentanyl and Alprazolam, were imported into the United States illegally, including from China. To avoid detection, Shamo and Crandall had many of their supplies shipped to nominees or straw purchasers.The ingredients were then be pressed into pills that had the appearance of legitimate pharmaceuticals. The fake Oxycodone-type pills and the counterfeit Alprazolam tablets were sold on the dark net at a significant profit. Once sold, Shamo and Crandall used the co-conspirators to package the pills and ship them to customers. According to documents filed in court, the enterprise sold hundreds of thousands of pills in Utah and throughout the United States.The indictment alleges that Shamo, working in concert with at least five other people, occupied a position of principal administrator, organizer, supervisor and leader of a continuing criminal enterprise, which involved possession with intent to distribute and distribution of more than 12,000 grams of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of Fentanyl, a controlled substance. The indictment further alleges that Shamo obtained substantial income and resources through the continuing series of violations. Count 1 of the indictment charges Shamo with knowingly and intentionally engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise.Counts 2 through 9 and count 12 of the indictment charge various defendants in the case with alleged violations of federal law committed as predicate acts in support of the continuing criminal enterprise. The counts include conspiracy to distribute Fentanyl, conspiracy to distribute Alprazolam, aiding and abetting the importation of a controlled substance, possession of Fentanyl with intent to distribute, manufacture of Alprazolam, and use of the United States mail in furtherance of as drug trafficking offense.Counts 10 and 11 of the indictment charge Shamo with knowing and intentional adulteration of drugs held for sale. The counts allege Shamo manufactured round blue tablets and offered those tables for sale on the internet as “Oxycodone 30 mg.” Count 10 alleges the tablets were debossed with “A 215” on the bisected side. Count 11 alleges the tablets were manufactured with an “” on one side and a “30” above the bisect on the other side. Such markings mimick the markings of legitimate Oxycodone tablets. Despite those representations, the indictment alleges the defendants did not use Oxycodone at all in the manufacturing process, but instead, substituted Fentanyl, a much more potent synthetic opioid. The indictment alleges the adulteration had a reasonable probability of causing serious adverse health consequences or death to humans.The final three counts of the indictment allege conspiracy to commit money laundering, money laundering concealment and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activities. The indictment also includes a notice seeking criminal forfeiture of currency, automobiles, a pill press, and a variety of pill dies and punches used as a part of the alleged criminal enterprise.Indictments are not findings of guilt. Individuals charged in an indictment are presumed innocent unless or until proven guilty in court.Because of the volume of drugs involved in the case, Shamo faces mandatory life in prison if convicted of Count 1. The potential maximum penalty for Count 2 in the indictment, conspiracy to distribute Fentanyl, is life in prison with a mandatory minimum 10 years and a $10 million fine. The potential penalty for Count 3, conspiracy to distribute Alprazolam, is five years and a fine of $250,000.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseJuly 6, 2016United States Department of JusticePharmaceutical Innovations Inc., based in Newark, New Jersey, pleaded guilty today to criminal charges and resolved a civil lawsuit arising from the company’s distribution of ultrasound gel contaminated with bacteria, the Department of Justice announced.  The devices at issue are gels that doctors and hospitals use to take ultrasound scans, sonograms, EKGs and similar procedures.Pharmaceutical Innovations Inc. pleaded guilty before U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas in Newark federal court to an information charging it with two misdemeanor counts of introducing adulterated medical devices into interstate commerce. In addition to placing the company on two years of probation, Judge Salas ordered the company to pay a criminal fine of $50,000 and to forfeit an additional $50,000 – the approximate value of the adulterated gel.In a related civil settlement, which was also resolved today,  Pharmaceutical Innovations agreed to the forfeiture and destruction of particular gel products that tested exceptionally high for infectious bacteria and agreed to a permanent injunction that requires independent experts and auditors to conduct regular inspections and certifications at the company’s expense.“The sale of adulterated medical devices puts patients at great risk,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.  “Device manufacturers that fail to comply with good manufacturing practices, thereby threatening patient safety, will be held accountable.”“Pharmaceutical Innovations shipped defective products that exposed hospital patients to dangerous bacterial contamination,” said U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman for the District of New Jersey.  “Today’s plea agreement and civil settlement require Pharmaceutical Innovations to accept responsibility for the contamination and take the necessary steps to prevent it from happening again.”According to documents filed in the case and statements made in court:Doctors and hospitals use ultrasound gel to take ultrasound scans, sonograms, EKGs and similar procedures. In February 2012, a Michigan hospital reported that 16 surgical patients were infected withPseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterial pathogen.  The hospital believed the infections were associated with a particular lot of Pharmaceutical Innovations ultrasound gel.A sample of that lot then tested positive forPseudomonas aeruginosa.  A second lot was shipped in April 2012 and found to be contaminated with two types of bacteria,Pseudomonas aeruginosaandKlebsiella oxytoca, both at the Michigan hospital, and at the company’s Newark facility.The U.S. Department of Justice filed suit in October 2014 against Pharmaceutical Innovations and its founder, owner, and longtime president, Gilbert Buchalter.  (Gilbert Buchalter was later dropped from the case; his son, Charles Buchalter, became company president and was added to the case.)  The civil complaint alleged that the company was selling medical devices that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had not approved or cleared, that it was violating current good manufacturing practices and that it failed to take required actions after receiving reports in February 2012 of serious injuries associated with its products.The Consent Decree of Permanent Injunction requires Pharmaceutical Innovations to submit a detailed compliance plan to FDA within 20 days, and to have outside experts certify in writing by Oct. 31, that the company meets current good manufacturing practice requirements.  The FDA will then conduct a follow-up inspection at the company’s expense. For the next three years, Pharmaceutical Innovations must hire outside auditors to conduct and submit detailed audit reports to FDA.  In addition, the company will forfeit and pay for the destruction of contaminated “Other Sonic Gel” that the U.S. Marshals Service seized in April 2012 as part of a seizure and forfeiture case filed by the United States.The criminal investigation in this matter was handled by special agents of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations’ New York Field Office, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey Ebersole.The criminal prosecution was handled by Assistant U.S. Attorney R. David Walk Jr. of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey’s Health Care and Government Fraud Unit, with the assistance of Associate Chief Counsel Lynn M. Marshall of the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of General Food-Food and Drug Division.  The civil cases were handled by Trial Attorney Daniel K. Crane-Hirsch of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch and by Senior Counsel Michele Lee Svonkin and Associate Chief Counsel Julie A. Dohm of the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of General Counsel–Food and Drug Division.  Additional assistance in the civil cases was provided by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Lucy Muzzy, Marion Purcell, Peter Gaeta and Jacob Elberg of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey.For more information about the Consumer Protection Branch, visit its website athttp://www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch.

Stearns to 108 months in prison and three years of supervised release, and forfeiture and restitution in an amount to be determined later. In March 2017, Cadden was convicted by a federal jury of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud and mislead.“Barry Cadden put profits over patients,” said Acting United States Attorney William D. Weinreb. “He used NECC to perpetrate a massive fraud that harmed hundreds of people. Mr. Cadden knew that he was running his business dishonestly, but he kept doing it anyway to make sure the payments kept rolling in. Now he will have to pay for his crimes.”“Barry Cadden put profits ahead of patients,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Chad A. Readler of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “Under his direction, employees assured customers that they were getting safe drugs, while Cadden ignored grave environmental failures, used expired active ingredients, and took innumerable other production shortcuts that led to numerous, entirely preventable deaths. As Cadden’s sentence reflects, the Justice Department's Consumer Protection Branch is committed to prosecuting those who put the health of Americans at risk.”“Protecting Americans from unsafe and contaminated drugs is at the core of our mission. Patients should not have to worry about the safety and sterility of the drugs they are prescribed,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “Since this tragedy, Congress has given the FDA important new authorities, and the agency has implemented key policies, all to provide a greater assurance of safety over compounded medicines. As part of these efforts, we will continue to hold accountable those who violate the law and put patients at risk.”“Today, Barry Cadden was held responsible for one of the worst public health crises in this country’s history, and the lives of those impacted because of his greed, will never be the same,” said Harold H. Shaw, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Field Division. “This deadly outbreak was truly a life-changing event for hundreds of victims, and the FBI is grateful to have played a role, alongside our law enforcement partners, in bringing this man to justice.”In 2012, 753 patients in 20 states were diagnosed with a fungal infection after receiving injections of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) manufactured by NECC. Of those 753 patients, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 64 patients in nine states died. The outbreak was the largest public health crisis ever caused by a pharmaceutical product.Specifically, Cadden directed and authorized the shipping of contaminated MPA to NECC customers nationwide. In addition, he authorized the shipping of drugs before test results confirming their sterility were returned, never notified customers of nonsterile results, and compounded drugs with expired ingredients. Furthermore, certain batches of drugs were manufactured, in part, by an unlicensed pharmacy technician at NECC. Cadden also repeatedly took steps to shield NECC’s operations from regulatory oversight by the FDA by claiming to be a pharmacy dispensing drugs pursuant to valid, patient-specific prescriptions. In fact, NECC routinely dispensed drugs in bulk without valid prescriptions. NECC even used fictional and celebrity names on fake prescriptions to dispense drugs, such as “Michael Jackson,” “Freddie Mae” and “Diana Ross.”“Today’s sentencing demonstrates the ongoing commitment of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) to protect the integrity of TRICARE, the U.S. Defense Department's health care program,” stated Special Agent in Charge Leigh-Alistair Barzey of DCIS, Northeast Field Office. “DCIS will continue to work with its law enforcement partners to identify and investigate individuals who disregard pharmaceutical and drug regulations and endanger the health and safety of U.S. military members and their families.‎”“No veterans receiving VA care were harmed by the fungal meningitis outbreak,” said Special Agent in Charge Donna L. Neves for the Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Inspector General. “The VA Office of Inspector General, together with its law enforcement partners, will persist in working drug adulteration cases to ensure veterans continue to receive safe and effective medications for the purpose of healing their ailments.”“Today's sentencing is an example of the dedicated work of law enforcement, along with the U.S. Attorney’s Office Health Care Fraud Unit in their steadfast pursuit of justice in the largest public health crisis caused by a pharmaceutical product in this nation’s history,” said Shelly Binkowski, Inspector in Charge of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. “The United States Postal Inspection Service will continue to be vigilant in investigating cases where the US Mail is used to put our nation’s citizens at risk.”Acting U.S. Attorney Weinreb; Acting Assistant Attorney General Readler of the Justice Department’s Civil Division; FDA-OCI SAC Ebersole; FBI SAC Shaw; DCIS-OIG SAC Barzey; VA-OIG SAC Neves; and USPIS Inspector in Charge Binkowski, made the announcement today. Assistant U.S. Attorneys George P. Varghese and Amanda P.M. Strachan of Weinreb’s Health Care Fraud Unit and Trial Attorney John W.M.

Judge Hopkins also sentenced both defendants to one year of supervised release following their imprisonment and a $5,000 fine.“Compounding pharmacies are entrusted with protecting the public’s health from any harm their drugs may impose and must comply with the law,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.  “These cases demonstrate that the Department of Justice will continue to work aggressively with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to protect consumers from drugs compounded under insanitary conditions.”“Meds IV provided intravenous nutrition to patients, without taking legally required precautions in the preparation of its product,” said U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance for the Northern District of Alabama. “As a result, a number of patients developed serious infections.  We are committed to prosecuting this type of practice to the fullest extent of the law provides for and protecting the safety of our citizens.”“Producing unsafe and contaminated drugs poses a serious threat to the U.S. public health and cannot be tolerated,” said Director George Karavetsos of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations.  “The FDA remains fully committed to aggressively pursuing those who place unsuspecting American consumers at risk by distributing adulterated drugs.”As alleged in the information, Meds IV compounded various drugs for human use, including an intravenous drug known as Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN).  TPN is liquid nutrition administered intravenously to patients who cannot or should not receive their nutrition through eating.  The information alleged that beginning in or around February 2011, Meds IV compounded its own amino acid solution, which it then mixed with other ingredients to form TPN.As charged in the information, amino acid used in compounding the TPN was adulterated in that it was contaminated withSerratia marcescens(S. marcescens) and was prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions.S. marcescensis a bacteria that can cause bloodstream infections if introduced into the bloodstream through contaminated medications.  These infections can cause serious medical complications, including death, becauseS. marcescensis resistant to many antibiotics.According to the charging document, the amino acid was prepared by Meds IV outside a laminar airflow workbench and was kept unrefrigerated, in a room that was not sterile, in a large pot sitting on the floor, sometimes overnight, before it was sterilized and used.As alleged in the information, between March 5 and 15, 2011, nine patients at various Birmingham-area hospitals who developed bloodstream infections caused byS. marcescensdied, and several other hospital patients developedS. marcescensbloodstream infections but survived.  According to the charges, all of these patients had been given TPN that was compounded and distributed by Meds IV.  As alleged in the information, while a number of the patients who died had underlying conditions which may have contributed to their deaths, medical records of some patients suggest that theS. marcescensbloodstream infections were also a significant factor.According to the information, Meds IV was notified on March 14, 2011, by a hospital in the Birmingham area, that four patients receiving TPN had tested positive forS. marcescens.  The information alleged that the TPN was compounded and distributed by Meds IV and that this notification was the first time Meds IV was informed of a link between its TPN and patients testing positive forS. marcescens.  The information alleged that on or around March 16, 2011, Meds IV began notifying some customers that compounding of TPN was suspended until further notice.As noted in the information, during an inspection at Meds IV starting on March 22, 2011, investigators from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) foundS. marcescensthat was indistinguishable from the outbreak strain on a tap-water faucet, in an open container of amino acid powder, and on the surface of mixing equipment that had been used to make TPN.  According to the charging document, the FDA and CDC investigators linked theS. marcescensto TPN that had been compounded by Meds IV.As alleged in the information, Allen supervised all compounding at Meds IV, was specifically responsible for reviewing and approving TPN formulations and was also responsible for filling the individual prescriptions Meds IV received for patient-specific TPN products.  The information alleged that Rogers was ultimately responsible for overseeing all of the day-to-day operations of Meds IV.  Both defendants pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts, representing the two lots of amino acid which were determined to be adulterated in violation of the FDCA.The case was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Heide L. Herrmann of the Justice Department’s Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorney Henry Cornelius of the Northern District of Alabama.  They were assisted by Associate Chief Counsel Shannon M. Singleton of the Food and Drug Division, Office of General Counsel, Department of Health and Human Services.  The case was investigated by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations.Additional information about the Consumer Protection Branch and its enforcement efforts may be found athttp://www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch.

Ferrer, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, Justin Green, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI), Miami Field Office, Mark Selby, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-HSI), Miami Field Office, and Juan J. Perez, Director, Miami-Dade Police Department (MDPD), announced the arrest today of Maribel Jimenez and Magaly Del Rosario, both Miami-Dade residents, on charges contained in a twenty-count federal indictment.According to allegations contained in the indictment:Jimenez and Del Rosario are charged with conspiring, from 2008 through August 2015, to receive and deliver an adulterated and misbranded medical device in connection with their unlawful receipt and use of silicone smuggled into the U.S. from Colombia and eventually injected into hundreds of clients seeking augmentation of their buttocks, as well as their administration of injections of misbranded prescription drugs, including lidocaine and Botox, at Bella Beauty Spa (“Bella Beauty”), a business owned by Jimenez, located at 8360 West Flagler Street, Miami, Florida (Count 1). The defendants are also charged with conspiring to commit wire and mail fraud arising from their fraudulent misrepresentations to these same clients regarding the true nature of the substance which would be utilized in the clients’ buttocks injections and concealing the fact that the injected substance was, in fact, health-threatening silicone (Count 2). In addition, the defendants are charged with delivery for pay of a misbranded and adulterated medical device with intent to defraud and mislead (Counts 3-9). Jimenez is also charged with smuggling offenses (Counts 10-14) and false statement offenses (Counts 15-20).Jimenez, with assistance from Del Rosario, a manager of Bella Beauty, administered deep tissue buttock injections of substantial quantities of silicone, an adulterated medical device when used and intended to be used in this manner, to hundreds of Bella Beauty clients.The silicone which was unlawfully injected into Bella Beauty clients was clandestinely smuggled into the United States by Jimenez and co-conspirators by means of approximately 170 separate DHL air carrier shipments. To avoid the scrutiny of Customs and Border Protection, upon importation into the United States, each bottle contained false labelling stating in Spanish that the contents consisted of “Depilatory Wax” and alleged instructions on how to apply this purported rosin-based substance in a manner consistent with hair removal.After the injections, Jimenez had been informed by a number of Bella Beauty Spa clients that they were experiencing adverse health related symptoms. Jimenez and Del Rosario failed to advise the clients that silicone had been injected into their bodies. The defendants also intentionally concealed the potential health consequences arising from the injection of silicone into their clients’ bodies.Attorney Ferrer stated, “Criminal conduct that poses a significant health risk to the general public is of grave concern to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Federal prosecutors and our law enforcement allies are committed to disrupting illicit operations that hold themselves out to be legitimate medical facilities while endangering lives for profit. To best protect yourself, individuals who are considering body augmentation should do their due diligence to ensure that the procedures are performed by reputable persons and do not contain hazardous materials.”“Serious harm, including death, can occur when individuals have liquid silicone or other substances injected into their buttocks to increase their size. The FDA has not approved liquid silicone or other injectable substances to increase the size of the buttocks,” said Justin D. Green, Special Agent in Charge, FDA-OCI Miami. “Our office will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who offer this hazardous procedure to the public.”“The suspects in this investigation put their own financial enrichment well above the health and safety of the hundreds of people who trusted them,” said Mark Selby, Special Agent in Charge of HSI Miami. \"At HSI we will continue to work with our federal, international and local law enforcement partners to put an end to this dangerous practice.\"Defendants Jimenez and Del Rosario appeared in court today for their initial hearings. Jimenez is scheduled for a pre-trial detention hearing on Friday, February 17, 2017.Individual clients of Bella Beauty Spa who have undergone buttocks injection procedures, regardless of how far in the past, are urged to contact bellabeautyinjections@fda.hhs.gov in order to receive additional information, address individual concerns, and to receive information concerning their status and rights as potential victims.An indictment is a formal charging documents notifying the defendant of the charges. All persons charged by indictment are presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.Mr. Ferrer commended the investigative efforts of each of FDA, MDPD and ICE-HSI.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseJune 22, 2017United States Department of JusticeThe owner and director of compliance of an Indiana compounding pharmacy were charged criminally in connection with their distribution of over- and under-potent drugs, and defrauding the United States by interfering with and obstructing the lawful functions of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Department of Justice announced today.Paul J. Elmer, 64, of Fishers, Indiana, and Caprice R. Bearden, 62, of Carmel, Indiana, were charged in a 10-count indictment with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, three counts of distributing an adulterated drug in interstate commerce and six counts of adulterating drugs while held for sale after shipment of a drug component in interstate commerce. Elmer was arrested yesterday and had his initial court appearance in U.S. District Court in the Southern District of Indiana where he pleaded not guilty and was released under conditions imposed by the Court. Trial has been scheduled for Aug. 21 at 9 a.m.“The distribution of over- and under-potent drug products poses a serious risk of harm to patients,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Chad A. Readler of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “FDA’s efforts to ensure the safety of compounded drugs is critically important. Impeding FDA’s ability to do its job and uncover these types of safety concerns will not be tolerated. The Justice Department is committed to working with FDA to protect patients and ensure compounded drugs are safe.”“These defendants put greed and the reputation of their company ahead of the health and safety of our most innocent victims,” said U.S. Attorney Josh Minkler for the Southern District of Indiana. “Their actions put lives in danger and they will be held accountable.”Elmer owned and was the President of Pharmakon Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Pharmakon), and Bearden was the company’s Director of Compliance. Pharmakon compounded drugs at a facility in Noblesville, Indiana for customers in Indiana and many other states.The indictment alleges that from July 2013 through mid-February 2016, Bearden received approximately 70 potency test failure notices from companies used by Pharmakon to test for potency, indicating that drugs such as morphine sulfate and fentanyl were either under- or over-potent. According to the indictment, Bearden discussed the out-of-specification test results with Elmer, a licensed pharmacist, and until Pharmakon compounded over potent morphine sulfate in February 2016, Elmer determined that Pharmakon should not contact any individuals or entities – including hospitals – who received the drugs, nor conduct any product recalls before FDA intervention.On several occasions, according to the indictment, infants were injected with drugs compounded by Pharmakon - that were significantly over-potent. For example, the indictment alleges that in early February 2016, Pharmakon distributed over potent morphine sulfate, an opioid typically used for relief of moderate to severe acute and chronic pain, to a hospital in Indiana and a hospital in Illinois. As alleged in the indictment, three infants at the hospital in Indiana received the morphine sulfate which was nearly 25 times the strength indicated on its label, and one infant was taken by emergency helicopter to a nearby children’s hospital.Further, as alleged in the indictment, during FDA inspections of Pharmakon in 2014 and 2016, Bearden lied about Pharmakon’s never having received any out-of-specification drug potency test results. According to the indictment, Elmer learned of Bearden’s lies during or shortly after the FDA’s inspections and took no action to correct her and to inform the FDA of the extent of Pharmakon’s drug potency failures. The indictment alleges that Elmer and Bearden conspired to defraud the United States by interfering with and obstructing the lawful functions of the FDA, and obstructing, influencing and impeding FDA inspections. In addition, as alleged, during the 2016 inspection, Elmer directed at least one Pharmakon employee to backdate batch records of compounded drugs.“Companies that do not meet federal manufacturing standards, especially when dealing with highly potent drugs like fentanyl meant for vulnerable populations, put the health and safety of American consumers at great risk,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “The FDA and our Office of Criminal Investigations will continue to pursue and help bring to justice those companies who put the public health at risk.”According to the indictment, during two inspections of Pharmakon in 2014, FDA observed conditions that did not comply with FDA regulations. The indictment alleges that Elmer and Bearden failed to investigate the root causes of the drug potency failures and otherwise failed to make changes in Pharmakon’s compounding operations to reduce the incidence of these failures. Instead, as alleged in the indictment, under the direction and supervision of Elmer and Bearden, Pharmakon continued to distribute under- and over-potent drugs, shipping these drugs before receiving the potency test results.The conspiracy charge carries a statutory maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or gross loss from the offense. The charges of distributing an adulterated drug in interstate commerce and adulterating drugs while held for sale after shipment of a drug component in interstate commerce each carry a statutory maximum punishment of one year in prison and a fine of $100,000 or twice the gross gain or gross loss from the offense.Acting Assistant Attorney General Readler and U.S. Attorney Minkler commended the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, which conducted the investigation.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseApril 12, 2017United States Department of JusticeCentral District of CaliforniaLOS ANGELES– The owners of two local drug wholesale companies were among four defendants taken into custody this morning on federal “structuring” charges that allege they made millions of dollars in cash deposits designed to circumvent federal reporting requirements.Law enforcement authorities this morning arrested Richard Kayseryan, 41, of Burbank, the owner of Burbank-based TriMed Medical Wholesalers, Inc. Kayseryan is the lead defendant in a 20-count indictment returned on April 6 by a federal grand jury that charges four individuals and TriMed in relation to two separate schemes to structure millions of dollars in proceeds through “funnel” bank accounts set up in the names of shell companies.Two other defendants – Derou Biglari, 31, and Jivani Markarian, 33, who own the Glendale-based drug wholesale business JD Pharmaceutical Wholesaler, Inc. – and the fourth defendant – Rafik Mesropyan, 56 – surrendered this morning. These three co-conspirators, all Glendale residents, are charged with depositing millions of dollars of TriMed checks for Kayseryan, and returning the funds to him in the form of cash.The four individuals and TriMed are expected to be arraigned on the indictment this afternoon in United States District Court.As part of the scheme, TriMed collected millions of dollars from business activities and Kayseryan prepared checks that he delivered to his co-defendants. The co-conspirators deposited the checks into the funnel accounts and immediately withdrew the funds in cash in amounts at or under $10,000 per transaction, according to the indictment. These transactions were designed to prevent banks from reporting the cash withdrawals to the federal government, which is required for every cash transaction of more than $10,000.The indictment also charges Kayseryan with lying to federal agents about the funds during an interview in June 2016. Kayseryan allegedly falsely claimed that “he issued TriMed checks payable to the shell businesses,…for the purpose of making interest-bearing ‘investments’ in the shell businesses” and that he “did not receive ‘one cent’ of the funds from the TriMed checks back.” In fact, the businesses did not exist at all, and Kayseryan received millions of dollars in funds back from the checks in the form of cash.Finally, the indictment charges Kayseryan with filing false tax returns that fraudulently overstated TriMed’s business expenses.Investigators believe that Kayseryan wrote checks to the shell companies from 2010 through 2015 totaling more than $20 million and that Kayseryan claimed these checks were to pay business expenses. In fact, most of the shell companies did not actually exist other than on paper.This indictment marks the third phase of Operation “Psyched Out.” The investigation previously resulted in convictions against 17 defendants connected with the operators of a fraudulent medical clinic, Manor Medical Imaging. A medical doctor employed at the location,Kenneth Johnson, and two owners of a San Marino pharmacy, Phic Lim and Theanna Khou, were convicted in that case.

Karas.U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara stated: “Smutek, a former police officer, was peddling a date rape drug over the Internet from his suburban home.  The sentence imposed on him by the Court properly reflects the callous nature of his years-long drug dealing.”According to the allegations contained in the Indictment as well as the evidence presented during trial and at sentencing:SMUTEK sold Potion 9, which was packaged in a one-ounce plastic bottle containing a pink liquid, between 2009 and 2014, advertising it on his website as a “mood enhancer” that supposedly made the user feel euphoric.  According to the label, Potion 9 contained yohimbe, a derivation of a tree root found in South Africa, as well as other natural ingredients.  But according to the evidence at trial, Potion 9 actually contained 1,4 butanediol, an industrial solvent that converted to GHB in the body when ingested.  At sentencing, SMUTEK was held responsible for distributing 200,000 bottles of Potion 9 over five years and ordered to forfeit $1.2 million in proceeds from the scheme.In addition to his prison term SMUTEK, 53, of Sleepy Hollow, New York, was sentenced to three years of supervised release.Mr. Bharara praised the outstanding investigative work of the Rhode Island Task Force of the Office of Criminal Investigations, Food & Drug Administration.  Mr. Bharara also thanked the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation Division, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service for their assistance in the investigation.The prosecution of this case is being handled by the Office’s White Plains Division.  Assistant United States Attorneys Maurene Comey, James McMahon, and Douglas Zolkind are in charge of the case.16-321USAO - New York, Southern"

Rosenstein;Special Agent in Charge Mark McCormack of the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, Office of CriminalInvestigations’ Metro Washington Field Office; and Chief Terrence B. Sheridan of the Baltimore CountyPolice Department.According to her plea agreement, from October 2000 through October 4, 2015, Westmoreland receivedpolydimethylsiloxane, a silicon-based organic polymer that she injected directly into the bodies of victimcustomers for money or some other payment. Westmoreland intentionally defrauded and misled individualsby representing polydimethylsiloxane as “medical grade” silicone and approved for injecting directly into thehuman body. Westmoreland also indicated that she was medically licensed to perform the procedure. Infact, Westmoreland was never a licensed medical practitioner and silicone is not approved by the FDA forthis purpose.As a result of her representations, victim customers came to her residence, or to hotel rooms, to havepolydimethylsiloxane injected directly into their buttocks and other places on their bodies, for larger andfuller buttocks or to shape other areas of their bodies. Westmoreland also traveled to other locations for thesame purpose. Westmoreland typically charged customers $250 to $500 per session, and estimated that shehad injected thousands of customers, who she claimed found her through word of mouth, or through herbusiness website. On October 4, 2015, a search warrant was executed at Westmoreland’s residence. A roomof her home was set up to resemble an operating room, including medical equipment and collages ofphotographs of individuals exposing their buttocks, representing a sampling of those who Westmorelandhad injected with silicone. A forensic search of Westmoreland’s cellular phone revealed 126 individuals listedin her contacts as clients. A financial audit of Westmoreland’s finances for the period from December 2011 toOctober 2015 revealed cash deposits of $227,994.01, and additional deposits of $48,801.06, for a total of$276,795.07. The audit indicated no tax payments and no tax returns filed during that period.Westmoreland admitted that she stored the polydimethylsiloxone in a plastic container that was not properlylabeled for medical use. When injected into humans, liquid silicone is a medical device subject to theregulation of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Polydimethylsiloxane is not approved, exclusivelyor as a component, for body-contouring. Polydimethylsiloxane is used in the manufacture of shampoos (tomake hair shiny and slippery), food (as an antifoaming agent), caulking, lubricants, kinetic sand, andheat-resistant tiles.Westmoreland faces a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. U.S. DistrictJudge Ellen L. Hollander has scheduled sentencing for April 17, 2017, at 10:00 a.m.United States Attorney Rod J.

Perez, Director, Miami-Dade Police Department (MDPD), announced the six year sentence imposed uponMaribel Jimenezfor operating a Miami spa which performed illicit silicone injections.On June 16, 2017, Jimenez previously pled guilty for her participation in a conspiracy and delivery for pay of an adulterated and misbranded device received in interstate commerce with the intent to defraud and mislead.  United States District Judge Kathleen M. Williams sentenced Jimenez to the maximum five year (60 month) sentence for the conspiracy, to be followed by a consecutive term of 19 months in prison for the remaining count of conviction.  In addition, the Court sentenced Jimenez to three years of supervised release and ordered her to forfeit $1,168,353. A restitution hearing has been scheduled for December 1, 2017.According to the court record, including an agreed upon factual statement, Jimenez and her co-defendant, Magaly del Rosario (who is scheduled for sentencing on September 19, 2017, following her previous guilty plea), conspired from 2008 through August 2015 to receive and deliver an adulterated and misbranded “medical device” for pay which consisted of silicone used illegally for body contouring injections. Jimenez further admitted to having unlawfully injected this substance into hundreds of clients seeking buttocks augmentation at Bella Beauty Spa (“Bella Beauty”), a business owned by Jimenez and located at 8360 West Flagler Street in Miami.  The silicone was unlawfully smuggled into the United States from Colombia throughout the period of the criminal conspiracy by means of multiple DHL deliveries of bottles falsely labeled as containing depilatory wax.During the course of the criminal conduct, Jimenez “repeatedly and consistently” informed Bella Beauty’s clients that they would be injected with a substance that was safe, non-permanent and capable of being absorbed by the body over time,” while she “knew this not to be the case.”  Jimenez and her co-defendant falsely claimed that the substance was hydrogel, hyaluronic acid, Juvederm or Restylane, or other such substances.  They did not inform clients that the dermal filler material was in fact silicone, a substance known to be harmful if injected into the human body.  The potentially dangerous and harmful health risks that could result from the injection of the illicit silicone include:the potential of injection into a blood vessel resulting in embolism, migration of injected silicone to other bodily regions, infection and infection-related disorders, silicone-filled scar tissue formations (“granulomas”) caused by the body’s attempt to encapsulate such a foreign substance, necrosis, skin discoloration, immune system hyperactivity and related adverse systemic conditions, disfigurement, discomfort, and pain.Mr. Greenberg commended the investigative efforts of FDA-OCI, ICE-HSI and MDPD.  Mr. Greenberg also thanked U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and the Colombian National Police for their assistance.

Songannounced today.According to the Information, Tony Lee, Billy Lee and Tarn Uppal, all Vancouver, B.C. residents, operated Quantum Solutions, SRL (hereafter, Quantum), a company registered in Barbados. Quantum purchased prescription drugs made for foreign markets and sold wholesale quantities to three pharmacists in Western Pennsylvania. Quantum purchased the drugs from suppliers located in Turkey, Great Britain and other countries. The defendants arranged for these misbranded drugs to be sent to a re-shipper in the United Kingdom (UK). The UK re-shipper was instructed to unpack the drugs, repack them in several small packages, put misleading labeling and shipping documentation on them and understate the dollar value of the contents in order to create the appearance to U.S. Customs and Border Protection that the drugs were health care products for the personal use of the addressee. The small packages were sent to Washington State and New York State re-shippers known to the U.S. Attorney, where they were once again unpacked and repacked for delivery in the United States. Wholesale quantities of these misbranded drugs intended for use in foreign markets were purchased by three pharmacists in Western Pennsylvania. The wire transfers, checks and credit card payments from the pharmacists traveled from Western Pennsylvania to Canada and Barbados. None of the re-shippers were licensed in the United States to conduct this business. None of the prescription drugs met FDA approval because they were made and labeled for use outside of the United States.

HGH cannot be prescribed to help patients with body-building, anti-aging, or weight loss treatments. From April 2014 through June 2015, the evidence showed at trial that Mr. Patino sent numerous packages of HGH to a local St. Louis, Missouri doctor and many local patients. The local patients receiving the HGH hoped to increase their energy, strength, endurance, and athletic ability. The HGH smuggled here to Missouri by Mr. Patino was misbranded in that the drugs’ dosage and use instructions were in Spanish not English, and the drugs came from a Korean drug manufacturer that has not been approved by the U.S. Government to sell this drug in the United States.A local doctor, Dr. Michael “Ted” Mimlitz, previously pled guilty in this same investigation to providing misbranded HGH drugs to numerous local patients who were experiencing a lack of energy, decreases in strength or endurance, or decreased athletic ability.Mr. Patino now faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison for his conspiracy conviction, ten years in prison for his HGH distribution conviction, and twenty years in prison for the smuggling conviction, and/or fines up to $250,000 for each count.

Fishman announced today.“Illegally imported drugs avoid the FDA’s rigorous oversight and manufacturing standards,” U.S. Attorney Fishman said. “Health care providers who import those drugs are exposing their patients to serious risks of harm from contaminated or counterfeit products.”“Patients receiving cancer treatment drugs should be assured that the medications meet FDA’s standards for safety and quality,” Jeffrey J. Ebersole, special agent in charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ New York Field Office, said. “OCI will continue its vigilance over the prescription drug supply chain to ensure that the drugs reaching patients comply with federal law, and that those who attempt to circumvent the agency’s oversight will be brought to justice.”The settlement announced today resolves allegations that The Oncology Practice of Dr. Kenneth D. Nahum, Nahum himself, and his wife, Ann Walsh, of Colts Neck, New Jersey, ordered cancer drugs from a foreign distributor. From April 1, 2010, until January 31, 2011, Walsh allegedly ordered chemotherapy drugs from the foreign distributor for use at the practice, which was owned by Nahum and operated in Howell, New Jersey, and Wall, New Jersey. These drugs had not been approved by FDA for sale in the United States.Doctors at the practice allegedly injected the drugs into their patients, and the practice then submitted claims to Medicare for reimbursement for the drugs and infusion services.

The United States further alleged that the Sens purchased unapproved drugs because they were less expensive than the drugs approved by FDA for marketing in the United States. The Sens thus allegedly profitted by administering the cheaper unapproved drugs.The United States’ investigation was a coordinated effort by the Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Tennessee, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of General Counsel, the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations and Office of Chief Counsel, the FBI’s Knoxville Division and the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.Claims settled by this agreement are allegations only; there has been no determination of liability.Topic(s):False Claims ActComponent(s):Civil DivisionUSAO - Tennessee, EasternPress Release Number:17-712"

Gerson is scheduled to make his initial appearance this afternoon in United States District Court in Los Angeles.Gerson was arrested pursuant to a two-count criminal complaint filed on December 6. The complaint alleges that Gerson delivered into interstate commerce two misbranded drugs: Comfortis, an anti-flea medication, and ciprofloxacin, a powerful antibiotic commonly called “Cipro” that can be used in dogs and cats to treat skin, respiratory and urinary tract infections. The complaint, which contains one felony count and one misdemeanor count, alleges that the drugs were knowingly dispensed without a prescription.The affidavit in support of the complaint alleges that Gerson sold Comfortis that was designed for the South African market and was not approved for distribution in the United States.“Uncontrolled distribution of antibiotics and medication pose a threat to public safety, including the fostering of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria,” said United States Attorney Eileen M. Decker. “The drugs involved in this case allegedly were distributed without the supervision of a licensed professional, which greatly increases the risk of unintended consequences beyond the animals taking the medication.”According the affidavit, Gerson allegedly used several websites – includingwww.fleastuff.com [external link],www.mydoghasfleas.xyz [external link]andwww.fleaandtickstuff.com [external link]– to market prescription animal products to buyers without valid prescriptions, rendering the medications misbranded. Additionally, federal law prohibits the importation and sale of veterinary medicines that have not been approved by the FDA and EPA for use in this country.In conjunction with Gerson’s arrest, federal investigators executed a search warrant at a Laguna Hills storage unit linked to Gerson, where they seized a variety of veterinary prescription products.A criminal complaint contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty in court.If he is convicted of two counts in the complaint, Gerson would face a statutory maximum sentence of four years in federal prison.This week’s arrest marks the second time Gerson has been linked to the illegal sale of pet medications and products. He pleaded guilty in Harris County, Texas, in 2014 to state charges of delivery of a dangerous drug, specifically a prescription drug called Clenbuterol. According to the affidavit filed in connection with this week’s charges, following that conviction, Gerson agreed to work as a confidential informant for authorities, with the stipulation he could not sell animal prescription drug products.The case against Gerson is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Joseph O.

Kim, the Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Carl J. Kotowski, the Special Agent-in-Charge of the New Jersey Division of the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), announced that MAURICE MALIN pled guilty today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Andrew J. Peck to conspiring to illegally sell over 5 million prescription Butalbital pills to customers across the United States who did not have valid prescriptions for the drugs. MALIN also agreed today to forfeit $9 million to the United States, which represented his proceeds from the illegal scheme. MALIN’s case is before U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood.Acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim said: “As Maurice Malin admitted today in court, he made millions of dollars illegally dispensing drugs over the Internet to customers who had no valid prescriptions and had never seen a doctor. Pharmacists entrusted with the sale of controlled substances must safeguard the health of consumers, not scheme to profit from illegal drug sales.”DEA Special Agent-in-Charge Carl J. Kotowski said: “Unfortunately, this is another example of a pharmacist who was more interested in making fast money than he was in helping the public. His actions help to erode the public’s trust in those in positions of responsibility.”According to the allegations contained in the Complaint and the Information filed against MALIN and statements made in court filings and proceedings, including at today’s guilty plea:MAURICE MALIN, the defendant, was a licensed pharmacist who operated pharmacies in the Bronx, New York (the “Malin Pharmacies”). Between at least March 2014 and July 2016, MALIN engaged in a scheme to dispense Butalbital, a Schedule III controlled substance, to customers who had not consulted with a physician and did not possess a valid prescription for the drug. Specifically, customers ordered Butalbital pills by filling out online medical questionnaires that typically posed a series of “yes” or “no” questions (the “Prescription Websites”). Customers ordered the drugs on the Prescription Websites without ever seeing or speaking to a physician or medical practitioner and without obtaining a valid prescription.After the orders were placed by customers on the Prescription Websites, these orders were then sent to pharmacies, including the Malin Pharmacies, that dispensed the prescription drugs to customers. The Malin Pharmacies filled the prescriptions for customers who had placed orders via the Prescription Websites, and then sent the drugs, specifically Butalbital, through the mail to customers located across the United States. Customers paid for the drugs by, among other means, money orders made out to business entities associated with the Malin Pharmacies and MALIN.During the course of the investigation, undercover agents made numerous purchases of Butalbital on the Prescription Websites that were fulfilled by the Malin Pharmacies. In certain instances, MALIN’s name was listed as the fulfilling pharmacist on the Butalbital bottles agents received. In addition, many of the bottles that were received as a result of the undercover buys did not bear the name of any doctor who had prescribed the Butalbital, and instead repeated the name of the patient in the location on the label where the doctor’s name should have appeared had there been a valid prescription. MALIN was also captured on recorded phone calls with undercover agents acknowledging that he was aware that customers who placed orders on the Prescription Websites had not met with or consulted with a physician prior to placing their online order.MALIN was arrested on August 10, 2016.* * *MALIN, 83, of Suffern, New York, pled guilty today to conspiring to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute a controlled substance, which carries a maximum term of 10 years in prison. The maximum potential sentence in this case is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the judge. MALIN’s sentencing date will be set by Judge Wood.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseNovember 10, 2016United States Department of JusticeCentral District of CaliforniaSANTA ANA, California– A registered nurse who owned and operated a day spa in Laguna Niguel has agreed to plead guilty to a federal charge related to the illegal distribution of Botox that was not approved for use in the United States.Bridget “Gigi” Goddard, 50, of Dana Point, who owned Pure Indulgence Skin Rejuvenation in Laguna Niguel, has agreed to plead guilty to one count of receipt and delivery of a misbranded drug, a crime that carries a statutory maximum penalty of three years in federal prison.Federal prosecutors today filed a criminal information against Goddard, as well as a plea agreement in which she agrees to plead guilty to the felony offense.“Drugs and medical devices are regulated to protect the American public,” said United States Attorney Eileen M. Decker. “Those who circumvent those regulations pose a very real risk to patients who could be subject to unsafe products that can do serious harm.”All Botox products approved for distribution in the United States by the United States Food and Drug Administration are manufactured by Allergan and must be administered under the supervision of a licensed physician. Goddard admitted in her plea agreement that, over the course of several years, she ordered Botox over the internet from Canadian companies that sold unapproved drugs to customers in the United States. (One of those companies, SB Medical Inc., pleaded guilty in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, andwas ordered to pay a $45 million fineand to forfeit $30 million for smuggle misbranded pharmaceuticals into the United States.) The Botox that Goddard purchased had been manufactured for distribution in foreign nations such as Turkey and was not approved by the FDA for distribution in the United States.In April 2016, Goddard offered to administer Botox to a person she thought was a Pure Indulgence customer, but who in fact was an undercover agent with the FDA. Goddard told the undercover agent that the undercover agent did not need to be examined by a physician before the Botox injections were administered, and Goddard knowingly misled the agent as to whether the Botox was approved for use in the United States.“Consumers rely on FDA oversight to ensure that the drugs they take are safe and effective. When criminals attempt to distribute unapproved drugs in the U.S. marketplace, they put the public's health at risk,” said Lisa Malinowski, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations. “Our office will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who would jeopardize the health and safety of the public.”Goddard has agreed to make her first appearance in this case in United States District Court in Santa Ana on December 12.The investigation into Goddard was conducted by FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigation. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Scott D. Tenley of the Santa Ana branch office.Component(s):USAO - California, Central"

Stuart announced that on Tuesday, March 28, 2017, co-defendants Allen E. Peithman, Jr., Sharon A. Elder, and their corporations, Cornerstone Plaza, Inc., and AEP Properties, L.L.C., were each convicted of at least one crime after a three-week-long jury trial. Peithman, his mother, Elder, and their respective corporations operated two “head shops” in Lincoln. They operated Dirt Cheap between October of 2013 and August of 2015, and Island Smokes between September of 2014 and April of 2015. In April of 2015, a number of drug overdoses were attributed to the sale of “potpourri” in Lincoln. Island Smokes was selling “potpourri,” also known as “K2” during that time. This led to the execution of a search warrant in April of 2015 during which over 500 packets of “potpourri” and hundreds of pieces of drug paraphernalia were seized. In August of 2015, a search warrant was served at Dirt Cheap, and additional drug paraphernalia was seized.Peithman was convicted of conspiracy to distribute drug paraphernalia; investment of drug proceeds; conspiracy to distribute misbranded substances; conspiracy to commit mail fraud; conspiracy to structure financial transactions; and commission of an offense while on supervised release. Peithman’s corporation, AEP Properties, L.L.C., was also convicted of the conspiracy to structure. Elder and her corporation, Cornerstone Plaza, Inc., were convicted of conspiracy to distribute drug paraphernalia; investment of drug proceeds; conspiracy to distribute misbranded substances; conspiracy to commit mail fraud; and conspiracy to structure.After the verdict was returned, additional evidence was presented, and the jury was instructed with respect to consideration of forfeiture allegations seeking forfeiture of real estate, cars, bank accounts, and products used in the above-listed crimes. On March 29, 2017, the jury returned a verdict forfeiting the business checking account for Cornerstone Plaza, Inc., as well as all the misbranded drugs and drug paraphernalia seized from the businesses. The Indictment also included an allegation that a money judgment should be entered against the defendants, and that matter is set for hearing on April 24, 2017.The conspiracy to commit mail fraud charge carries a possible penalty of up to 20 years in prison. Investment of drug proceeds and conspiracy to commit structuring each carry possible penalties of up to 10 years in prison. Conspiracy to distribute drug paraphernalia and conspiracy to distribute misbranded drugs each carry penalties of up to three years in prison. The crime of committing a felony while on supervised release for which Peithman was convicted carries a possible sentence of up to 10 years consecutive to any other sentence. The corporations face fines of up to $1,000,000 on the structuring conviction. Sentencing for all defendants is scheduled for June 20, 2017.This case was investigated by the Lincoln/Lancaster County Drug Task Force, the Food and Drug Administration, Homeland Security Investigations, and the Nebraska State Patrol. In response to the verdict, Special Agent in Charge William Conway, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Chicago Field Office, said,“Drugs that are produced and distributed outside the FDA’s oversight put consumers at risk of being harmed. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to prevent such drugs from reaching the market and to bring to justice those who endanger American consumers by circumventing FDA's regulatory process.\"USAO - NebraskaTopic:Drug TraffickingFinancial Fraud"

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseJanuary 12, 2017United States Department of JusticeCompany Failed to Follow Good Manufacturing Practices in North Carolina FacilityHealthcare company Baxter Healthcare Corporation (Baxter) has agreed to pay $18.158 million to resolve its criminal and civil liability arising from Baxter’s failure to follow current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) when manufacturing sterile drug products in North Carolina, the Department of Justice announced today. Today’s resolution includes a deferred prosecution agreement and penalties and forfeiture totaling $16 million and a civil settlement under the False Claims Act (FCA) with the federal government totaling approximately $2.158 million. Baxter is a Delaware corporation and subsidiary of Baxter International Inc., headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois, with many manufacturing facilities throughout the United States and the world, including one in Marion, North Carolina (North Cove).In a criminal information filed today in the Western District of North Carolina, the government charged that, between July 2011 and November 2012, Baxter introduced into interstate commerce drugs that were adulterated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) because Baxter did not follow cGMP when making those products. At North Cove, Baxter manufactured large-volume sterile intravenous (IV) solutions in a clean room that had high-efficiency particulate absorption (HEPA) filters installed in the ceiling. Air was pushed into the clean room through the HEPA filters. As alleged in the information, during the relevant time period, a Baxter employee reported the presence of mold on the HEPA filters to plant management. However, Baxter continued to manufacture IV solutions in that clean room for months while the filters the employee had identified as moldy remained in place. Subsequent testing of the filters following an unannounced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspection revealed several mold species on the filters. There was no evidence of impact on the IV solutions from the mold found on the filters.In a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve the charge, Baxter admitted that it distributed products in interstate commerce that were adulterated in violation of the FDCA. Under the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement, Baxter will pay a total of $16 million in monetary penalties and forfeiture and will implement enhanced compliance provisions, including periodic certifications to the government concerning its implementation of those provisions. The deferred prosecution agreement will not be final until accepted by the U.S. District Court.“Following current Good Manufacturing Practices is essential to ensure the safety and efficacy of our drugs,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “Today’s settlement shows that the government will continue to hold companies accountable for failing to fulfill this critically important responsibility.”“Despite notification by an employee of potential contamination concerns, Baxter was poorly focused on instituting sufficient safety standards for their products,” said U.S. Attorney Jill Westmoreland Rose for the Western District of North Carolina (WDNC). “Today’s resolution reflects WDNC’s commitment to hold accountable drug companies that violate manufacturing standards and wrongly profit from those violations.”“FDA’s manufacturing standards are designed to ensure the quality, safety, and efficacy of drugs distributed to American consumers, and FDA expects pharmaceutical companies to correct deficiencies in an expedited manner,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin Green of FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, Miami Field Office. “We will remain vigilant in our efforts to protect the U.S. public health from potentially dangerous products.”In addition, Baxter will pay approximately $2.158 million to resolve allegations that the company violated the FCA by submitting false claims to the Department of Veterans Affairs based upon Baxter’s failure to follow cGMPs.The civil settlement resolves a lawsuit filed by Christopher Wall, an employee of Baxter, under the whistleblower provision of the False Claims Act, which permits private parties to file suit on behalf of the United States for false claims and share in a portion of the government’s recovery. The civil lawsuit was filed in the Western District of North Carolina and is captioned United States ex rel. Christopher Wall v. Baxter International, Inc. et al., No. 13cv42 (W.D.N.C.). Mr. Wall will receive $431,535.99 from the proceeds of the civil settlement.This settlement illustrates the government’s emphasis on combating health care fraud and marks another achievement for the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT) initiative, which was announced in May 2009 by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The partnership between the two departments has focused efforts to reduce and prevent Medicare and Medicaid financial fraud through enhanced cooperation. One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act. Since January 2009, the Justice Department has recovered a total of more than $31.4 billion through False Claims Act cases, with nearly $19.6 billion of that amount recovered in cases involving fraud against federal health care programs.The settlement with Baxter was the result of a coordinated effort among the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of North Carolina and the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch and Commercial Litigation Branch, with assistance from the FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel. The criminal investigation was conducted by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations.Except as to conduct admitted in connection with the deferred prosecution agreement, the claims settled by the civil agreement are allegations only and there has been no determination of civil liability.For more information about the Consumer Protection Branch and its enforcement efforts, visit its website athttp://www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch.

Greenberg, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida; Justin D. Green, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI), Miami Field Office; Mark Selby, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-HSI), Miami Field Office; and Juan J. Perez, Director, Miami-Dade Police Department (MDPD), announced the fifty-six month prison sentence imposed uponMagaly Del Rosariofor managing a Miami spa which performed illicit silicone injections.On July 6, 2017, Del Rosario previously pled guilty for her participation in a conspiracy and delivery for pay of an adulterated and misbranded device received in interstate commerce with the intent to defraud and mislead.  Yesterday, United States District Judge Kathleen M. Williams sentenced Del Rosario to 50 months in prison for the conspiracy, to be followed by 6 months in prison for the remaining count of conviction.  In addition, Del Rosario was sentenced to three years of supervised release. A restitution hearing has been scheduled for December 1, 2017.According to the court record, including an agreed upon factual statement, Del Rosario and her co-defendant, Maribel Jimenez (who previously pled guilty and was sentenced on August 29, 2017, to 79 months in prison), conspired from 2008 through August 2015 to receive and deliver an adulterated and misbranded “medical device” for pay which consisted of silicone used illegally for body contouring injections.  Del Rosario further admitted to having assisted Jimenez, in unlawfully injecting this substance into hundreds of clients seeking buttocks augmentation at Bella Beauty Spa (“Bella Beauty”), a business owned by Jimenez and located at 8360 West Flagler Street in Miami.  The silicone was unlawfully smuggled into the United States from Colombia throughout the period of the criminal conspiracy by means of multiple DHL deliveries of bottles falsely labeled as containing depilatory wax.During the course of the criminal conduct, Del Rosario “repeatedly and consistently” informed Bella Beauty’s clients that they would be injected with a substance that was safe, non-permanent and capable of being absorbed by the body over time,” while she “knew this not to be the case.”  Del Rosario and Jimenez falsely claimed that the substance was hydrogel, hyaluronic acid, Juvederm, Restylane, or other such absorbable, time-limited substances.  They did not inform clients that the dermal filler material was in fact silicone, a permanent substance known to be harmful if injected into the human body.  The potentially dangerous and harmful health risks that could result from the injection of the illicit silicone include: the potential of injection into a blood vessel resulting in embolism, migration of injected silicone to other bodily regions, infection and infection-related disorders, silicone-filled scar tissue formations (“granulomas”) caused by the body’s attempt to encapsulate such a foreign substance, necrosis, skin discoloration, immune system hyperactivity and related adverse systemic conditions, disfigurement, discomfort, and pain.Mr. Greenberg commended the investigative efforts of FDA-OCI, ICE-HSI and MDPD.  Mr. Greenberg thanked U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Colombian National Police for their assistance.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseMay 23, 2017United States Department of JusticeDistrict of New HampshireCONCORD, N.H. -Mustafa Hasan Arif, 37, an individual with dual citizenship in Pakistan and the United Kingdom, was sentenced to serve six years in federal prison for his role in an extensive international wire fraud scheme, Acting United States Attorney John J. Farley announced today.According to court documents and statements in court proceedings, Arif defrauded individuals all around the world by selling drugs that he claimed would cure many serious diseases. While in Lahore, Pakistan, Arif created, maintained, and controlled over 1,500 websites that promoted the sale of the drugs. The websites claimed that the drugs would cure and treat hundreds of diseases, many of which were incurable, including cerebral palsy, mental retardation, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and emphysema. The websites included falsified cure rates, false clinical research, and fabricated testimonials. One series of websites fraudulently claimed that Arif’s products had shown a 90 percent cure rate in clinical trials. Other websites included links to clinical research that had not been written about the drugs on the websites, but which suggested that clinical research had been performed on the products Arif was distributing. In an effort to make customers comfortable about the products, Arif also falsely represented that the drugs were being sold by entities in Germany, Norway, Italy, Australia, New Zealand, and Denmark when in fact the drugs were all being sold and shipped from Pakistan. Documents in the case show that Arif ‘s scheme generated more than $12.8 million in fraudulent sales to more than 100,000 victims.Arif initially was arrested after he flew into New York in February 2014 on a business trip. He appeared in federal court in New York and later was transported to New Hampshire, where he has remained in custody. He pleaded guilty to wire fraud on October 11, 2016.“The defendant’s conduct was reprehensible,” Acting U.S. Attorney Farley said. “He preyed on vulnerable individuals who were seeking to find cures for illnesses that often had no known cure. His scheme not only defrauded his victims financially but also victimized them emotionally by raising false hopes that his products could treat their serious medical conditions. Rather than providing his sick customers with remedies for their illnesses, he only caused more pain. I commend the law enforcement officers who put an end to this dangerous and heartless scheme.”“Criminals who deceive U.S. consumers with false information and false claims about drugs can adversely affect the public’s health,” said Jeffrey J. Ebersole, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ New York Field Office. “Our office will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who take advantage of consumers in their quest for profits.”This investigation was led by the FDA/Office of Criminal Investigations, Cybercrime Investigations Unit along with Homeland Security Investigations. Assistance during the investigation was provided by the New Hampshire Attorney General’s Office, Portsmouth New Hampshire Police Department, the United States Consulate, Diplomatic Security Service Lagos, Nigeria office, New Zealand Ministry of Health, United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, and the Department of Justice, Office of International Affairs. The investigation was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Arnold H. Huftalen and Sarah Hawkins of the FDA/Office of Chief Counsel.###Topic(s):StopFraudComponent(s):USAO - New Hampshire"

Kuhn, Jr. today announced the guilty pleas to a criminal information made on April 17, 2017 by SCM True Air Technologies, Inc. and the former company president John N. Keesaer, in United States District Court before Magistrate Judge Dave Whalin.SCM True Air pled guilty to one count of operating an establishment that manufactured medical devices without having properly registered that establishment as required by law.Keesaer pled guilty to one count of obstruction of an FDA investigation and one count of introducing misbranded medical devices into commerce.“This company and its former president sold defective and unusable beds to the VA,” stated U.S. Attorney John Kuhn. “Our veterans deserve far better consideration and treatment.These defendants will be held accountable for breaking the law then attempting to cover that up.”\"Defrauding VA by providing unregistered and substandard bariatric beds for use by our nation's veterans is inexcusable,\" saidKim Lampkins, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Inspector General, Mid-Atlantic Field Office. “This investigation demonstrates that the VA OIG, working with our colleagues in law enforcement, will aggressively pursue those who place our nation’s veterans at risk for their own private gain.”“FDA’s ability to protect the public health relies on regulated industries fulfilling their responsibilities to comply with FDA requirements,” said Mark S. McCormack, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Office. “Those who attempt to circumvent FDA’s regulatory process put consumers’ health at risk and this will not be tolerated.”According to separate plea agreements, beginning at least as early as 2010 and continuing until September 2012, John N. Keesaer, acting as president of SCM True Air, delivered bariatric hospital beds, which are Class II medical devices, that were misbranded due to the fact that they were manufactured in an establishment that was not registered with the FDA as required by law.Further, on January 29, 2014, Keesaer corruptly obstructed an FDA compliance inspection regarding SCM True Air’s production methods including facilities that produced bariatric beds.Specifically, while Keesaer was President of SCM True Air, the company’s manufacturing process for bariatric hospital beds involved establishments in both Roseville, Ohio, and Louisville, Kentucky, that the company had not properly registered with the FDA to produce Class II medical devices, despite the fact that Keesaer and the company had been previously advised on repeated occasions that such registration was required by law.Starting in at least 2010, SCM True Air produced medical devices such as bariatric beds at its Louisville and Roseville establishments without properly registering the establishments with the FDA for over two and a half years. As a result of the fact that the bariatric beds were manufactured at establishments that were not duly registered with the FDA, those beds were misbranded in violation of federal law.At Keesaer’s direction and under his supervision, SCM True Air then sold and delivered misbranded bariatric beds from its Louisville and Roseville establishments to purchasers throughout theUnited States.Keesaer personally participated in the delivery of misbranded bariatric beds from SCM True Air to various facilities.In 2012, SCM True Air entered into a contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs to deliver 48 bariatric beds, mattresses and accessories to the Trinka Davis Veterans Village in Carrollton, Georgia, a unit of the Atlanta V.A. Medical Center.SCM True Air was paid $211,691.62 for the beds despite the fact that, unknown at the time to the Department of Veterans Affairs, those beds were produced by SCM True Air both using parts from the Louisville establishment and further manufactured in the Roseville establishment.During the process of manufacturing the 48 bariatric beds for the contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs, Keesaer stated to others that the SCM True Air establishments were registered with the FDA when, as he then in fact knew, they were not. Further, upon delivery to the V.A. medical center in September 2012, the bariatric beds were substantially defective, as many of the beds had caulking and welding issues, rusting parts and dirt affixed to them.As a result of these defects, the beds were entirely unusable by the patients at the Veterans Village.The FDA subsequently initiated a formal compliance investigation regarding SCM True Air’s alleged adulteration and misbranding of bariatric beds.During that investigation, Keesaer, acting as President of the company, intentionally obstructed the compliance investigation by making a materially false written statement in the course of that investigation.If convicted at trial, Keesaer would face a combined maximum term of six years in prison, a maximum fine of the greater of $350,000 or twice the gross gain to the defendant or loss to victims resulting from his offense, and a four-year term of supervised release.If the company were convicted at trial it would face a maximum fine of the greater of $500,000 or twice the gross gain to the company or loss to victims resulting from its offense.Also, if convicted at trial, both Keesaer and the company would be obligated to pay restitution to any victims of their offenses.According to the terms of its plea agreement, SCM True Air has agreed to pay restitution in the amount of $211,691.62 and a fine of $500,000.  According to the terms of his plea agreement, Keesaer is jointly liable for the same amount of restitution, and the United States has agreed to recommend a sentence of probation and a fine at the time of his sentencing hearing.Sentencing is scheduled before Senior District Judge Thomas B. Russell on July 17, 2017, in Louisville.Assistant United States Attorneys Stephanie M. Zimdahl and H. Joseph Pinto III are prosecuting this case. The United States Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations and Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Inspector General, Mid-Atlantic Field Office, are investigating."

Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Daniel G. Bogden of the District of Nevada and Director George M. Karavetsos of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations made the announcement.Dmitriy V. Melnik, of Las Vegas, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge James C. Mahan of the District of Nevada  to one count of conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit goods and to introduce into interstate commerce misbranded devices.According to the plea agreement, Melnik imported large quantities of colored contact lenses from the People’s Republic of China and South Korea that he knew were counterfeit and/or unauthorized by the FDA for sale in the United States.  Many of these contact lenses bore labels with counterfeit trademarks for Ciba Vision FreshLook COLORBLENDS, which are manufactured by Novartis International AG, and others had labels of brands of contact lenses produced and sold in Asia, he admitted.As noted in the plea agreement, all contact lenses are medical devices that must receive FDA authorization to enter the United States and be further distributed.  Melnik sold “authentic” contact lenses to tens of thousands of customers around the United States without a prescription, adequate directions for use and adequate warnings.  After purchasing the contact lenses, many customers complained directly to Melnik about the quality of the contact lenses and questioned Melnik about whether the contact lenses were genuine and FDA approved, according to the plea agreement.  Melnik admitted that some of the contact lenses he sold were tested and found to be contaminated with potentially hazardous bacteria.As stated in the plea agreement, a substantial part of the fraudulent scheme was committed from outside the United States, and Melnik received at least $1.2 million in gross revenue from this illegal enterprise, including approximately $200,000 alone from the sale of counterfeit Ciba Vision FreshLook COLORBLENDS.Anyone with information about individuals committing intellectual property offenses can report those crimes to the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center by going tohttp://www.iprcenter.gov/referralor calling (866) IPR-2060.The prosecution is the result of an ongoing multiagency effort to combat counterfeit, illegally imported and unapproved contact lenses called Operation Double Vision.  The FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations led the investigation, with significant support from the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations.  Senior Counsel Matthew A.

Cowhig of the District of Nevada are prosecuting the case.The indictment is related to the many efforts being undertaken by the department’s Task Force on Intellectual Property, which supports prosecution priorities, promotes innovation through heightened civil enforcement, enhances coordination among federal, state and local law enforcement partners and focuses on international enforcement efforts, including reinforcing relationships with key foreign partners and U.S. industry leaders.16-1031Criminal DivisionUSAO - NevadaTopic:Intellectual Property"

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseNovember 7, 2016United States Department of JusticePennsylvania-based medical device manufacturer Biocompatibles Inc., a subsidiary of BTG plc, pleaded guilty today to misbranding its embolic device LC Bead and will pay more than $36 million to resolve criminal and civil liability arising out of its illegal conduct, the Justice Department announced today. LC Bead is used to treat liver cancer, among other diseases.As part of the criminal resolution, Biocompatibles will pay an $8.75 million criminal fine for the misbranding of LC Bead and a criminal forfeiture of $2.25 million.  The FDA sought assurances in 2004 that Biocompatibles would not use FDA clearance for the device for embolization to market the device for drug delivery, according to a statement of offense to which the company agreed.  Biocompatibles told the FDA that “under no circumstance” would the company use the embolization clearance to market the device for drug delivery.  However, two years later, Biocompatibles began marketing LC Bead for drug delivery through the company it hired to carry out its sales and distribution in the United States.  According to the statement of offense, the distribution company told its sales representatives that LC Bead was “[a] drug-delivery device” and trained its sales representatives to “aggressively penetrate the chemoembolization market.”  Sales representatives subsequently told health care providers that the device increased the level of chemotherapy delivered to a liver tumor and resulted in “better tumor response rates,” despite the lack of FDA clearance or approval for that use and despite the absence at that time of statistically significant evidence to support such claims.“The FDA approval process serves an important role in ensuring that federal health care participants receive devices that are safe, effective and medically appropriate,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.  “We will not permit companies to circumvent that process and put profits over patient safety.”“This company is being held criminally and civilly responsible for misbranding a medical device and marketing it for the treatment of seriously ill cancer patients,” said U.S. Attorney Channing D. Phillips for the District of Columbia. “Working with the FDA and other law enforcement partners, we are committed to holding companies accountable for violating the integrity of the FDA approval process.”In addition, Biocompatibles will pay $25 million to resolve civil allegations under the False Claims Act that the company caused false claims to be submitted to government healthcare programs for procedures in which LC Bead was loaded with chemotherapy drugs and used as a drug-delivery device.  When LC Bead was combined with prescription drugs for use as a drug-eluting bead, it constituted a new combination drug-device product that was not approved or cleared by the FDA and not covered by Medicare and other federal health care programs.  The federal share of the civil settlement is approximately $23.6 million, and the state Medicaid share of the civil settlement is approximately $1.4 million.As part of the civil settlement, the government alleged that when LC Bead entered the U.S. market in 2005, Biocompatibles intended for LC Bead to be used as a drug-delivery device in combination with chemotherapy drugs, despite the lack of FDA approval as a drug-device combination product.  In December 2009, Biocompatibles filed an application with FDA for approval of LC Bead as a drug-eluting bead combination product. However, FDA informed the company that it was not accepting the application because clinical studies did not provide adequate evidence of a therapeutic benefit.  Nonetheless, Biocompatibles’ distributor routinely advised healthcare providers that LC Bead provided “better” or “superior” therapy for certain types of cancer when, in fact, there was insufficient clinical evidence to support these claims.“The FDA plays a fundamental role in ensuring the safety and efficacy of medical devices and drugs in this country,” said U.S. Attorney Richard L. Durbin Jr. of the Western District of Texas. “The FDA approval process and clinical studies serve to ensure that patients receive devices that meet those standards.  We will vigorously pursue those who ignore or seek to circumvent these important patient protections.”“U.S. consumers rely on the FDA to ensure that there is a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the approved uses of medical devices,” said Director George M. Karavetsos of FDA Office of Criminal Investigations. “When manufacturers ignore FDA’s regulatory authority, they undermine these important assurances.”The civil settlement with Biocompatibles resolves a lawsuit filed under the whistleblower provision of the False Claims Act, which permits private parties to file suit on behalf of the United States for false claims and share in a portion of the government’s recovery.  The civil lawsuit was filed in the Western District of Texas and is captionedUnited States ex rel. Ryan Bliss v. Biocompatibles, Inc., et al.As part of today’s resolution, Bliss will receive approximately $5.1 million from the civil settlement.This settlement illustrates the government’s emphasis on combating health care fraud and marks another achievement for the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT) initiative, which was announced in May 2009 by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  The partnership between the two departments has focused efforts to reduce and prevent Medicare and Medicaid financial fraud through enhanced cooperation.  One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act.  Since January 2009, the Justice Department has recovered a total of more than $31.6 billion through False Claims Act cases, with more than $19.2 billion of that amount recovered in cases involving fraud against federal health care programs.The settlement with Biocompatibles was the result of a coordinated effort among the U.S. Attorney’s Offices for the District of Columbia and the Western District of Texas, and the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch and Commercial Litigation Branch, with assistance from the FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel, HHS’ Office of Counsel to the Inspector General and the Department of Defense’s Defense Criminal Investigative Service.  The criminal investigation was conducted by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations.Except for the conduct admitted in connection with the criminal plea, the claims resolved by the civil settlement are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability.For more information about the Consumer Protection Branch and its enforcement efforts, visit its website athttp://www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch.  For more information on the Commercial Litigation Branch’s Fraud Section, visithttps://www.justice.gov/civil/fraud-section.16-1301Civil DivisionDownload Compliance Program and CertificationsDownload InformationDownload Plea AgreementDownload Statement of Offense"

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseDecember 7, 2016United States Department of JusticeThe world’s largest dietary supplement retailer, GNC Holdings Inc. (GNC), has entered into a wide-ranging agreement with the Department of Justice to reform its practices related to potentially unlawful dietary ingredients and dietary supplements, and has further promised to embark on a series of voluntary initiatives designed to improve the quality and purity of dietary supplements, the Department of Justice announced today.  The non-prosecution agreement resolves GNC’s liability for selling certain dietary supplements produced by a firm currently under indictment.  As part of the agreement, GNC has agreed to pay $2.25 million to the U.S. government and cooperate in dietary supplement investigations conducted by the government.A lengthy investigation conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas, and the Consumer Protection Branch of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division revealed that GNC’s practices related to ensuring the legality of products on its shelves were lacking.According to an agreed-upon statement of facts that accompanies the non-prosecution agreement, GNC engaged in acts and omissions that allowed a misbranded supplement— OxyElite Pro Advanced Formula, a product of Dallas-based USPlabs LLC (USP Labs)—to be sold at GNC locations nationwide in 2013.  The statement of facts notes that GNC sold the product based on representations from USP Labs that ingredients contained in the product complied with the law.  It further notes that GNC did not undertake additional testing or require additional certifications to confirm such representations or to verify that the ingredients in the product were as represented.USP Labs wasindictedin November 2015 and is awaiting trial.  The indictment alleges, among other things, that USP Labs engaged in a conspiracy to import ingredients from China using false certificates of analysis and false labeling, and then lied about the source and nature of those ingredients after it put them in its products.  According to the indictment, USP Labs told some of its retailers and wholesalers that it used natural plant extracts in some of its products, when in fact it was using synthetic stimulants manufactured in a Chinese chemical factory.Today’s resolution requires GNC to commit to certain changes designed to prevent unlawful dietary supplements from reaching its shelves:First, GNC has agreed that, upon learning that the FDA has issued a public written notice indicating that a purported dietary supplement or an ingredient contained in a purported dietary supplement is not legal and/or not safe, GNC will take immediate action to suspend the sale of such a product or products.Second, GNC will establish two lists—a “restricted list” containing ingredients that are not to be used in dietary supplements and a “positive list” containing ingredients that are approved for sale.  Although GNC has agreed that the lists it creates will not have the force of law, GNC will use these lists to guide the company in determining what products it will approve for sale.  Products containing novel ingredients that do not appear on either list will, GNC agreed, require further internal action and approval before being offered for sale.Third, GNC will substantially revise its internal approach to dealing with the vendors whose products GNC sells, including requiring more explicit guarantees from its vendors that their products do not contain ingredients on the “restricted list” and that their products comply with federal law.Fourth, GNC will voluntarily work to develop an industry-wide quality seal program.  When this quality seal is implemented, GNC has agreed to stop paying its retail salespeople bonus commissions, or “promotional money,” to direct customers to products in its stores not carrying the seal.Finally, GNC will update its adverse event reporting policy to ensure that its employees understand the proper procedures to employ if a customer complains of injuries associated with a dietary supplement bought at GNC.“Unlawful dietary supplements are an important enforcement priority for the department,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “Today’s resolution is a significant step forward in reforming an industry rife with alarming practices. Companies like GNC need to do more to ensure that they are not selling products containing questionable and untested ingredients.  The American public deserves better, and the Department of Justice appreciates GNC’s efforts in resolving its issues and moving forward in the best interests of American consumers.”“I am pleased with this agreement and hold steadfast that those engaged in the sale of dietary supplements to the public must adhere to higher standards to ensure consumers are protected from lax business practices that could endanger them,” said U.S. Attorney John R. Parker of the Northern District of Texas.“Protecting the public from unsafe ingredients in dietary supplements is one of FDA’s most important responsibilities,” said Director George M. Karavetsos of FDA Office of Criminal Investigations. “We will continue to work with industry to ensure that supplements distributed in the U.S. marketplace do not contain harmful ingredients.”The matter was handled by Consumer Protection Branch Trial Attorneys David Sullivan and Patrick Runkle, and Northern District of Texas Assistant U.S. Attorney Errin Martin.  FDA Office of Chief Counsel Attorneys Nathan Sabel and Michael Shane supported the matter, which was investigated by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Dallas Domicile.Today’s action is part of the government’s efforts, in collaboration with the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences’ Consortium for Health and Military Performance (CHAMP), to provide educational resources for service members and the general public to protect them from risky dietary supplements. Through its Operation Supplement Safety (OPSS), and in partnership with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) and Supplement 411, OPSS provides important information to service members and consumers about dietary supplements.  In 2015, OPSS launched a High-Risk Supplement List mobile application (accessible on iOS and Android).

Rohde, Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York; Mark S. McCormack, Special Agent-in-Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Metro Washington Field Office;  Scott J. Lampert, Special Agent-in-Charge, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS OIG), New York Region; Leigh-Alistair Barzey, Special Agent-in Charge, Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), Northeast Field Office; and Scott Rezendes, Special Agent-in-Charge,  Office of Personnel Management, Office of Inspector General (OPM-OIG).“Today’s guilty plea demonstrates our commitment to investigating and holding accountable any pharmaceutical company that fails to ensure the health and safety of the public.  This Office will continue to work actively with the FDA to ensure that those responsible for America’s drug supply scrupulously comply with the law and provide safe products that doctors and patients can trust,” said Acting United States Attorney Rohde.  Ms. Rohde expressed her grateful appreciation to the Department of Justice Consumer Protection Branch, the FDA Office of the Chief Counsel and the Alabama Board of Pharmacy.“Injectable drugs prescribed for patients – especially vulnerable cancer patients – must be pure, sterile and produced in an FDA-compliant facility that is within the supply chain that FDA oversees,” stated Special Agent-in-Charge McCormack. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those manufacturers who would violate the public’s trust and endanger their health by attempting to avoid FDA’s oversight authority.”“Companies that sell oncology drugs from a facility not registered with the FDA threaten the health and safety of cancer patients,” stated HHS OIG Special Agent-in-Charge Lampert.  “We will continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners to protect patients from such shortcuts.”“The illegal misbranding and distribution of drugs threatens the health and safety of U.S. military members, retirees and their dependents,” stated DCIS Special Agent-in-Charge Barzey.  “Today’s guilty plea is demonstrative of DCIS’s ongoing commitment to work jointly with the USAO EDNY, FDA, HHS OIG and OPM-OIG, in order to protect members of the Armed Forces and to ensure the integrity of the Defense Department’s TRICARE healthcare system.”“OPM-OIG agents will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to protect Federal employees, annuitants and their families from companies that would put the health of vulnerable cancer patients at risk,” stated OPM-OIG Special Agent-in-Charge Rezendes.As set forth in court records, between 2001 and 2014, two of ABSG’s Alabama-based subsidiaries, Medical Initiatives Inc. (MII) and Oncology Supply Company (OSC), prepared millions of syringes that had been pre-filled with oncology supportive care drugs — specifically, Aloxi®, Anzemet®, generic versions of granisetron injection, Kytril®, Neupogen® and Procrit®.  Those syringes were shipped to oncology centers, medical practices and physicians for administration to immunocompromised cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment in all 50 states, including to approximately 37 healthcare providers located in the Eastern District of New York.To prepare pre-filled syringes (PFS), MII removed FDA-approved drug products from their original glass vials and repackaged them into plastic syringes through a process that allowed MII to access and sell excess drug product in the vials, known as “overfill,” that MII was able to extract from the vials.  As alleged in the Information, however, MII prepared PFS in an unclean, unsterile environment.   Accordingly, MII’s process for creating PFS resulted in some PFS that contained particles or foreign matter, which MII employees identified and termed “floaters.”  PFS were also at times not of the quality or purity that MII and OSC represented them to be to their customers.MII’s business model was to combine the contents of multiple vials in a process known as “pooling.”  However, as set forth in the Information, many of the vials used by MII to prepare PFS were designated by the drug manufacturer as “single use” vials, meaning that the manufacturer could not guarantee the sterility of the drug product if the vials were breached.  However, in the pooling process, MII’s technicians frequently breached drug vials multiple times, thereby increasing the risk of contamination.In order to avoid the FDA’s regulatory oversight, ABSG did not register MII as a re-packager or manufacturer with the FDA as required by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.  Instead, ABSG inaccurately portrayed MII to its customers and to state agencies as a state-regulated pharmacy in the business of dispensing drugs pursuant valid prescriptions and claimed that MII was otherwise in compliance with state pharmacy laws.  By holding MII out as a pharmacy, ABSG unlawfully exploited an exemption to the FDA registration requirement that is reserved for legitimate pharmacies, not for manufacturers or re-packagers.In connection with the guilty plea, ABSG filed a Statement of Facts setting forth those facts which it is admitting.As part of its guilty plea, ABSG has agreed to pay a $208 million criminal fine, plus $52 million in criminal forfeiture, for a total financial penalty of $260 million.  In addition, ABSG has entered into an agreement with the Office and the Department of Justice’s Consumer Protection Branch to maintain a compliance and ethics program designed to increase accountability of individuals and corporate board members, to increase transparency, and to strengthen ABSG’s compliance with the FDCA.  The compliance and ethics program requires corporate board members to review annually the effectiveness of the company’s compliance program and for ABSG to maintain a hotline that will receive and process complaints about any improper practices.The government’s case is being handled by the Office’s Business and Securities Fraud Section.  Assistant United States Attorneys Alixandra E. Smith and Ameet B. Kabrawala are in charge of the prosecution.  Senior Litigation Counsel Patrick Jasperse of the Department of Justice Consumer Protection Branch also provided assistance.Topic(s):Prescription DrugsComponent(s):USAO - New York, EasternContact:John Marzulli Tyler Daniels United States Attorney’s Office (718) 254-6323"

Ferrer, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and Justin D. Green, Special Agent in Charge, United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Criminal Investigations, Miami Field Office, made the announcement.Kerri L. Kaley, 50 of Cold Spring Harbor, New York, was sentenced in Miami on eight felony counts in a criminal case arising out of a Miami-based FDA investigation that has led to convictions in over twenty-five cases of medical device theft and has resulted in forfeitures, fines, and restitution totaling over $5 million.  U.S. District Court Judge Darrin P. Gayles presided over a trial of seven of Kaley’s charges of conviction in September, for her role in a conspiracy to transport and sell in interstate commerce various stolen prescription medical devices, the actual transport and sale of stolen medical devices, and money laundering associated with that activity.  In November 2014, Kaley was tried and convicted on charges of obstructing justice in connection with the same activity.  At sentencing, Kaley was ordered to serve a term of thirty-six months in prison, to be followed by a similar term of supervised release. In connection with the criminal trial, Kaley agreed to, and was ordered to forfeit $500,000 to the United States, with the possibility of a further money judgment to be resolved at a later ring.According to court records and testimony at trial, from approximately 1995 through February 2005, Kaley participated in a conspiracy with a group of individuals based in Long Island, New York. The entire group, including Kaley, were medical device sales representatives for subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson.  While based in Miami, Kaley solicited sales representatives and other employees of medical device manufacturers, seeking to purchase medical devices for re-sale. As part of the conspiracy, Kaley and others working with her would secure possession of significant quantities of prescription medical devices from hospitals they serviced for their employer, which were then forwarded to a conspirator in Delray Beach, Florida.  These devices were often state-of-the-art equipment used for minimally invasive surgeries and suture materials used by hospitals.  The devices were acquired by theft and fraud from customer medical facilities, New York non-profit hospitals. During the course of the illicit activity Kaley laundered over $2.2 million in payments through two sham construction corporations and used the funds to pay the co-conspirators, their home mortgages, home-renovations, and child care expenses.Charges remain pending against co-conspirator Brian K. Kaley, but no trial date has been set.  An indictment is merely an accusation and a defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.Mr. Ferrer commended the investigative efforts of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in this matter.  The current case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Thomas Watts-FitzGerald, Brooke Watson, and Alison Lehr.Related court documents and information may be found on the website of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida atwww.flsd.uscourts.govor onhttp://pacer.flsd.uscourts.govUSAO - Florida, SouthernTopic:Financial Fraud"

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseMay 26, 2017United States Department of JusticeNorthern District of GeorgiaATLANTA - Deanna Roberts has been sentenced to eleven years and three months in federal prison for illegally injecting persons with liquid silicone and for introducing liquid silicone that was obtained by fraud into interstate commerce. One woman died approximately 36 hours after Roberts performed the injection, after the silicone migrated to her lungs, heart, brain, and other organs. Other victims who received silicone injections by Roberts were hospitalized with respiratory problems when the silicone moved to their lungs. Even after Roberts became aware that the victim died and others had been hospitalized, Roberts continued to obtain silicone illegally so that she could administer silicone to others.“The defendant was aware that silicone injections she was administering were causing serious harm, even requiring hospitalization, yet she continued to inject paying customers with it knowing the risks that were involved,” said U. S. Attorney John Horn. “Even after Roberts knew that the victim in this case died from the injections she gave her, she did not stop. This case is a shocking reminder that citizens should seek care only from experienced and licensed health care professionals.”“The FDA has not approved any liquid silicone products to be injected into the body for tissue augmentation, and serious harm, including death, can occur following such injections,” said Justin D. Green, Special Agent in Charge, FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations’ Miami Field Office. “We will continue to aggressively pursue and bring to justice those who endanger the U.S. public health by offering this hazardous procedure.”According to U.S. Attorney Horn, the charges and other information presented in court: Liquid silicone is strictly regulated by the Food and Drug Administration and may be legally injected directly into the human body only as a treatment for certain eye conditions. In April 2004, Roberts began ordering liquid silicone from a business in Arizona. In order to purchase liquid silicone from the business, Roberts submitted an affidavit to the company in which she falsely swore that she did not intend to inject the silicone into humans. Rather, she claimed that she intended to supply the silicone to a customer for use in lubricating medical equipment. Between April 2004 and December 2015, Roberts purchased at least 178 gallons of liquid silicone.Roberts injected the silicone she illegally obtained into the hips, buttocks, and other body parts of her victims. Roberts falsely claimed to them that she was a licensed medical practitioner and that the silicone she used was medical grade. Roberts charged between $300 and $1000 for each silicone treatment that she administered.During the evening of November 16, 2015, Roberts injected liquid silicone into the buttocks of L.H. The next day L.H. complained of tightness in her chest and shortness of breath, symptoms that are consistent with the presence of liquid silicone in the lungs. During the early morning hours of November 18, 2015, L.H. died. Dr. Geoffrey Smith, Associate Medical Examiner for DeKalb County, performed an autopsy on L.H. Based upon the autopsy Dr. Smith determined that L.H. died from complications due to silicone polymer embolization. Dr. Smith found that L.H.’s lungs were heavily congested with liquid silicone.In addition, Dr. Smith found liquid silicone in L.H.’s liver, kidney, heart, brain, and spleen. Dr. Smith noted that each of L.H.’s buttocks had 10 injection sites. From a microscopic examination of tissue surrounding one of the injection sites, Dr. Smith determined that a blood vessel had been punctured. The evidence, therefore, established that the defendant punctured the blood vessel with one of the silicone injections and that the silicone was carried by the blood stream to L.H.’s lungs and other organs causing her death.Also on November 16, 2015, the defendant illegally injected liquid silicone into the buttocks of victim J.T. In November 2014, the defendant injected liquid silicone into the buttocks of victim V.M. and in October 2014, the defendant injected liquid silicone into the face of victim S.P. However, J.T., V.M., and S.P. did not die nor were they hospitalized from their injections.In 2006, Roberts administered silicone injections to victim J.H.’s lips on three occasions. Also in 2006, Roberts hired J.H. to drive her to Florida where she would administer silicone injections. J.H. worked for Roberts as a driver for about four months. J.H. testified that Roberts was aware that at least one person was hospitalized after Roberts injected her with silicone. J.H. also testified that Roberts claimed that the victim was hospitalized, not because she suffered complications from the silicone injections, but because she was HIV positive. However, J.H. was aware that the victim was not HIV positive.In 2006, Roberts injected victim S.W. with liquid silicone. Shortly thereafter, S.W. began to feel tightness in her chest and discomfort in her lungs. The next day she passed out at work. S.W. was taken to the hospital and spent the next 31 days there recovering from problems with her lungs. When she was released, S.W. had to use oxygen to assist her in breathing.In October 2009, Roberts administered silicone injections into victim A.S.’s buttocks at A.S.’s house in Florida. A.S. immediately felt her heart rate accelerate, so she asked Roberts to stop. Roberts then took A.S. to the emergency room. A.S. was admitted to the hospital with respiratory problems and the next day she was placed on a ventilator. A.S. stayed in the hospital 2-3 weeks. While A.S. was in the hospital, Roberts called her to check on her condition. At the same time, Roberts inquired about when she could come by to pick up the payment that A.S. owed her for the silicone injections. While A.S. was still hospitalized, Roberts came to the hospital to pick up a check to pay for the injections. During the visit, A.S. overheard a nurse tell Roberts that A.S. was being treated for silicone poisoning. Since 2013, A.S. has had problems because the silicone that Roberts injected into her buttocks has been coming out of her body. Because of this, A.S. spent another eight weeks in the hospital and has had surgery in an attempt to remove the silicone. As a result, her buttocks are now deformed.Roberts administered silicone injections to victim D.R., on multiple occasions between 2005 and 2010. In June 2010, Roberts administered silicone injections to D.R.’s breasts and face at the defendant’s house in Florida. Later that day D.R. began to feel nauseous. The following day she went to the emergency room and was admitted to the hospital for treatment for acute respiratory failure. She had to be resuscitated and was placed on a respirator. After spending a month in the hospital, D.R. was released to a rehabilitation facility where she spent several weeks before she could return to her home.D.R.’s friend, K.M. was present the day the defendant administered the silicone injections that hospitalized her. After D.R. was hospitalized, K.M. informed the defendant that D.R. was in the hospital.Deanna Roberts, 47, of Sanford, Florida, was sentenced to eleven years and three months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release. Roberts was convicted on these charges on March 31, 2017, after she pleaded guilty.This case was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, the Doraville Police Department, and the Atlanta Police Department.Assistant U.S. Attorneys William L. McKinnon, Jr. and Erin E. Sanders prosecuted the case.For further information please contact the U.S. Attorney’s Public Affairs Office atUSAGAN.PressEmails@usdoj.gov (link sends e-mail)or (404) 581-6016.

Vaccination Services also pleaded guilty today to the same federal charges.The misbranded drugs – meaning they were sold without a valid prescription from a veterinarian – were Comfortis, an anti-flea medication, and Ciprofloxacin, a powerful antibiotic commonly called “Cipro” that can be used in dogs and cats to treat skin, respiratory and urinary tract infections.According to court documents, Gerson sold Comfortis that was designed for the South African market and was not approved for distribution in the United States. Federal law prohibits the importation and sale of veterinary medicines that have not been approved by the FDA and Environmental Protection Agency for use in this country.Gerson used several websites – including fleastuff.com, mydoghasfleas.xyz and fleaandtickstuff.com – to market prescription animal products to buyers without valid prescriptions.In a plea agreement filed in United States District Court, Gerson admitted that he “knowingly distributed, transported and sold the prescription animal drugs Comfortis and Ciprofloxacin in interstate commerce” to an undercover law enforcement officer in Missouri in August 2016. Gerson at the time knew that the drug had been smuggled into the United States “because the drugs were foreign-market branded and not approved by the U.S. FDA for entry into the United States.”Gerson also admitted that he sold foreign market pesticides – animal flea and tick products not approved for sale and distribution in the United States – to an undercover law enforcement officer in Washington in June 2012.Gerson pleaded guilty today before United States District Judge R. Gary Klausner, who is scheduled to sentence Gerson and his company on December 11.In the plea agreement, prosecutors and Gerson have agreed that the appropriate sentence in this case is 30 months in federal prison and a fine of $200,000. The final sentence will be determined by Judge Klausner, and if the judge decides to deviate from the agreed-upon sentence both parties have the right to withdraw from the plea agreement and proceed to trial.In addition to the prison sentence and criminal fine, Gerson has agreed to the entry of a $2.5 million forfeiture judgment which will require Gerson to forfeit the proceeds of his long-running scheme.In its plea agreement, Vaccination Services has agreed to pay a $300,000 fine and to be placed on probation for a period of five years. This stipulated sentence is also subject to the approval of Judge Klausner.Gerson was previously convicted of charges related to the illegal sale of pet medications and products. According to documents previously filed in the federal case in Los Angeles, Gerson pleaded guilty in Texas in 2014 to state charges of delivery of a dangerous drug, specifically a prescription drug called Clenbuterol.In a related case, Judge Klausner in June ordered a South African veterinarian to pay a fine of $5,000 and forfeit to the United States $145,000 after pleading guilty to a charge of making false statements in relation to unapproved pet medications he shipped to Gerson. Craig Mostert sent the foreign-market drugs to Gerson, and significantly understated the value of the products in a series of shipments between 2008 and 2017.The case against Gerson and Vaccination Services is the product of an investigation by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations, the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, and the Environmental Protection Agency.This case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Joseph O. Johns, Chief of the Environmental and Community Safety Crimes Section.Component(s):USAO - California, CentralContact:Thom Mrozek Spokesperson/Public Affairs Officer United States Attorney’s Office Central District of California (Los Angeles) 213-894-6947Press Release Number:17-159"

Leo Glasser to six months’ home confinement, four years’ probation, and 300 hours of community service, for wire fraud conspiracy in connection with their operation of Med Prep Consulting, Inc. (Med Prep), a now-defunct Tinton Falls, New Jersey-based medical drug repackager and compounding pharmacy, which sold adulterated and contaminated drug products to healthcare providers across the country. As part of their sentences, Kalinoski will forfeit $140,000 of criminal proceeds to the government. The amount of forfeiture owed by Tighe and the amount of restitution both defendants must pay to Yale-New Haven Hospital, which discovered it had received drug products from Med Prep contaminated with mold, will be determined by the Court at a later date. The defendants pleaded guilty to the charges on July 14, 2017.Bridget M. Rohde, Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and Mark McCormack, Special Agent-in-Charge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, Metropolitan Washington Field Office (FDA OCI), announced the sentence.“Gerald Tighe and Stephen Kalinoski, motivated by a desire to increase profits and cut costs, put patients already suffering from serious illnesses at further risk by distributing drugs that were contaminated or mislabeled,” stated Acting United States Attorney Rohde. “We will continue to investigate and prosecute those drug repackagers and compounding pharmacies that would place corporate greed ahead of patient safety.”  Ms. Rohde gratefully acknowledged the assistance and cooperation of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations; the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General, Office of Investigations; the United States Office of Personnel Management, Office of the Inspector General; the Department of Justice, Civil Division, Consumer Protection Branch and Commercial Litigation Branch; the FDA’s Office of the Chief Counsel; the Office of the Attorney General of New Jersey; and the New Jersey Board of Pharmacy.“When people place profits over the public health and distribute unsafe and contaminated drugs, it is the U.S. consumer who is put at risk,” stated FDA OCI Special Agent-in-Charge McCormack. “The FDA will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who endanger the public’s health by distributing adulterated drugs.”The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Alixandra E.

McKinley, to four felony charges including distributing Tramadol, a Schedule IV controlled substance, introduction of misbranded drugs, and wire fraud, announced United States Attorney Russell M. Coleman.According to the plea agreement, Skyler Dean Prahl, 32, imported Tramadol powder from overseas and used an encapsulating machine to create Tramadol capsules.  Tramadol is a synthetic opioid drug. For several years Prahl operated an online business marketing and selling Tramadol capsules and other substances to customers throughout the United States.  Prahl sold well over 80,000 units of Tramadol to customers without inquiring or verifying that his customers had a valid prescription.Prahl admitted that on August 31, 2015, he knowingly and intentionally possessed with the intent to distribute, and distributed Tramadol to an undercover agent.He further admitted that on August 31, 2015, with the intent to mislead and defraud, he introduced a misbranded drug, Tramadol, into interstate commerce by shipping Tramadol from Champaign, Illinois, to Owensboro, Kentucky.  The Tramadol was misbranded because its label failed to state the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, and distributor., and because it failed to bear adequate directions for use.Lastly, Prahl admitted that between January 28, 2016, and March 5, 2016, he devised a wire fraud scheme. Specifically, Prahl used email to promise to deliver at least 3,000 Tramadol capsules to “Michael Riley” in return for $950, but failed to deliver the Tramadol capsules even after receiving the funds.If convicted at trial, Prahl could have been sentenced to no more than 31 years in prison, fined, and order to serve a period of supervised release.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseNovember 22, 2017United States Department of JusticeThe former compliance director of an Indiana compounding pharmacy pleaded guilty to introducing adulterated drugs into interstate commerce and conspiracy to defraud the United States by obstructing the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) lawful functions, the Department of Justice announced today.Caprice R. Bearden, 63, of Carmel, Indiana, pleaded guilty in the Southern District of Indiana to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, three misdemeanor counts of introducing an adulterated drug in interstate commerce, and six misdemeanor counts of adulterating drugs while held for sale after shipment of a drug component in interstate commerce.  Bearden was the Director of Compliance for Pharmakon Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Pharmakon).  Pharmakon compounded drugs at a facility in Noblesville, Indiana, for customers in various states.Chief U.S. District Judge Jane E. Magnus-Stinson accepted Bearden’s plea. A date for sentencing has not been sent yet.\"This guilty plea demonstrates the Justice Department’s commitment to protecting patients and ensuring that compounded drugs are safe,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Chad A. Readler of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.  “Distributing out-of-specification drug products poses a serious risk of harm to patients.  The Justice Department will not tolerate efforts to impede FDA’s ability to uncover these types of safety concerns.”“This defendant distributed serious drugs to hospitals in Indiana and around the country, knowing that the drugs were significantly under or over the strength they were supposed to be,” said Josh Minkler, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana.  “She put greed and the reputation of her company ahead of the health and safety of our most vulnerable patient populations.”As part of her plea agreement, Bearden acknowledged that during 2014 and 2016 FDA inspections, she lied about Pharmakon’s never having received any out-of-specification drug potency test results.   Bearden also acknowledged that she knowingly conspired with another individual to defraud the United States by obstructing the lawful functions of the FDA.  In addition, she acknowledged that it was the purpose of the conspiracy to prevent the loss of revenue that would result from customers’ and FDA’s knowledge of Pharmakon’s having distributed numerous compounded drugs that were not the strength purported on the drugs’ labeling.“This is an egregious example of how harmful conduct can result in risk to patients. The disregard for the law resulted in the injury of infants from poorly compounded, super potent morphine products,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “We will not tolerate substandard practices, like failing to meet federal manufacturing standards like those found at Pharmakon, that put patients at risk and will aggressively pursue individuals that put profit ahead of patient safety.”The conspiracy charge to which Bearden pleaded guilty carries a statutory maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or gross loss from the offense.  The misdemeanor charges of distributing an adulterated drug in interstate commerce and adulterating drugs while held for sale after shipment of a drug component in interstate commerce each carry a statutory maximum punishment of one year in prison and a fine of $100,000 or twice the gross gain or gross loss from the offense.Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Readler and U.S. Attorney Minkler commended the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, which conducted the investigation.  Trial Attorney David A. Frank of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorney Cindy J.

Morrison of the Food and Drug Administration - Office of Criminal Investigations’ Kansas City Field Office. Elias Trevino Jr. pleaded guilty May 15, 2017.Today, Senior U.S. District Judge John D. Rainey handed Trevino a 12-month term of imprisonment. In handing down the sentence, Judge Rainey noted that FDA regulations are in place to protect the public which Trevino repeatedly violated. “The is egregious conduct that I can’t ignore” he said. Trevino will also be required to serve three years of supervised release following completion of the prison term.“Drugs labeled as natural dietary supplements that contain undeclared, dangerous ingredients present a serious risk to consumers’ health,” said Morrison. “We will continue to pursue and bring to justice criminals who endanger the public by offering and distributing such falsely labeled and dangerous drugs.”Trevino was one of the owners of X2Zero, a store selling dietary supplements online and through stores located in Corpus Christi. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined a number of products sold there as “herbal weight loss supplements” were found to contain misbranded or unapproved foreign drugs.In 1997, the (FDA) approved a prescription drug containing sibutramine under the trade name Meridia for the management of obesity. In October 2010, the FDA requested the Meridia marketer to withdraw the drug from the United States market due to the health risks associated with sibutramine, including an increased risk of heart attack, stroke and death. On Dec. 21, 2010, at the request of the manufacturer, the FDA withdrew its approval of Meridia. Since that time, no drug containing sibutramine has been approved for human use in the United States.At the time of his guilty plea, Trevino admitted he knowingly possessed and sold diet drugs containing sibutramine. He acknowledged he imported the drugs from China and sold them through both the X2Zero store in Corpus Christi and on the Internet in violation of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.Previously released on bond, Trevino was taken into custody following the sentencing today where he will remain pending transfer to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future.The FDA - Office of Criminal Investigations conducted the investigation.

United States District Judge Donald E. Walter presided over the trial. The defendants’ trial started October 30 and ended on Monday, November 7, 2017 with the jury returning the guilty verdict after deliberating for three and a half hours.Evidence admitted at trial revealed that from November 11, 2010 to December 2012 Hebert, Kohll’s Pharmacy & Healthcare Inc. of Omaha, Neb., which operated as Essential Pharmacy Compounding, and others conspired to distribute a synthetic form of the drug Dermorphin, which was then given to racehorses to improve their racing performance.  Essential Pharmacy Compounding repackaged a synthetic form of the drug that it obtained from a California chemical company, labeled it as D-Peptide, and sold it to Hebert and other veterinarians.  Hebert then put the drug into syringes and gave the loaded syringes to the racetrack trainers tasked with the horses’ care.  Evidence at trial revealed that Demorphin is a strong painkiller that masks horses’ pain and any pre-existing injuries.  Depending on dosage, it can also act as a stimulant when injected in horses. The Food and Drug Administration has not approved the drug for use in humans or animals.“This office is committed to vigorous prosecution of unlawful practices by pharmacies and/or distributors of harmful drugs that put humans or animals at risk,” Van Hook stated. “We are pleased with this verdict.”“FDA is responsible for protecting not only human consumers, but also animals, including race horses, from unscrupulous distributors of illegal drugs,” said Justin D.

The PBSO PBNTF suspected the overdose death of decedent as having resulted from counterfeit oxycodone pills which were found in decedent’s possession following her overdose. Forensic analysis of those pills determined they had been illicitly manufactured as copies of oxycodone pills -- using FUF, an extremely powerful synthetic opioid many times more powerful than street level heroin or oxycodone – as the active ingredient.Toxicology analysis conducted by the Office of the District Medical Examiner of Palm Beach County attributed the cause of decedent’s death to the fentanyl analog FUF in its autopsy report. Ultimately, an extensive investigation led to Dr. Benjamin as the source of the FUF pills responsible for decedent’s death. Investigators also uncovered a distribution network implicating Dr. Benjamin in the manufacture and distribution of counterfeit oxycodone pills outside the South Florida area.If convicted, Dr. Benjamin faces a mandatory minimum of 20 years’ imprisonment to a maximum life term of imprisonment for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance (resulting in death) and distribution of a controlled substance (resulting in death); and, a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment for attempted possession with intent to distribute controlled substances.This case is the result of the ongoing efforts by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) a partnership that brings together the combined expertise and unique abilities of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. The principal mission of the OCDETF program is to identify, disrupt, dismantle and prosecute high level members of drug trafficking, weapons trafficking and money laundering organizations and enterprises.Mr. Greenberg commended the investigative efforts of DEA, ATF, FDA-OCI, PBSO, Indian River County Sheriff’s Office, and Orlando Melbourne Airport Police Department.

It is alleged that often times the pills were distributed to others in return for cash payments.Acting United States Attorney Stephen G. Dambruch and Jeffrey Ebersole Resident Agent in Charge, Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI) announced the filing of criminal complaints charging Robert Rose, 51, David Rose, 58, and Tammy Bonham, 53, of Providence, Victoria Coccia-Rose, 28, of Pawtucket, and Michael Slonski, 47 of Johnston, with conspiracy to unlawfully acquire or obtain possession of a controlled substance by fraud, to distribute a controlled substance, to commit healthcare fraud and to commit aggravated identity theft.Acting United States Attorney Stephen G. Dambruch said, “Earlier this week this office announced the arrest of more than two-dozen people who allegedly contributed to the addiction epidemic that is sweeping through Rhode Island by allegedly distributing hundreds of kilograms of fentanyl and cocaine. The arrests announced today highlight yet another scheme to profit from the addiction epidemic. Law enforcement on every level will continue to work together to identify, investigate, arrest and prosecute these traffickers and schemers.”“Opioid addiction and the resulting overdoses and deaths are an enormous national crisis,” said Jeffrey J. Ebersole, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ New York Field Office. “Our office will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who distribute illegally obtained opioids from outside the legitimate supply chain and make them available to U.S. consumers.”According to court documents, it is alleged that an investigation by members of the Rhode Island FDA-OIC task force determined that participants of the scheme manufactured fraudulent prescriptions utilizing the identities, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) identification numbers and signatures of medical practitioners without their consent. Prescriptions for varying amounts of oxycodone pills were written and presented to pharmacies by some members of the conspiracy and others working at the direction of the conspirators. It is alleged that the scheme often times included the fraudulent use of medical insurance to pay pharmacies for the illicit prescriptions. Most of the oxycodone pills gained with the use of fraudulent prescriptions were sold to others for distribution.According to court documents, it is alleged that as part of the scheme, the alleged leader of the conspiracy, Robert Rose, paid for individuals’ identities, health care insurance information, and for various prescribing medical practitioners’ names and DEA numbers. Rose provided that information to another member of the conspiracy, along with special paper necessary to produce the fraudulent prescriptions. At times, it is alleged, Robert Rose ran the conspiracy while incarcerated at the Adult Correctional Institution.Robert Rose made an initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Providence on Thursday and was released on unsecured bond. David Rose, Tammy Bonham and Michael Slonski made initial appearances in U.S. District Court on October 17, 2017, and were released on unsecured bond. Victoria Coccia-Rose made an initial appearance in U.S. District Court on October 18, 2017, and was released on unsecured bond.A criminal complaint is merely an allegation and is not evidence of guilt. A defendant is entitled to a fair trial in which it will be the government’s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Dulce Donovan.The matter was investigated by the Rhode Island Food and Drug Administration-Office of Criminal Investigations task force, with the assistance of Social Security Administration, Office of Inspector General.The Rhode Island Food and Drug Administration-Office of Criminal Investigations task force consists of investigators from FDA-OCI, Rhode Island State Police, East Providence Police, North Providence Police, Westerly Police, Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Postal Inspection Service and Homeland Security Investigations.Additionally, Acting United States Attorney Stephen G.

The indictment against Geo Medical and Hwasung Pak, the company’s president and CEO, alleges they sent to the United States shipments of contact lenses with values ranging from $6,200 to $71,815, but declared all five shipments to be worth less than $200. This undervaluing allegedly allowed them to avoid import duties, as well as inspection and seizure by the FDA.In 2013, Geo Medical was placed on an FDA “Red List” that restricted imports of its products after samples of its contact lenses were found to be contaminated with microorganisms. The import alert authorized the FDA to automatically detain any Geo Medical contact lenses coming into the United States.In two other cases filed on October 27, two corporations that operate retail outlets in Los Angeles and Orange counties were charged with selling “misbranded” contact lenses without the necessary prescriptions. The criminal informations filed by prosecutors charge I-Takashima, Inc. and TS Group, Inc., which operate cosmetics and gift stores under the Takashima name in Irvine and Rowland Heights, respectively. The decorative contact lenses allegedly illegally sold by Takashima were marketed as Halloween and beauty accessories under the brand name Deja-vu and were manufactured by Geo Medical.Contact lenses – whether corrective, cosmetic or decorative – are prescription medical devices subject to United States Food and Drug Administration regulations. Due to the risk of injury, blindness and possible eye infection, all contact lenses require prescriptions from medical professionals who can provide guidance on the proper care and maintenance of the contact lenses.The FDA regularlyissues warningsconcerning the use of decorative contact lenses, which have become popular during the Halloween season. The American Academy of Ophthalmology also cautions against the use ofdecorative contact(link is external)lenses andlos lentes de contacto de color(link is external).Indictments and criminal informations contain allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty in court.Geo Medical and Pak are charged with five felony offenses, each of which carries a statutory maximum penalty of two years in federal prison for the CEO and fines of up to $500,000 for the corporation.I-Takashima and TS Group are each charged with one misdemeanor count of selling misbranded devices. This charge carries a maximum fine of $200,000 for the corporations.I-Takashima has been summoned to appear for an arraignment in United States District Court in Santa Ana on November 27. TS Group, Geo Medical and Pak have been summoned to appear for arraignments in federal court in Los Angeles on November 30.The ongoing investigation into the illegal importation and sale of contact lenses is being conducted by the FDA’s Office of Criminal InvestigationsThe three cases announced today are being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Diana M. Kwok of the General Crimes Section.Component(s):USAO - California, CentralPress Release Number:17-196"

Stretch; Drug Enforcement Administration Special Agent in Charge John J. Martin; Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation, Special Agent in Charge Michael T. Batdorf; and U.S. Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations Special Agent in Charge Lisa L. Malinowski.  The Honorable Jeffrey S. White, U.S. District Judge, accepted the plea.According to the guilty plea, King, 27, of Oakland, Calif., admitted that from October 6, 2014 through December 12, 2015, he was involved in a conspiracy with his co-defendant David Beckford and others to manufacture and distribute pills that were designed to resemble Xanax® pills as nearly as possible.  King admitted that he knew his co-defendants and others obtained the components and equipment to manufacture the counterfeit Xanax pills from foreign sources.  King further admitted that from October 6, 2014, through December 12, 2015, he sold counterfeit Xanax pills that were created as part of the operation.On May 12, 2016, a federal grand jury returned a 33-count indictment charging King and four co-defendants, David Beckford, Stephan Florida, Isaiah Clayton, and Beau Sankene, with numerous crimes related to the conspiracy.  For his role, King was charged with one count of conspiracy to manufacture, distribute, and possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846; one count of conspiracy to commit international money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h); four counts of international money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(2)(A); and one count of trafficking in a counterfeit drug, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2320(a)(4).  Pursuant to today’s plea agreement, King pleaded guilty to violating one count each of 21 U.S.C. § 846, 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h), and 18 U.S.C. § 2320(a)(4).  The maximum statutory sentence for a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846 is 5 years, the maximum statutory sentence for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) is 20 years, and the maximum statutory sentence for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2320(a)(4) is 10 years.  However, any sentence following conviction will be imposed by the court only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. § 3553.On February 9, 2017, Judge White sentenced David Beckford, 28, of Oakland, Calif., to serve 123 months in prison to be followed by a three-year period of supervised release for his role in the scheme.  Judge White also ordered forfeiture of currency, firearms, ammunition, and custom jewelry.  Co-defendants Stephan Florida, 27, of San Francisco, Calif., and Isaiah Clayton, 24, of Oakland, Calif., were sentenced to 14 months’ imprisonment and 36 months’ probation, respectively, for their roles in the scheme.  Beau Sankene of Oakland, Calif., has pleaded guilty to crimes related to her roles in the conspiracy.  A date for Sankene’s sentencing has not yet been scheduled.Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sheila Armbrust and Marc Wolf are prosecuting the case with the assistance of Ana Guerra and Yanira Osorio.  The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration, Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations.Topic(s):Drug TraffickingComponent(s):USAO - California, Northern"

Kapoor, 74, of Phoenix, Ariz., a current member of the Board of Directors of Insys, was arrested this morning in Arizona and charged with RICO conspiracy, as well as other felonies, including conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and conspiracy to violate the Anti-Kickback Law. Kapoor, the former Executive Chairman of the Board and CEO of Insys, will appear in federal court in Phoenix today.  He will appear in U.S. District Court in Boston at a later date.The superseding indictment, unsealed today in Boston, also includes additional allegations against several former Insys executives and managers who were initially indicted in December 2016.The superseding indictment charges that Kapoor; Michael L. Babich, 40, of Scottsdale, Ariz., former CEO and President of the company; Alec Burlakoff, 42, of Charlotte, N.C., former Vice President of Sales; Richard M. Simon, 46, of Seal Beach, Calif., former National Director of Sales; former Regional Sales Directors Sunrise Lee, 36, of Bryant City, Mich., and Joseph A. Rowan, 43, of Panama City, Fla.; and former Vice President of Managed Markets, Michael J. Gurry, 53, of Scottsdale, Ariz., conspired to bribe practitioners in various states, many of whom operated pain clinics, in order to get them to prescribe a fentanyl-based pain medication.  The medication, called “Subsys,” is a powerful narcotic intended to treat cancer patients suffering intense breakthrough pain.  In exchange for bribes and kickbacks, the practitioners wrote large numbers of prescriptions for the patients, most of whom were not diagnosed with cancer.The indictment also alleges that Kapoor and the six former executives conspired to mislead and defraud health insurance providers who were reluctant to approve payment for the drug when it was prescribed for non-cancer patients.  They achieved this goal by setting up the “reimbursement unit,” which was dedicated to obtaining prior authorization directly from insurers and pharmacy benefit managers.“In the midst of a nationwide opioid epidemic that has reached crisis proportions, Mr. Kapoor and his company stand accused of bribing doctors to overprescribe a potent opioid and committing fraud on insurance companies solely for profit,” said Acting United States Attorney William D. Weinreb. “Today's arrest and charges reflect our ongoing efforts to attack the opioid crisis from all angles. We must hold the industry and its leadership accountable - just as we would the cartels or a street-level drug dealer.”“As alleged, these executives created a corporate culture at Insys that utilized deception and bribery as an acceptable business practice, deceiving patients, and conspiring with doctors and insurers,” said Harold H. Shaw, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Field Division. “The allegations of selling a highly addictive opioid cancer pain drug to patients who did not have cancer, make them no better than street-level drug dealers. Today's charges mark an important step in holding pharmaceutical executives responsible for their part in the opioid crisis.   The FBI will vigorously investigate corrupt organizations with business practices that promote fraud with a total disregard for patient safety.”“These Insys executives allegedly fueled the opioid epidemic by paying doctors to needlessly prescribe an extremely dangerous and addictive form of fentanyl,” said Phillip Coyne, Special Agent in Charge for the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  “Corporate executives intent on illegally driving up profits need to be aware they are now squarely in the sights of law enforcement.”“As alleged, Insys executives improperly influenced health care providers to prescribe a powerful opioid for patients who did not need it, and without complying with FDA requirements, thus putting patients at risk and contributing to the current opioid crisis,” said Mark A. McCormack, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Field Office. “Our office will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to pursue and bring to justice those who threaten the public health.”“Pharmaceutical companies whose products include controlled medications that can lead to addiction and overdose have a special obligation to operate in a trustworthy, transparent manner, because their customers’ health and safety and, indeed, very lives depend on it,” said DEA Special Agent in Charge Michael J. Ferguson.  “DEA pledges to work with our law enforcement and regulatory partners nationwide to ensure that rules and regulations under the Controlled Substances Act are followed.”“Today’s arrest is the result of a joint effort to identify, investigate and prosecute individuals who engage in fraudulent activity and endanger patient health,” stated Special Agent in Charge Leigh-Alistair Barzey, Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) Northeast Field Office.  “DCIS will continue to work with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, District of Massachusetts, and our law enforcement partners, to protect U.S. military members, retirees and their dependents and the integrity of TRICARE, the Defense Department’s healthcare system.”“As alleged, John Kapoor and other top executives committed fraud, placing profit before patient safety, to sell a highly potent and addictive opioid.  EBSA will take every opportunity to work collaboratively with our law enforcement partners in these important investigations to protect participants in private sector health plans and contribute in fighting the opioid epidemic,” said Susan A. Hensley, Regional Director of the U.S. Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security Administration, Boston Regional Office.“Once again, the United States Postal Inspection Service is fully committed to protecting our nation’s mail system from criminal misuse,” said Shelly Binkowski, Inspector in Charge of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. “We are proud to work alongside our law enforcement partners to dismantle high level prescription drug practices which directly contribute to the opioid abuse epidemic.  This investigation highlights our commitment to defending our mail system from illegal misuse and ensuring public trust in the mail.”\"We are gratified to have contributed to this investigation and applaud the exceptional work of this investigative team for both protecting patient safety and program costs,\" said Eileen Neff, Special Agent in Charge  of the U.S. Postal Service, Office of Inspector General, Northeast Area Field Office. \"Along with our law enforcement partners, the USPSOIG will continue to aggressively investigate those who engage in fraudulent activities intended to defraud federal benefit programs and the Postal Service.\"“The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Inspector General will continue to aggressively investigate those that attempt to fraudulently impact programs designed to benefit our veterans and their families,” said Donna L. Neves, Special Agent in Charge of the VA OIG Northeast Field Office.The charges of conspiracy to commit RICO and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud each provide for a sentence of no greater than 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000, or twice the amount of pecuniary gain or loss.  The charges of conspiracy to violate the Anti-Kickback Law provide for a sentence of no greater than five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a $25,000 fine. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.The investigation was conducted by a team that included the FBI; HHS-OIG; FDA Office of Criminal Investigations; the Defense Criminal Investigative Service; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security Administration; the Office of Personnel Management; the U.S. Postal Inspection Service; the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General; and the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office would like to acknowledge the cooperation and assistance of the U.S. Attorney’s Offices around the country engaged in parallel investigations, including the District of Connecticut, Eastern District of Michigan, Southern District of Alabama, Southern District of New York, District of Rhode Island, and the District of New Hampshire.  The efforts of the Central District of California and the Justice Department’s Civil Fraud Section of the Department of Justice are also greatly appreciated.Assistant U.S. Attorneys K.

The charges relate to alleged sales of stimulants intended for inclusion in dietary supplements.The indictments charge the defendants with participation in a scheme to produce and sell dietary supplements containing hidden synthetic stimulants, such as 2-amino-6-methylheptane (“DMHA”). The charges also involve alleged shipments of 1,3-dimethylamylamine (“DMAA”) and DMHA. DMAA, which is chemically similar to DMHA, has been linked to severe adverse events such as heart attacks and strokes.The indictments allege that the defendants knew major American dietary supplement retailers would not carry supplements containing these stimulant ingredients. The indictments also allege the defendants agreed with a confidential government informant to either mislabel ingredients or otherwise help to hide the true nature of a proposed dietary supplement from retailers. None of the ingredients allegedly shipped during the undercover investigation were sold to consumers.“It is unlawful for companies both outside and inside the United States to conceal questionable, dangerous, or illegal ingredients in dietary supplements sold to American consumers,” said Chad A. Readler, Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. “These cases demonstrate the Department of Justice’s commitment to ensuring that dietary supplements are safe and accurately labeled.”“U.S. consumers trust that their dietary supplements are safe and contain appropriate labeling. When unscrupulous producers add undeclared or misidentified ingredients to dietary supplements, there is no assurance that the product is safe for consumption,” said Catherine A. Hermsen, Acting Director, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations. “The FDA will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who participate in fraudulently marketing dietary supplements to the detriment of public health.”The first indictment charges Genabolix USA Inc., a Nevada corporation; Shanghai Yongyi Bioltechnology Ltd., a Chinese corporation; Hu Chang Chun (a.k.a. James Hu), 44, of Shanghai, China, the principal of Genabolix; Gao Mei Fang (a.k.a. Amy Gao), 41, of Shanghai, China, the supply chain manager for Genabolix; and Zhang Xiao Dong (a.k.a. Mark Zhang), 31, of Shanghai, China, the sales manager for Genabolix, with mail fraud. The indictment also charges Genabolix, Shanghai Yongyi, Hu, and Gao with introducing misbranded food into interstate commerce. In addition, the indictment charges Genabolix, Yongyi, and Gao with obstruction of an agency proceeding and smuggling.A second indictment charges Shanghai Waseta International Trade Co. Ltd., a Chinese corporation; Max Pharmatech Inc., a California corporation; Xu Jia Bao (a.k.a. Fred Xu), 48, of Shanghai, China, the principal of Shanghai Waseta; and Li Ting Ting (a.k.a. Sunny Lee), 37, of Shanghai, China, the overseas sales manager for Shanghai Waseta, with wire fraud and with introducing misbranded food into interstate commerce. The indictment also charges Shanghai Waseta with smuggling.Gao Mei Fang, Zhang Xiao Dong, and Xu Jia Bao were arrested in late September at a dietary supplement trade show in Las Vegas and remain in custody. A date for trial before the federal district court in Dallas has not yet been set. The remaining individual defendants are not believed to be in the United States.“Few things are more important than ensuring the safety of what we put into our bodies,” said U.S. Attorney John Parker for the Northern District of Texas.  “Those who deliberately mislead us on this critical issue will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of our laws.”An indictment is an accusation by a federal grand jury and is not evidence of guilt. The defendants should be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.Upon conviction, the maximum statutory penalties for the individual defendants are 20 years’ imprisonment and a $250,000 fine for mail fraud or wire fraud; one year imprisonment and a $100,000 fine for the introduction of misbranded food into interstate commerce; three years’ imprisonment and a $250,000 fine for the introduction of misbranded food into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud or mislead; five years’ imprisonment and a $250,000 fine for obstruction of an agency proceeding; and 20 years’ imprisonment and a $250,000 fine for smuggling.The FDA Office of Criminal Investigations-Dallas Division investigated the case.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseOctober 25, 2017United States Department of JusticeDistrict of MassachusettsOutbreak was the largest public health crisis ever caused by a pharmaceutical productBOSTON – Glenn Chin, the supervisory pharmacist of New England Compounding Center (NECC) was convicted today by a federal jury of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud, and false labeling in connection with the 2012 nationwide fungal meningitis outbreak.After a five-week trial, the jury convicted Glenn Chin, 49, of Canton, Mass., of  racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud and mislead. U.S. District Court Judge Richard G. Stearns scheduled sentencing for Jan. 30, 2018.“Mr. Chin ran NECC’s clean room operations with depraved disregard for human lives,” said Acting U.S. Attorney William D. Weinreb. “As a licensed pharmacist, Mr. Chin took an oath to protect patients, but instead deliberately violated safety regulations, causing the largest public health crisis caused by a pharmaceutical drug in U.S. history. Time and time again, Mr. Chin made dangerous decisions: he decided to cut corners, to improperly sterilize and test drugs, to mislabel drugs, to skip cleanings and ignore contamination in the clean rooms, and to endanger patients’ lives. Now, the jury has found that Mr. Chin must be held accountable for the consequences of his decisions. I want to express my profound gratitude to the victims and survivors for supporting the five-year investigation and prosecution of this case. I also want to acknowledge the tireless commitment of the trial team, whose perseverance has brought us one step closer to a just conclusion.”“We’ve seen the tragic impact poorly compounded drugs can have on patients. Above all else, we must continue to make protecting the public health a top priority by doing all we can to ensure that the compounded drugs that patients rely on are of high quality,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “No patient should suffer harm or be put at risk because of poorly compounded drugs. The FDA will continue to prioritize implementing the Drug Quality and Security Act in a way that encourages compounders to adhere to new safeguards, and the agency will take aggressive action against those who put patients at risk by violating the law.”“Today’s verdict holds Glenn Chin responsible for his role in one of the largest public health crises in this country’s history. Mr. Chin gambled with patients’ lives by cutting corners and ignoring the warning signs that his production methods were unsafe. Hundreds of patients were unnecessarily harmed from his reckless disregard for health and safety regulations,” said Harold H. Shaw, Special Agent in Charge, FBI Boston Division. “We’ll continue to keep the victims and families of this deadly outbreak in our prayers, and the FBI, along with our law enforcement partners, will do everything in our power to combat fraudulent and abusive health care practices.”In 2012, 753 patients in 20 states were diagnosed with a fungal infection after receiving injections of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) manufactured by NECC.  Of those 753 patients, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 64 patients in nine states died.Chin manufactured the three lots of the contaminated MPA, which comprised more than 17,000 vials of medication. In doing so, Chin ignored NECC’s own drug formulation worksheets and standard operating procedures. Specifically, he sterilized the MPA substantially less than what the recipe required and failed to validate or verify the sterilization process at all.  Despite knowing these deficiencies, Chin directed the MPA to be filled into thousands of vials and shipped to NECC customers nationwide. Further, as the supervising pharmacist who oversaw all of NECC’s drug compounding operations, Chin directed the shipping of drugs prior to receiving test results confirming their sterility and directed pharmacy technicians to mislabel drugs to conceal this practice.  He also directed the compounding of drugs with expired ingredients, including chemotherapy drugs that had expired several years prior. Chin prioritized drug production over cleaning, directed the forging of cleaning logs, and routinely ignored mold and bacteria found inside the clean rooms. Lastly, for more than three years, Chin, along with co-conspirators, utilized a pharmacy technician whose license had been revoked by the Massachusetts Board of Pharmacy to compound highly sensitive cardiac drug solutions, and took steps to conceal the technician’s presence inside the clean room from state regulators.“The health and safety of U.S. military members, retirees and their dependents is a top priority for the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS),” stated Special Agent-in-Charge Leigh-Alistair Barzey, DCIS Northeast Field Office.  “Today’s verdict demonstrates DCIS’ ongoing commitment to work with the USAO-MA and its law enforcement partners to identify, investigate and prosecute individuals who endanger the public by disregarding pharmaceutical regulations and safety protocols.”“Today’s conviction is another important step in holding those accountable who put public health at risk.” said Special Agent in Charge Donna L. Neves, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Inspector General.  “The VA Office of Inspector General will continue to work diligently with our law enforcement partners to ensure veterans receiving care at VA medical centers receive safe and unadulterated medications.”“Today’s verdict in Glenn Chin's trial reflects the hard work of law enforcement agencies and the Department of Justice who are committed to keeping the American public safe,” said Shelly Binkowski, Inspector in Charge of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Boston Division.  “Chin’s conviction cannot undo the harm that was caused in the nation's largest public health crisis resulting from a pharmaceutical product but it can show that those responsible will be held accountable for their actions.”Chin faces a sentence of no greater than 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release, a fine of $250,000 and restitution on each count of the racketeering, racketeering conspiracy and mail fraud charges.  Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.Acting U.S. Attorney William D.

Harrington, Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District ofWashington, announced that Cory J. Riehart, age 32, of Omak, Washington, was sentenced in the United States District Court after pleading guilty in July 2017 to Adulterating a Drug and to Misbranding a Drug with the Intent to Defraud or Mislead. United States District Judge Stanley A. Bastion sentenced Riehart to a 27-month term of imprisonment and a one-year term of court supervision following release from Federal prison. The Judge also ordered Riehart to pay $1,230 in restitution. Riehart has been in custody since July 21, 2017.According to information disclosed during court proceedings, while working as a registered nurse at a local hospital, Riehart adulterated and misbranded three vials and seventy-nine carpujects of pain medication that were intended for patients. A carpuject is a syringe device for the administration of injectable fluid medications. Riehart removed morphine and hydromorphone directly from the carpujects and vials, refilled the carpujects and vials with saline solution, and then returned the refilled, misbranded and adulterated medications to the hospital’s locked narcotics drawers outside the nurse’s station and emergency room. Hospital staff discovered the adulterated and misbranded medications during routine narcotics counts, removed the drugs to the Pharmacy and notified the Republic, Washington Police Department. Subsequent chemical analysis by the DEA confirmed that the pain medications had been adulterated and misbranded because they contained less than one-tenth of one percent of the volume of controlled substance specified on the drug manufacturer label for each medication.Acting United States Attorney Harrington said, “Adulterating pain medications intended for patients seeking treatment in a hospital is not only a breach of the public’s trust in the medical profession, but is a callous disregard of basic human compassion for people suffering pain. The United States Attorney’s Office in this District has and will prosecute aggressively any such criminal conduct.”“Putting patients and their treatment at risk is never acceptable,” said Lisa Malinowski, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, Los Angeles Field Office. “The FDA will continue to pursue all individuals, including health care workers, who adulterate and misbrand drugs.”This investigation was conducted by the U.S. Food and drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations; DEA and the Republic, Washington Police Department. The case was prosecuted by George J.C. Jacobs, III, an Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington.CR-16-00169-SAB"

(“Med-Fast”) have agreed to resolve criminal and civil charges associated with Med-Fast’s improper submission of claims to the Medicare and Medicaid programs, Acting United States Attorney Soo C. Song announced today.As part of this global resolution, the former Vice President of Store Operations for Med-Fast, defendant Gino Cordisco, 47, of Mars, Pennsylvania, has been charged with one count of conspiracy related to his participation in a scheme to fill prescriptions for nursing homes with recycled unused drugs that were commingled with drug stocks on hand at Med-Fast’s Institutional Pharmacy. Defendant Iserve Technologies, Inc., which is co-located with and operated out of Med-Fast, participated in the same scheme, and was similarly charged with conspiracy. These criminal charges follow the earlier guilty plea on related charges of Correna Pfeiffer, 37, of Monaca, Pennsylvania, who previously served as the manager of the Med-Fast Institutional Pharmacy.Med-Fast Pharmacy, Inc., its owner Douglas Kaleugher, and related entities also have agreed to pay the United States $2,666,300.00 to settle civil False Claims Act allegations. The civil settlement resolves allegations in two separate whistleblower lawsuits filed in federal court in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The settled claims contended that Med-Fast violated the False Claims Act by distributing and submitting claims to Medicare for medication that it had either recycled from long-term care facilities serviced by its institutional pharmacy, or that otherwise differed from the medications identified as part of the claims submitted to the United States. The settlement also resolves allegations that Med-Fast violated the False Claims Act by submitting claims to Medicare and Pennsylvania Medicaid that sought reimbursement for the retail-packaged version of diabetes testing strips, while actually supplying patients with cheaper mail-order-packaged version of the same strips.“These criminal and civil agreements demonstrate our commitment to safeguarding the integrity of federal health care programs and the safety and well-being of the public,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Song. “Pharmacists and pharmacies must deal fairly and honestly with federal health care programs, and this U.S. Attorney’s Office will hold accountable those who do not.”These matters were investigated by The U.S. Food and Drug Administration-OCI, the Drug Enforcement Administration-Diversion Investigators, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Nelson P. Cohen prosecuted the criminal cases on behalf of the government and Assistant U.S. Attorney Colin J. Callahan litigated the civil cases on behalf of the Affirmative Civil Enforcement Section of the United States Attorney’s Office.The civil cases resolved by this settlement are captioned United States ex rel. Darla Reid v. Med-Fast Pharmacy, Inc., Civil Action No. 13-715 (WDPA); and United States ex rel. Bryan Bisceglia v. Med-Fast Pharmacy, Inc. et al., Civil Action No. 13-0368 (WDPA). The claims resolved by the civil settlement are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability. The conspiracy charge against Cordisco carries a maximum total sentence of 5 years in prison, a fine of $250,000 or both. The conspiracy charge against Iserve Technologies, Inc. carries a maximum total sentence of 5 years probation, a fine of $500,000 or both. Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the actual sentence imposed is based upon the seriousness of the offenses and the prior criminal history, if any, of the defendant.Topic(s):False Claims ActComponent(s):USAO - Pennsylvania, Western###"

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseOctober 2, 2017United States Department of JusticeNorthern District of AlabamaBIRMINGHAM – Federal prosecutors today charged the owner of a Decatur compounding pharmacy with conspiracy to defraud a federal health insurance program out of more than $10 million. U.S. Attorney Jay E. Town, Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigation, Miami Field Office, Special Agent in Charge Justin Green and Defense Criminal Investigative Service Special Agent in Charge John F. Khin announced the charge.The U.S. Attorney’s Office charged JOHN CHRISTOPHER LEMLEY, 51, of Decatur, with the conspiracy and seeks to have him forfeit nearly $1 million as proceeds of the fraud. Most of that amount already has been seized from bank accounts held by Lemley or his businesses, according to the charges.In conjunction with the one-count information filed in U.S. District Court, prosecutors also filed a plea agreement with Lemley. As part of that agreement, Lemley agrees to forfeit $918,234, along with a 2015 Lexus Gx-460 Premium purchased with criminal proceeds. Lemley must appear before a judge to formally enter a guilty plea.“This defendant took part in a conspiracy that employed improper contracts, kickbacks, mislabeled drugs and prescription forgeries in order to bilk millions of dollars from the federal health insurance program meant for America’s military members and their families,” Town said. “The FDA and DCIS did a tremendous job uncovering this fraud and our office remains committed to prosecuting every single one of these types of cases.”“American consumers rely on FDA to ensure that their drugs are safe, effective and properly labeled,” Green said. “Today’s announcement should serve as a reminder of our continued focus on those who put profits ahead of the U.S. public health by distributing misbranded products.”“In concert with our investigative partners, DCIS aggressively pursues fraud and corruption that undermines the integrity of Department of Defense programs, especially those involving the well-being of our Warfighters who deserve the best medical care available,” Khin said. “It is unconscionable for a health care provider to make profits by taking advantage of military members and their families when they are most vulnerable.”Lemley owned a Decatur pharmacy that operated as Southern Compounding. He also owned Apotheca Supply, which was licensed to relabel and repackage pharmaceutical drugs and was located in a suite that adjoined Southern Compounding on U.S. Highway 31 South. Lemley also had a 20 percent membership interest in Medworx Sunflower LLC, an affiliate of Medworx Compounding, a compounding pharmacy in Ridgeland, Miss., according to the information and plea agreement.Between February 2015 to January 2016, Lemley conspired with others at Medworx Sunflower and Southern Compounding to defraud TRICARE, a U.S. Department of Defense health care program, and third-party prescription-drug program administrators Express Scripts Incorporated and OptumRx Inc., according to the court documents.Southern Compounding submitted prescription reimbursement claims to TRICARE as part of ESI’s pharmacy network. The pharmacy submitted claims to various insurance plans as part of OptumRx’s pharmacy network.As part of the conspiracy, Lemley conducted the fraud by various means that included improperly contracting with Medworx Compounding to refer prescriptions to Southern Compounding, paying kickbacks to independent sales representatives as incentive to refer TRICARE prescriptions, selling misbranded over-the-counter medications as prescription drugs and not reversing claims on prescriptions Lemley knew were forged, according to the court documents.Although ESI’s regulations prohibited Southern Compounding from subcontracting any of its work, Southern entered a management agreement with Medworx in early 2015 whereby Medworx referred prescriptions to Southern Compounding, according to Lemley’s plea agreement. Southern filled the prescriptions, billed third-party administrators for them and sent almost all the payments received to Medworx. Medworx then returned a portion of those payments directly to Lemley, the plea agreement says. The amount returned totaled $918,234, representing a distribution for Lemley’s 20 percent membership interest in Medworx Sunflower.Southern Compounding’s billings to TRICARE soared in the two months after Southern entered its agreement with Medworx, according to the plea agreement. In the 13 months prior to the agreement, TRICARE paid claims of about $215,561 to Southern. In the two months following the February 2015 agreement, TRICARE, through ESI, paid about $10.5 million in claims to Southern, according to the plea agreement. More than 90 percent of that was profit.In accordance with Southern’s management agreement with Medworx, Lemley transferred most of the money – about $10.2 million – to Medworx. Most of the transferred money was to fund kickbacks to the independent sales representatives, according to the plea agreement.Lemley faces a maximum sentence of 5 years in prison.FDA-OCI and DCIS investigated the case, which Assistant U.S. Attorney Chinelo Dike-Minor is prosecuting.###Component(s):USAO - Alabama, Northern"

Hollander sentenced Kendra Westmoreland, age 55, of Randallstown, Maryland, to two years in prison, followed by one year of supervised release for receiving and delivering an adulterated or misbranded device, in connection with her receipt and use of polydimethylsiloxane, which she misrepresented to customers as medical grade silicone. Judge Hollander also ordered Westmoreland pay a fine of $2,500.The sentence was announced by Acting United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Stephen M. Schenning; Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack of the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Field Office; and Chief Terrence B. Sheridan of the Baltimore County Police Department.According to her plea agreement, from October 2000 through October 4, 2015, Westmoreland received polydimethylsiloxane, a silicon-based organic polymer that she injected directly into the bodies of victim customers for money or some other payment.  Westmoreland intentionally defrauded and misled individuals by representing polydimethylsiloxane as “medical grade” silicone and approved for injecting directly into the human body. Westmoreland also indicated that she was medically licensed to perform the procedure. In fact, Westmoreland was never a licensed medical practitioner and silicone is not approved by the FDA for this purpose.As a result of her representations, victim customers came to her residence, or to hotel rooms, to have polydimethylsiloxane injected directly into their buttocks and other places on their bodies, for larger and fuller buttocks or to shape other areas of their bodies. Westmoreland also traveled to other locations for the same purpose. Westmoreland typically charged customers $250 to $500 per session, and estimated that she had injected thousands of customers, who she claimed found her through word of mouth, or through her business website.  On October 4, 2015, a search warrant was executed at Westmoreland’s residence.  A room of her home was set up to resemble an operating room, including medical equipment and collages of photographs of individuals exposing their buttocks, representing a sampling of those who Westmoreland had injected with silicone. A forensic search of Westmoreland’s cellular phone revealed 126 individuals listed in her contacts as clients.  A financial audit of Westmoreland’s finances for the period from December 2011 to October 2015 revealed cash deposits of $227,994.01, and additional deposits of $48,801.06, for a total of $276,795.07.  The audit indicated no tax payments and no tax returns filed during that period.Westmoreland admitted that she stored the polydimethylsiloxone in a plastic container that was not properly labeled for medical use. When injected into humans, liquid silicone is a medical device subject to the regulation of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Polydimethylsiloxane is not approved, exclusively or as a component, for body-contouring.  Polydimethylsiloxane is used in the manufacture of shampoos (to make hair shiny and slippery), food (as an antifoaming agent), caulking, lubricants, kinetic sand, and heat-resistant tiles.Acting United States Attorney Stephen M. Schenning commended the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations and Baltimore County Police Department for their work in the investigation.  Mr. Schenning thanked Assistant United States Attorney Judson T. Mihok, who prosecuted the case.Component(s):USAO - Maryland"

U.S. District Court Senior Judge Douglas P. Woodlock scheduled sentencing for Nov. 29, 2017.In April 2017, Bauman and five others were arrested andchargedwith various offenses related to the steroid operation. According to court documents, from approximately May 2015 until April 12, 2017, the defendants manufactured steroid products - made from raw materials purchased overseas - and marketed them as “Onyx” steroids using “Onyx” labels that were also ordered from overseas suppliers. Onyx, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen Inc., was a global biopharmaceutical company that did not manufacture steroids.Bauman had a robust social media following on Instagram and other social media platforms under the moniker “musclehead320” and derivations of that name. Baumann used the “musclehead 320” persona to promote Onyx by claiming to be an “Onyx Sponsored Athlete.” As “musclehead 320,” he publicly denied any suggestion that he was directly involved with making or selling Onyx; however, at the same time, he was in fact marketing Onyx injectable steroids through other social media accounts, including Instagram accounts in the name of “onyx_roid” and “onyxpharma.” Through these accounts, Bauman provided customers with email addresses to place orders, received steroid orders, and then communicated with customers via these email addresses.Baumann directed other members of the conspiracy to ship steroids to customers using the U.S. Postal Service. Customers paid for the steroids via money remitters, such as Western Union and MoneyGram. Baumann then directed other members of the conspiracy to pick up payments at multiple remitter locations using false identifications to attempt to avoid suspicion while picking up the significant proceeds.Bauman purchased both the oral steroids (tablets) and the raw materials to manufacture the injectable steroids from overseas suppliers. He also ordered the counterfeit Onyx labeling and packaging from overseas suppliers. The injectable steroids advertised and sold by the members of this conspiracy bore trademarks of Onyx Pharmaceuticals.Further, Bauman also laundered proceeds from the steroid sales through Wicked Tan LLC, a tanning salon located in Beverly, which he and a co-conspirator owned and operated specifically to launder the proceeds of the steroid operation.The charges of conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit drugs and conspiracy to distribute controlled substances provide for a sentence of no greater than five years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss of the conspiracy. The charge of possession of a controlled substance provides for a sentence of no greater than 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss of the conspiracy. The charge of trafficking in counterfeit drugs provides for a sentence of no greater than 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $5 million. The charge of money laundering conspiracy provides for a sentence of no greater than 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $500,000 or twice the gross gain or loss of the conspiracy. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.Acting United States Attorney William D.

Smith, Speck pleaded guilty to an information charging him with possession with the intent to distribute steroids, distribution of a misbranded drug, and money laundering.Speck’s guilty plea is announced by Acting United States Attorney Stephen G. Dambruch; Jeffrey Ebersole, Special Agent in Charge of the New York Field Office of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations; Joel P. Garland, Special Agent in Charge, Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation; Shelly A. Binkowski, Inspector in Charge of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Boston Division; and Matthew J. Etre, Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations for New England.According to information presented to the Court, on March 20, 2017, federal investigators executed a court-authorized search of Speck’s residence, and encountered items associated with the receipt, packaging and resale of steroids and other performance enhancing drugs. The residence also contained numerous labels containing the name under which he sold steroids, TabMan Pharmaceuticals.Investigators also seized various false identification documents, ledgers, and cash. The ledgers show that from approximately June 2015 to the date of the search, Speck received $536,000 from the sale of steroids and other drugs. Investigators also seized two firearms from Speck’s residence, and a loaded firearm found stashed in his vehicle.According to information presented to the Court, Speck had been ordering Testosterone Cipionate from China since at least the beginning of 2015, repackaging the drug and selling it to his customers. At no time either upon receipt by the defendant nor after repackaging it under the name “TabMan Pharmaceuticals” did the testosterone contain labeling specifying directions for its use.Speck conducted his drug transactions through third party, member only, and web based steroid boards to connect with potential customers. He communicated with his customers, many of whom were professional and amateur bodybuilders, and distributors of raw products utilizing encrypted emails and varying email addresses. He utilized text message software that would eliminate texts after they were read.To conceal the movement of funds, Speck utilized various money remittance services, utilizing false names to conceal his identity as both the sender and recipient of tainted funds.  Speck, his customers and distributors of raw product, utilized regularly changing intermediary nominees, domestically and abroad, to receive money remittances.The defendant also used crypto-cyber currency, Bitcoin, to conceal both the purchase and sales of products.According to court documents, Speck will forfeit to the government the three firearms and a total of $17,954 in cash seized during the court authorized search of his home; and will, based on his narcotics trafficking, as charged in the information, forfeit a sum of money equal to the total value of forfeitable assets, in the amount of $536,000.Additionally, the government and Speck have agreed that for the purpose of calculating the appropriate sentencing guideline range, the defendant possessed a dangerous weapon in connection with drug trafficking and the defendant distributed an anabolic steroid to an athlete.Speck is scheduled to be sentenced on November 3, 2017 by U.S. District Court Chief Judge William E. Smith.The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Dulce Donovan and Mary E. Rogers, with the assistance of Assistant U.S. Attorney John P. McAdams.The matter was investigated by the Rhode Island FDA Office of Criminal Investigations task force, IRS Criminal Investigation, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and Homeland Security Investigations.The Rhode Island FDA Office of Criminal Investigations task force is comprised of agents and officers from the FDA, IRS, DEA, HSI, Rhode Island State Police and the East Providence, North Providence and Westerly Police Departments.###Topic(s):Drug TraffickingFinancial FraudComponent(s):USAO - Rhode IslandContact:Jim Martin (401) 709-5357 email: USARI.Media@usdoj.gov on Twitter @USAO_RIPress Release Number:17-99"

Baum, a licensed practical nurse who worked at the hospice ward of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, in Albany, improperly accessed syringes that contained oxycodone hydrochloride. These syringes were stored in locked containers that Baum was able to access using his individually assigned password. Between April 8, 2014 and May 16, 2014, Baum removed the oxycodone hydrochloride from at least 25 syringes and replaced it with haloperidol.Oxycodone hydrochloride, a Schedule II controlled substance, is a highly addictive narcotic analgesic used to treat moderate to severe pain. Haloperidol, often marketed as Haldol, is an anti-psychotic medication used to treat certain mental/mood disorders and to treat uncontrolled movements or agitation.This case was investigated by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General and the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, and was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth R.

The victim underwent a major surgery to remove the substance injected into her buttocks, and she will need further medical procedures, according to the affidavit.According to the complaint, the FDA has never approved the use of silicone for the purpose of body contouring, even when administered by a medical doctor. “Injections of silicone for body contouring purposes, especially deep tissue injections into the buttocks of the large amounts of silicone that would be required to achieve visible buttocks augmentation and enhancement, present serious risks and dangers,” the affidavit states. “Included among the risks of such injections are the potential of injection into a blood vessel resulting in embolism, migration of injected silicone to other bodily regions and resultant interference with organs and bodily systems, serious sepsis infection and infection-related disorders, silicone-filled scar tissue formations (“granulomas”), necrosis, skin discoloration, immune system hyperactivity and related adverse systemic conditions, disfigurement, discomfort, and pain.”Diaz is expected to make her first court appearances this afternoon in United States District Court.A criminal complaint contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed to be innocent until and unless proven guilty in court.If she was convicted of the three charges in the complaint, Diaz would face a statutory maximum sentence of 26 years in federal prison.This case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Joseph O. Johns, chief of the Environmental and Community Safety Crimes Section, and Assistant United States Attorney Amanda M. Bettinelli of the Environmental and Community Safety Crimes Section.Release No. 17-128"

The defendants are scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court in Boston at 3:00 p.m.According to the criminal complaint, the defendants engaged in a scheme to produce and market illegal steroids by purchasing raw materials and supplies, marketing the steroids on social media and selling them to customers across the country via email. It is alleged that the defendants marketed the steroids as being made by “Onyx Pharmaceuticals,” using both the Onyx name and symbols; however, Onyx, a pharmaceutical company owned by Amgen, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company based in California, does not manufacture liquid steroids. The defendants allegedly made the steroids themselves, using raw steroids imported from overseas, including from China. Bauman promoted the steroids through his social media persona, “musclehead 320,” claiming in his public posts that he was merely “sponsored” by “Onyx.” In addition, Bauman, Goodwin and Sclafani opened Wicked Tan, a tanning salon in Beverly, which allegedly served as a front to launder funds and purchase supplies for the conspiracy.The charge of conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit drugs provides a sentence of no greater than five years in prison, three years of supervised release, a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain/loss, whichever is greater.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseMarch 22, 2017United States Department of JusticeCentral District of CaliforniaLOS ANGELES– A Diamond Bar man who illegally imported the active ingredients used in erectile dysfunction drugs such as Viagra and Cialis and repackaged the drugs for sale as herbal sexual enhancement products pleaded guilty today to federal charges.Joseph Jinn, also known as Tzong Hwan Jinn, 60, pleaded guilty this afternoon to one count of conspiring to bring the drugs into the United States by means of false statements.In a plea agreement filed in United States District Court, Jinn admitted being part of a scheme that imported Tadalafil, Sildenafil and Dapoxetine – the active ingredients in pharmaceutical medications such as Viagra and Cialis – with false claims to customs officials that the multi-kilogram shipments were “cooked powder and tools,” “Chinese bread baking mixture,” and other innocuous materials. U.S. Customs and Border Protection intercepted some of the shipments, which had a cumulative value of nearly $550,000.But some of the illegally imported drugs entered the United States. Jinn admitted in court that he and his co-conspirators repackaged and sold the drugs as an “herbal supplement sexual enhancer.” The products were sold without the necessary prescriptions required by regulations enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which had previously warned Jinn’s company that it was engaged in illegal sales.According to the plea agreement, the FDA “issued public warnings regarding these sexual supplements because they contain ingredients that can interact with other drugs in dangerous ways and may lower blood pressure to unsafe levels.”“These products were falsely and dangerously marketed as herbal supplements, when in truth they were unregulated prescription medications that are harmful to some people,” said Acting United States Attorney Sandra R. Brown. “The scheme began with a smuggling operation, and the conduct continued with the distribution of supplements falsely labeled as natural and safe.”The products marketed by Jinn and his co-conspirators were sold in storefronts and over the internet.As part of his plea agreement, Jinn agreed to forfeit to the United States approximately $105,000 that was seized from three bank accounts during the investigation.“When it comes to purchasing medications online or in storefronts, never has the expression ‘buyer beware’ had a greater ring of truth,” said Joseph Macias, special agent in charge for Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Los Angeles. “Imposter drugs pose a serious threat to consumers who mistakenly assume these substances are safe. The reality is that unscrupulous providers who introduce untested products into the marketplace purely to turn a profit are putting their unwitting clients in harm’s way.”“The FDA oversees the production and sale of prescription drugs to ensure that they are safe and effective,” said Lisa L. Malinowski, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Los Angeles Field Office. “Criminals who attempt to sell medicines outside of FDA’s oversight put the health of U.S consumers at risk. Our office will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who endanger the public’s health.”The FDA haswarned consumersabout numerous over-the-counter products that claim to be “herbal,” but in fact contain hidden active ingredients.Jinn pleaded guilty before United States District Judge Christina A. Snyder, who scheduled a sentencing hearing for June 19. When he is sentenced, Jinn will face a statutory maximum sentence of five years in federal prison.The investigation in this case was conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations; the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations; the Los Angeles Police Department; and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.The case against Jinn is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Vicki Chou and Jennie L.

U.S. District Court Judge Richard G. Stearns scheduled sentencing for June 21, 2017.In 2012, 753 patients in 20 states were diagnosed with a fungal infection after receiving injections of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) manufactured by NECC. Of those 753 patients, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 64 patients in nine states died. The outbreak was the largest public health crisis ever caused by a pharmaceutical product.Specifically, Cadden directed and authorized the shipping of contaminated MPA to NECC customers nationwide. In addition, he authorized the shipping of drugs before test results confirming their sterility were returned, never notified customers of nonsterile results, and compounded drugs with expired ingredients. Furthermore, certain batches of drugs were manufactured, in part, by an unlicensed pharmacy technician at NECC. Cadden also repeatedly took steps to shield NECC’s operations from regulatory oversight by the FDA by claiming to be a pharmacy dispensing drugs pursuant to valid, patient-specific prescriptions. In fact, NECC routinely dispensed drugs in bulk without valid prescriptions. NECC even used fictional and celebrity names on fake prescriptions to dispense drugs such as “Michael Jackson,” “Freddie Mae” and “Diana Ross.”Cadden faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison on each of the mail fraud and racketeering counts.

Karavetsos of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations made the announcement.In addition to imposing a prison sentence, U.S. District Judge James C. Mahan of the District of Nevada ordered defendant Dmitriy V. Melnik, 30, of Las Vegas, remit $200,000 in restitution and forfeit $1.2 million in proceeds derived from the scheme as well as property seized during the investigation.  Melnik pleaded guilty before Judge Mahan on Sept. 8, 2016, to one count of conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit goods and to introduce into interstate commerce misbranded devices.According to the plea agreement, Melnik imported large quantities of colored contact lenses from the People’s Republic of China and South Korea that he knew were counterfeit and/or unauthorized by the FDA for sale in the United States.  Many of these contact lenses bore labels with counterfeit trademarks for Ciba Vision FreshLook COLORBLENDS, which are manufactured by Novartis International AG (Novartis), and others bore labels of contact lense brands produced and sold in Asia, he admitted.As stipulated in the plea agreement, contact lenses—even decorative ones—are medical devices that if not fitted, worn, or cared for properly can result in serious eye injury including blindness, and must receive prior FDA authorization to enter the U.S. and be further distributed.  Melnik admitted, however, that he sold purportedly “authentic” contact lenses to tens of thousands of customers around the United States without a prescription, adequate directions for use or adequate warnings.  After purchasing the contact lenses, many customers complained directly to Melnik about the quality of the contact lenses and questioned Melnik about whether the contact lenses were genuine and FDA approved.  Melnik admitted that many of the contact lenses that he sold were substandard, and that some were tested and found to be contaminated with a potentially dangerous bacteria.As stated in the plea agreement, a substantial part of the fraudulent scheme was committed from outside the United States, and Melnik received at least $1.2 million in gross revenue from this illegal enterprise, including approximately $200,000 alone from the sale of counterfeit Ciba Vision FreshLook COLORBLENDS.Anyone with information about individuals committing intellectual property offenses can report those crimes to the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center by going tohttp://www.iprcenter.gov/referralor calling (866) IPR-2060.The prosecution is the result of an ongoing multiagency effort to combat counterfeit, illegally imported and unapproved contact lenses called Operation Double Vision.  The FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations led the investigation, with significant support from the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations.  Senior Counsel Matthew A. Lamberti of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel J.

Mizer, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.  “We rely every day on food processors and handlers to meet the high standards required to keep our food free of harmful contamination.”In February 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that an ongoing outbreak of salmonellosis cases in the United States could be traced to Peter Pan and private label peanut butter produced and shipped from the company’s Sylvester, Georgia, peanut butter plant.  The company voluntarily terminated production at the plant on Feb. 14, 2007, and recalled all peanut butter manufactured there since January 2004.  The CDC eventually identified more than 700 cases of salmonellosis linked to the outbreak with illness onset dates beginning in August 2006.  The CDC estimated that thousands of additional related cases went unreported.  The CDC did not identify any deaths related to the outbreak.The criminal information specifically alleged that on or about Dec. 7, 2006, the company shipped from Georgia to Texas peanut butter that was adulterated, in that it contained salmonella and had been prepared under conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with salmonella.  The company admitted in the plea agreement that samples obtained after the recall showed that peanut butter made at the Sylvester plant on nine different dates between Aug. 4, 2006, and Jan. 29, 2007, was contaminated with salmonella.  Environmental testing conducted after the recall identified the same strain of salmonella in at least nine locations throughout the Sylvester plant.“Consumers are at the mercy of food merchants when it comes to the wholesomeness and healthiness of the food we consume and, as the result, a great responsibility is imposed by law on those merchants and manufacturers,” said U.S. Attorney G. F. “Pete” Peterman III for the Middle District of Georgia.  “Likewise, agriculture is Georgia’s largest industry and peanuts and peanut products are a major factor in the health of that industry.  While ConAgra did take corrective action eventually, by failing to timely recognize and rectify the problem of salmonella contamination, this company damaged the health of both public consumers and of the agricultural industry overall.  I commend my staff, that of the Consumer Protection Branch of the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, and the investigators of the FDA, for the excellent work by all in bringing this incident to this conclusion and I hope that it will serve as a reminder to others in the industry of the high cost of failing to protect the public that relies on them to properly meet this responsibility.”As part of the plea agreement, the company admitted that it had previously been aware of some risk of salmonella contamination in peanut butter.  On two dates in October 2004, routine testing at the Sylvester plant revealed what later was confirmed to be salmonella in samples of finished peanut butter.  Company employees attempting to locate the cause of the contamination identified several potential contributing factors, including an old peanut roaster that was not uniformly heating raw peanuts, a storm-damaged sugar silo, and a leaky roof that allowed moisture into the plant and airflow that could allow potential contaminants to move around the plant.  As stated in the plea agreement, while efforts to address some of these issues had occurred or were underway, the company did not fully correct these conditions until after the 2006 through 2007 outbreak.  In public statements after the 2007 recall, company officials hypothesized that moisture entered the production process and enabled the growth of salmonella present in the raw peanuts or peanut dust.The company also admitted in the plea agreement that between October 2004 and February 2007, employees charged with analyzing finished product tests at the Sylvester plant failed to detect salmonella in the peanut butter, and that the company was unaware some of the employees did not know how to properly interpret the results of the tests.“Product safety has to be a high priority for every manufacturer of foods sold in the United States” says Stephen M. Ostroff, Deputy Commissioner for Foods and Veterinary Medicine at the FDA. “FDA is working with food producers to promote compliance with food safety requirements, but if problems occur and are willfully ignored, we will use all available resources to protect American consumers from unsafe food.”Following the outbreak and shutdown, the company made significant upgrades to the Sylvester plant to address conditions the company identified after the 2004 incident as potential factors that could contribute to salmonella contamination.  The company also instituted new and enhanced safety protocols and procedures regarding manufacturing, testing and sanitation, which it affirmed in the plea agreement it would continue to follow.The case was prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Middle District of Georgia and the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch.  This matter was investigated by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations.1462Civil DivisionUSAO - Georgia, MiddleTopic:Consumer Protection"

Lee Bentley, III announces that a federal jury today found D. Anda Norbergs (61, Palm Harbor) guilty of 17 counts of receipt and delivery of misbranded drugs, 12 counts of smuggling goods into the United States, 11 counts of health care fraud, and 5 counts of mail fraud. She faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison for each mail fraud and smuggling offense, 10 years’ imprisonment for each health care fraud count, and 3 years for each count of receipt and delivery of misbranded drugs. Her sentencing hearing is scheduled for February 16, 2017.Norbergs was originally indicted on May 28, 2015. A second superseding indictment was returned on July 21, 2016.According to testimony and evidence presented at trial, Norbergs, a licensed physician in Florida, was the head doctor, owner, and operator of East Lake Oncology (“ELO”), a cancer treatment clinic located in Palm Harbor. Beginning in at least May 2009, she ordered, and directed others at ELO to order, drugs from foreign, unlicensed distributors, including Quality Specialty Products (“QSP”). The drugs sold to ELO by QSP and other foreign, unlicensed distributors were not FDA-approved. In fact, QSP had reportedly sold counterfeit versions of a chemotherapy medication that did not have the key ingredient in the drug. Norbergs learned of this news from other sources yet continued to have QSP drugs administered to patients. When QSP shut down, Norbergs switched to buying drugs from another foreign, unlicensed distributor. Many of the drugs were shipped directly to ELO from a location outside the United States, usually from the United Kingdom. The packaging and documents shipped with the drugs showed that they were manufactured and packaged for distribution in foreign countries, such as Turkey, India, and Germany. Additionally, some of the packaging for the drugs was in foreign languages, without any English translation.Unbeknownst to patients, these misbranded drugs were then administered at ELO. After administering these drugs to patients, ELO submitted claims for reimbursement to Medicare. In submitting those claims, Norbergs falsely represented that the FDA-approved versions of the drugs had been administered, when she knew that unapproved and misbranded versions had been given to patients.  In so doing, Norbergs intended to generate profits from the difference between the Medicare reimbursement rates for the FDA-approved drugs and the discounted prices of the misbranded versions of those drugs purchased from foreign distributors.This case was investigated by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services –  Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Ferrer, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and Robert J. West, Special Agent in Charge, United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Criminal Investigations, Miami Field Office, made the announcement.Kerri L. Kaley, 50, of Cold Spring Harbor, New York, was convicted by a jury in Miami on seven felony counts in a criminal case arising out of a Miami-based FDA investigation. Operation Miami Device has led to convictions in over twenty cases of medical device theft and has resulted in forfeitures, fines, and restitution totaling more than $5 million.Kaley was adjudicated guilty by the U.S. District Judge Darrin P. Gayles for her role in a conspiracy to transport and sell in interstate commerce various stolen prescription medical devices, the actual transport and sale of stolen medical devices, and money laundering associated with that activity.  Kaley is scheduled for sentencing on December 2, 2016 at 9:30 a.m.  She faces a term of imprisonment of up to 5 years on the conspiracy charge, a maximum sentence of up to 10 years on each of the 5 substantive counts of transporting stolen property, and up to 20 years on the money laundering conviction.  In addition to the period of incarceration, Kaley is also subject to fines on each of the 7 counts of up to $250,000 per count, or twice the intended gain or loss caused by the relevant conduct.  In lieu of facing a forfeiture hearing before the same jury, Kaley agreed to forfeit $500,000 to the United States, payable before her sentencing date.  Kaley also faces sentencing based on a November 2014 conviction arising in the same matter for obstruction of justice, which carries a potential sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.According to court records and testimony presented at trial, from approximately 1995 through February 2005, Kaley participated in a conspiracy with a group of individuals based in Long Island, New York.  The entire group, including Kaley, were medical device sales representatives for subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson. The Miami-based conspirator solicited sales representatives and other employees of medical device manufacturers, seeking to purchase medical devices for re-sale.  According to evidence presented in court, it was part of the conspiracy for Kaley and others working with her, to secure possession of significant quantities of prescription medical devices from hospitals they serviced for their employer, which were then forwarded to a conspirator in Delray Beach, Florida.  These devices were often state-of-the-art equipment used for minimally invasive surgery and the suture materials used throughout hospitals. According to three of Kaley’s co-conspirators who testified at trial, the devices were acquired by theft and fraud from their customer medical facilities, which were all New York non-profit hospitals. In the course of the illegal activity, Kaley laundered over $2.2 million in payments through two sham construction corporations and used the funds to pay the coconspirators, a home mortgage, home-renovation expenses, and child care.Charges remain pending against Brian K. Kaley, but no trial date has been set.Mr. Ferrer commended the investigative efforts of FDA- Office of Criminal Investigations.  The current case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Thomas Watts-FitzGerald, Brooke Watson, and Alison Lehr.  At the November 2014 trial, the United States was represented by Assistant United States Attorneys Thomas Watts-FitzGerald, Jerrob Duffy, and Alison Lehr.In the lengthy period between the Superseding Indictment and the most recent trial, this matter was taken to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals twice and later to the Supreme Court of the United States over issues relating to the pre-trial restraint of assets that the Grand Jury had included in the forfeiture allegation of the Indictment.  The government prevailed in that case by a 6 – 3 margin.  The United States was represented before the Eleventh Circuit by Assistant U. S. Attorney Madeleine Shirley of the Appellate Division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office.Related court documents and information may be found on the website of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida at www.flsd.uscourts.gov or on http://pacer.flsd.uscourts.govUSAO - Florida, SouthernTopic:Healthcare Fraud"

Hazel sentenced Vinnie Lysander Taylor, a/k/a “T,” age 44, of Wilmington, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Georgia, today to 14 years in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release, for receiving and selling industrial grade silicone, but representing to customers that it was medical grade silicone.  A client died as a result of receiving such injections.The sentence was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein; Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Angela D. Alsobrooks; Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack of the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Field Office; Chief Hank Stawinski of the Prince George’s County Police Department; and Chief J. Thomas Manger of the Montgomery County Police Department.“FDA regulates medical devices to protect the public from potentially dangerous complications and side effects. Industrial-grade silicone that is injected into individuals’ bodies can cause serious bodily injury or death,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Field Office. “FDA’s OCI will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to bring to justice those who offer such dangerous products to the public.”Taylor admitted that from at least 2008 through December 16, 2014, he administered silicone injections into the buttocks of customers who wanted larger or fuller buttocks. Taylor, who was not a licensed medical practitioner, falsely represented to customers and victims to whom he administered liquid silicone injections that the procedure was safe and that he used medical grade silicone, when in fact the silicone was not medical grade silicone. Taylor administered the injections in hotel rooms in Prince George’s County, Maryland, St. Louis, Missouri, Arlington, Virginia, and elsewhere. Taylor charged between $800 and $1000 for the initial injections and between $350 and $800 for subsequent injections. When used in this fashion, liquid silicone is a medical device subject to regulation by the FDA.In Maryland, between at least 2012 and December 2014, Taylor administered silicone injections to more than 10 individuals, representing to each victim that he used medical grade silicone and that it was safe.  In fact, Taylor did not use medical grade silicone, but used polydimethylsiloxane, a common silicone product used in commercial applications such as foods, lubricating oils, sealants and shampoos.On March 20, 2014, Taylor injected silicone into the buttocks of a victim.  After the victim left the hotel she began having breathing difficulties.  On March 22, 2014, the victim checked herself into the hospital and two days later, she died.  An autopsy determined that the cause of death was acute and chronic respiratory failure due to a foreign substance causing a pulmonary embolization.  The medical examiner ruled the manner of death to be a homicide.  A clear viscous fluid removed from the victim’s buttocks during the autopsy was determined to be polydimethylsiloxane.According his plea agreement, from approximately 2008 through December 2, 2014, Taylor purchased 152 gallons of food grade liquid silicone. Taylor stored the liquid silicone in plastic bottles that were not labeled nor approved by the FDA for that purpose.  Therefore, the liquid silicone was adulterated and misbranded.  The 152 gallons of silicone equates to 3,196 sessions.  At $500 per treatment, Taylor’s mid-range fee, proceeds from the illegal injections total at least $1,598,000.As part of his plea agreement, Taylor has agreed to plead guilty to a criminal information filed in Prince George’s County Circuit Court, admitting that his conduct resulted in the death of the victim in March 2014.  In exchange, the Prince George’s County State’s Attorney’s Office dismissed first degree murder charges which were pending against Taylor.Taylor remains detained.United States Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein praised the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Field Office, the Prince George’s County Police Department, Montgomery County Police Department, and the Prince George’s County State’s Attorney’s Office for their work in the investigation and prosecution.  Mr. Rosenstein thanked Assistant United States Attorney Deborah A.

Diwan admitted that he rebranded and relabeled drugs manufactured in India, including adding bogus FDA codes and markings to make it appear that the drugs had been manufactured in the United States or Europe and were approved for sale by the FDA. The drugs were shipped by Diwan to customers in numerous countries. Diwan did not sell misbranded and mislabeled drugs in the United States.Diwan’s guilty plea before U.S. District Court Chief Judge William E. Smith to conspiracy to engage in false labeling of pre-retail medical products, money laundering and immigration fraud is announced by United States Attorney Peter F. Neronha and George M. Karavetsos, Director of FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA OCI).“FDA is recognized around the globe for ensuring that drugs are safe and effective.  Criminal rings that falsify drugs’ origins to give the appearance of FDA approval put the public’s health at risk,” said George M. Karavetsos, Director of FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations. “We will investigate and bring to justice those who compromise the security of the pharmaceutical supply chain wherever they may be.”According to court records, an investigation by FDA OCI and the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Rhode Island determined that Diwan ordered large quantities of drugs manufactured by Sara International, a drug manufacturing company located in India, and had the drugs transported to the home of a co-conspirator in Belgium. Once in Belgium, the co-conspirator, Bart DeRidder, affixed fraudulent labels designed by and manufactured at the direction of Arif Diwan onto the products. The labels indicated that the drugs were manufactured by LifeLogic at a facility in Puerto Rico. The packaging also contained bogus FDA codes and markings to make it appear as if the drugs had received FDA approval. No such facility exists in Puerto Rico. Bart DeRidder has been charged by Belgian authorities in connection with this matter and is facing criminal prosecution in Belgium.Additionally, the investigation revealed that Arif Diwan created and provided fraudulent Certificates of Origin, attesting to the country of origin of the drugs, and fraudulent Certificates of Analysis, falsely attesting to the purity, strength, manufacture dates and expiration dates of the drugs. The certificates are heavily relied upon in the pharmaceutical industry and by Government entities to ensure the safety and efficacy of the products.In addition, the investigation revealed that Diwan illegally transferred funds out of the United States to promote his illegal activity, including a January 2014 sale of the drug Caelyx to a purchaser in the United Arab Emirates.In a related matter, in May 2012, Diwan filed a petition with the United States Citizen and Immigrations Services seeking permission for an Egyptian national to obtain a work visa, to allow the individual to enter the United States for the purpose of employment with Lifescreen. Diwan claimed that the person would be employed as a manager at a Lifescreen biopharmaceutical plant in Puerto Rico. The petition was approved and the person entered the United States in November 2012. Lifescreen did not, at any time, have or operate a biopharmaceutical plant in Puerto Rico.

(Pharmalogical) d/b/a Medical Device King and MDK, and Taranis Medical Corp. (Taranis), was sentenced to 60 months’ imprisonment and ordered to forfeit to the government close to $900,000 in criminal proceeds, following his conviction on November 12, 2015, after a six-week jury trial, of 64 felonies for mail and wire fraud, violations of the Food Drug & Cosmetic Act (FDCA), unlicensed wholesale distribution of prescription drugs, and multiple related conspiracy charges.The convictions arose from Scully’s leadership role in a long-running scheme to sell misbranded and unapproved pharmaceutical products, including chemotherapy drugs for infusion into Stage 4 cancer patients, to medical providers across the United States.   Evidence elicited at trial from 40 witnesses established that Scully deceived a wide array of doctors and cancer clinics into believing that he was selling legitimate FDA-approved products when, in reality, he was selling unapproved products imported through a series of unidentified middlemen in Turkey and elsewhere overseas.  Many of the products Scully sold were highly sensitive, so-called “cold-chain” biologic drugs that did not have FDA-required warnings of potentially deadly side effects.  The sentencing proceedings were held before U.S. District Judge Arthur D. Spatt.The sentence was announced by Robert L. Capers, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and Director George M. Karavetsos, Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, New York.“Those considering bypassing the FDA’s regulatory authority by selling unapproved and misbranded pharmaceutical products jeopardize the health and well-being of our nation’s patient population.  All such individuals are on notice that they will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” stated United States Attorney Capers.  Mr. Capers expressed his grateful appreciation to the FDA for its assistance in the investigation and prosecution of the defendant.“This sentence reflects the serious nature of the defendant’s actions,” said FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Director Karavetsos.  “Americans must have confidence that the drugs they are receiving are safe, effective and fully comply with U.S. laws.  Our office will aggressively pursue those who place patients at risk and who seek to profit from the importation and distribution of potentially dangerous foreign unapproved drugs.”Scully owned and operated Pharmalogical, MDK, and Taranis, which collectively sold over $17 million in pharmaceutical drugs and devices.  Scully purchased these products through wholesalers overseas and received them in the United States with shipping labels stating “product samples” with “no commercial value,” even though the packages often contained tens of thousands of dollars of misbranded and unapproved prescription drugs.  Scully would then execute “bait-and-switch” transactions with doctors by advertising FDA-approved products on his website but then sending them misbranded and unapproved products.  Several doctors and health care professionals testified at trial that Scully deceived them into believing that the drugs they were purchasing were FDA-approved and legal.  Ultimately, the drugs were infused into patients, including cancer patients and patients with Crohn’s disease.Scully continued to sell these drugs well after his office was searched by FDA agents and all of his existing products were seized.  To conceal the continued sales, he covertly set up a new company, Taranis, which he operated without a license and out of a storage space where he kept the drugs.  Even after that storage space was searched and additional products were seized, Scully continued selling products to unsuspecting doctors.The government’s case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Charles P. Kelly and Kenneth M. Abell.The Defendant:WILLIAM SCULLYAge: 47Residence:  Commack, New YorkUSAO - New York, EasternTopic:Financial FraudHealthcare FraudPrescription Drugs"

West, Special Agent in Charge, United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Office of Criminal Investigations’ Miami Field Office. “The FDA will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who place profits above the public health.”According to U.S. Attorney Horn, the charges, and other information presented in court:  Paul Chan owned and operated The Wholesale Source, LLC, a company that marketed and sold dietary supplements, primarily through affiliated websites includingwww.thatswholesale.com[external link]andwww.ephedrawholesale.com[external link].  From at least July 2005 through August 2012, Chan marketed and sold dietary supplements on his websites that contained ephedrine alkaloids.  In April 2004, the FDA published a final rule declaring dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids to be adulterated because they present an unreasonable risk of illness or injury.  Chan was warned by FDA investigators and others that it was illegal to sell dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids, but he continued to do so.Chan’s websites made materially false and misleading claims concerning the use of ephedrine, such as that ephedrine has been approved by the FDA for treatment of any disease, and that ephedrine has “never been illegal.”  The jury found that these false and misleading claims were designed to lure customers into believing that it was legal to purchase adulterated dietary supplements containing ephedrine, when it was not.  Chan sold over $4.5 million in dietary supplements with ephedrine alkaloids, including to customers in the Northern District of Georgia.Chenhsin Chan, a/k/a Paul Chan, 44, of Elmhurst, New York, was charged by a federal grand jury on May 29, 2014, with ten counts of mail fraud, ten counts of introducing adulterated food (namely, dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids) into interstate commerce, five counts of knowingly distributing a listed chemical (namely, ephedrine) without obtaining the required registration, and five counts of money laundering. The jury rendered a guilty verdict on all thirty counts of the indictment.In addition to its guilty verdict on the charges, the jury also criminally forfeited assets the defendant purchased with proceeds from the crimes, including real property in New York that had been purchased for $950,000, a Mercedes Benz purchased for over $50,000, and a Lamborghini Gallardo purchased for approximately $117,000, as well as over $666,000 in proceeds from the crimes.Sentencing for Chan has not yet been scheduled.This case is being investigated by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations.  The Drug Enforcement Agency provided valuable assistance.Assistant United States Attorneys Steven D.

Rosenstein; Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Angela D. Alsobrooks; Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack of the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Field Office; and Chief Hank Stawinski of the Prince George’s County Police Department.“Injecting industrial-grade silicone into individuals’ bodies can result in serious bodily injury or death,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark S. McCormack, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Field Office. “FDA’s OCI will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to bring to justice those who offer this dangerous product to the public.”Taylor admitted that from at least 2008 through December 16, 2014, he administered silicone injections into the buttocks of customers who wanted larger or fuller buttocks. Taylor, who was not a licensed medical practitioner, falsely represented to customers and victims to whom he administered liquid silicone injections that the procedure was safe and that he used medical grade silicone, when in fact the silicone was not medical grade silicone. Taylor administered the injections in hotel rooms in Prince George’s County, Maryland, St. Louis, Missouri, Arlington, Virginia, and elsewhere. Taylor charged between $800 and $1000 for the initial injections and between $350 and $800 for subsequent injections. When used in this fashion, liquid silicone is a medical device subject to regulation by the FDA.In Maryland, between at least 2012 and December 2014, Taylor administered silicone injections to more than 10 individuals, representing to each victim that he used medical grade silicone and that it was safe.  In fact, Taylor did not use medical grade silicone, but used polydimethylsiloxane, a common silicone product used in commercial applications such as foods, lubricating oils, sealants and shampoos.On March 20, 2014, Taylor injected silicone into the buttocks of a victim.  After the victim left the hotel she began having breathing difficulties.  On March 22, 2014, the victim checked herself into the hospital and two days later, she died.  An autopsy determined that the cause of death was acute and chronic respiratory failure due to a foreign substance causing a pulmonary embolization.  The medical examiner ruled the manner of death to be a homicide.  A clear viscous fluid removed from the victim’s buttocks during the autopsy was determined to be polydimethylsiloxane.According his plea agreement, from approximately 2008 through December 2, 2014, Taylor purchased 152 gallons of food grade liquid silicone. Taylor stored the liquid silicone in plastic bottles that were not labeled nor approved by the FDA for that purpose.  Therefore, the liquid silicone was adulterated and misbranded.  The 152 gallons of silicone equates to 3,196 sessions.  At $500 per treatment, Taylor’s mid-range fee, proceeds from the illegal injections total at least $1,598,000.As part of his plea agreement, Taylor has agreed to plead guilty to a criminal information that will be filed in Prince George’s County Circuit Court, admitting that Taylor’s conduct resulted in the death of the victim in March 2014.  In exchange, the Prince George’s County State’s Attorney’s Office dismissed first degree murder charges which were pending against Taylor.Taylor, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, and Prince George’s County State’s Attorney’s Office have agreed that if the Court accepts the plea agreement Taylor will be sentenced to between 12 and 15 years in prison.  U.S. District Judge George J. Hazel has scheduled sentencing for August 19, 2016 at 9:30 a.m.  Taylor remains detained.United States Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein praised the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Field Office, the Prince George’s County Police Department, and the Prince George’s County State’s Attorney’s Office for their work in the investigation and prosecution.  Mr. Rosenstein thanked Assistant United States Attorney Deborah A. Johnston and William D. Moomau, who are prosecuting the case.USAO - Maryland"

Alden pleaded guilty to one count of introducing an unapproved drug into interstate commerce.According to court documents and information presented to the court, a Rhode Island customer who purchased DNP from Alden, among other sources, died in October 2013 as a result of DNP ingestion. It cannot be established beyond a reasonable doubt whether or not the DNP sold by Alden caused the customer’s death.Alden’s guilty plea before U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge Stanley A. Boone is announced by United States Attorney Peter F. Neronha of the District of Rhode Island, United States Attorney Benjamin B. Wagner of the District of Eastern California, and Russell Herman, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations.According to court documents and information presented to the court, an investigation by a U.S. Food and Drug Administration task force in Rhode Island determined that between August 2013 and January 2014, the defendant sold DNP on eBay to customers throughout the United States including Rhode Island, advertising that the product was intended for human consumption as a weight loss product. DNP is a chemical used as a dye, wood preserver and herbicide among other things. Nevertheless, it has been marketed over the years as “extremely dangerous and not fit for human consumption” under the Food and Drug Cosmetic Act of 1938.According to court documents and information presented to the court, Alden made approximately $500 in profits from his DNP sales on eBay.Alden is scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge Stanley A.

Roberts has been arrested on charges that while falsely claiming to be a licensed medical practitioner, she illegally transported liquid silicone from Florida to Atlanta and that she caused the death of another person by injecting the liquid silicone directly into the victim's buttocks.“Roberts allegedly caused the death of another person by injecting her with silicone after falsely claiming she was a medical professional,” said U. S. Attorney John Horn. “The public should be wary of individuals who use substances like silicone in ways that are not approved by the FDA, or that are administered by persons who are not properly trained or licensed.”“The FDA protects the public’s health by ensuring, among other things, that medical devices are safe and effective for their intended uses,” said Robert J. West, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Miami Field Office. “We are fully committed to bringing to justice those who subvert FDA’s requirements and place unsuspecting American consumers at risk of serious harm by using unapproved and unsafe devices.”“It is always a tragedy when someone loses their life due to the reckless negligence of another. This death shows why there is a need for FDA oversight and highlights the dangers when the system is illegally circumvented. We are thankful for the successful indictment of Deanna Roberts and pray that other lives can be saved by removing her ability to perform this dangerous activity,” Chief John F. King, Doraville Police Department.“The underground operation of illegal injections has become more common and has threatened the health of victims,” said Atlanta Police Chief George N. Turner. “We will continue to work with our federal partners to combat this crime and expose perpetrators who risk the health of victims, for the sake of making a quick profit.”According to U.S. Attorney Horn, the indictment, and other information presented in court: liquid silicone is strictly regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and may be legally injected directly into the human body only as a treatment for certain eye conditions. In April, 2004, Roberts began ordering liquid silicone from a business in Arizona.  Before she was allowed to buy the silicone, however, she was required to certify that it was not intended to be injected into humans.  Roberts falsely swore that she did not intend to inject the silicone into humans.  Instead, she claimed that she intended to supply the silicone to a customer for use in lubricating medical equipment.  Between April 2004 and December 2015, Roberts purchased approximately 178 gallons of liquid silicone.  Roberts then allegedly transported the liquid silicone to the Atlanta area and injected it into the hips, buttocks, and other body parts of her customers.  Roberts falsely claimed to her victims that she was a licensed medical practitioner.On November 16, 2015, Roberts allegedly injected liquid silicone into the buttocks of a victim identified as L.H. in the indictment.  The indictment alleges that in doing so, Roberts caused the death of L.H. The indictment also alleges that Roberts injected another person with liquid silicone on the same date and that Roberts injected two others in October and November 2014.  These individuals, however, did not die from the injections.Deanna M. Roberts, 46, of Sanford, Florida, was arrested on May 17, 2016, and made her initial appearance on these charges in federal court in Orlando, Florida.Members of the public are reminded that the indictment only contains charges.  The defendant is presumed innocent of the charges and it will be the government’s burden to prove the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.This case is being investigated by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, the Doraville Police Department, and the Atlanta Police Department.Assistant United States Attorney William L.

Hayes. CRAIG GREER, 43, of Hollywood, Florida, was sentenced to 60 months in prison. KEVIN KOGAN, 48, of Cedar Park, Texas, was sentenced to 30 months in prison. At the sentencing hearing U.S. District Judge Richard A. Jones said the conspiracy “pumped into our community an enormous amount of drugs…impacting people you will never see but whose lives and families you destroyed by feeding their addiction.”GREER is a former police officer, who worked to promote the internet pharmacy scheme. GREER sent spam emails promoting the online pharmacy and made sure long-time customers got their drugs even if they did not have a valid prescription. In prior versions of the scheme, GREER used his history as a police officer to lull some doctors into thinking the online pharmacy operated within the law. GREER was also involved in overseas online pharmacies affiliated with lead defendant Juan Gallinal. In addition to the prison term, GREER was sentenced to three years of supervised release, including 250 hours of community service and a money judgment of $88,635.KOGAN set up the websites and servers for the online pharmacy, and attempted to hide the conspiracy’s databases from investigators. KOGAN not only handled the technology side of the operation, he lied to investigators, destroyed evidence and provided fraudulent information in response to a grand jury subpoena. Records show he moved a critical company database to a server overseas in an effort to frustrate the law enforcement investigation. In addition to the 30 month prison term, KOGAN was sentenced to three years of supervised release, including 150 hours of community service and a money judgment of $155,660.The internet pharmacy distributed drugs to some 200 customers in Washington State between 2009 and 2012. The pharmacy shipped hundreds of thousands of pills of hydrocodone, phentermine, alprazolam (Xanax) and codeine (Tylenol 4) to people across the country who did not have valid prescriptions for the narcotics. The conspiracy brought in more than $9 million in revenue from the sale of pills during the three year scheme. The pharmacy operated four internet sites through which they solicited customers and allowed customers in Washington State to order drugs. According to the indictment, the conspiracy would continue to refill prescriptions even if no valid prescription existed. In some instances the conspirators simply looked for a physician in the same geographic area as the customer, with a similar sounding name and filled the prescription using the physician’s DEA number without the physician’s knowledge. The pharmacy charged as much as ten times the usual price for the medications.The conspirators laundered the proceeds of their sales through a brick-and-mortar pharmacy in Florida called Discount Pharmacy of Pines. In June 2012, the DEA seized the websites, computers, and drug inventory associated with the illegal pharmacy.All but one of the defendants who were indicted in May 2014 have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing:The originator of the scheme, JUAN GALLINAL, 48, of Pembroke Pines, Florida is a former police officer from Virginia. He is scheduled for sentencing in October 2016.JORDAN TRUXELL, 26, of Davie, Florida served as the registered agent for Discount Pharmacy dba frontierpharmacies.com. He is scheduled for sentencing June 3, 2016.THOMAS BROOKE, 54, of Cooper City, Florida was the bookkeeper for Discount Pharmacy was sentenced March 18 to five years in prison.ALI LOVINS, 44, of Cooper City, Florida is a registered nurse and was the office manager for Discount Pharmacy.  LOVINS was sentenced March 4, 2016 to three years in prison.JERRY DELMAN, 83, of Miami, Florida, a pharmacist who ostensibly oversaw the prescriptions going out the door to customers is being evaluated for a medical condition that could impact his ability to participate in a trial.This was an Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) investigation, providing supplemental federal funding to the federal and state agencies involved.  The case was investigated by the Portland Tactical Diversion Squad which is comprised of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Portland Police Bureau.  Substantial investigative assistance was provided by the Food and Drug and Administration (FDA) – Florida, and DEA Miami Field Division.The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Mike Lang, Francis Franze-Nakamura and Brian Werner.USAO - Washington, WesternTopic:Cyber CrimeDrug Trafficking"

The indictment was returned on May 11, 2016.The indictment was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein; Special Agent in Charge Mark McCormack of the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Field Office; and Chief James W. Johnson of the Baltimore County Police Department.According to the indictment, from October 2000 through October 4, 2015, Westmoreland received polydimethylsiloxane, a silicon-based organic polymer, from China that she injected directly into the bodies of victim customers for money or some other payment.  When used in this fashion, liquid silicone is a medical device subject to the regulation of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Polydimethylsiloxane is not approved, exclusively or as a component, for body-contouring.  Polydimethylsiloxane is used in the manufacture of shampoos (to make hair shiny and slippery), food (as an antifoaming agent), caulking, lubricants, kinetic sand, and heat-resistant tiles.The indictment alleges that Westmoreland intentionally defrauded and misled individuals by representing polydimethylsiloxane as “medical grade” silicone and approved for injecting directly into the human body.  As a result of her representations, victim customers came to her residence in Windsor Mill to have polydimethylsiloxane injected directly into their buttocks and other places on their bodies, for larger and fuller buttocks or to shape other areas of their bodies.  Westmoreland also traveled to Miami, Florida, and other locations, for the same purpose.    According to the indictment, Westmoreland stored the polydimethylsiloxone in a plastic container that was not properly labeled for medical use, nor was Westmoreland a licensed medical practitioner or under the supervision of a licensed medical practitioner.If convicted, Westmoreland faces a maximum sentence of three years in prison.  An initial appearance is expected to be scheduled soon in U.S. District Court in Baltimore.An indictment is not a finding of guilt.  An individual charged by indictment is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty at some later criminal proceedings.United States Attorney Rod J.

Judge Hazel also entered an order requiring Smith to forfeit $2,102,684.06, the value of the misbranded drugs subject to seizure.The sentence was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J.

Specifically, the Kiralys purchased chemotherapy drugs from Warwick Healthcare Solutions Inc., also known as Richards Pharma, a former United Kingdom-based drug distributer that distributed non-FDA approved drugs throughout the United States. The Kiralys administered certain of these drugs to their patients, billing Medicare. One medication they purchased from Warwick was Altuzan, a drug not approved by the FDA. In addition, the FDA tested a batch of Altuzan that the Kiralys had purchased from Warwick and determined that it was counterfeit, lacking the active ingredient bevacizumab.“Our District has now pursued and resolved False Claims Act allegations against three doctors for improperly billing Warwick drugs to public insurers,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Talbert. “These cases demonstrate the commitment of our district to preserving the integrity of federal health care programs and ensuring that doctors participating in such programs provide their patients with safe and effective care.”“Patients getting life-saving prescriptions from their doctors must be able to trust that their medicines have been FDA-proven as safe and effective,” said Steven Ryan, Special Agent in Charge of the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “Our investigators tirelessly pursue those who ignore requirements protecting patient health in order to increase profits.”“Patients receiving cancer treatment drugs should be able to trust that these drugs have been the subject of the FDA-approval process, which requires that the drugs have been proven to be safe and effective for treating their medical conditions,” said Lisa L. Malinowski, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Los Angeles Field Office. “The FDA will continue its vigilance over the prescription-drug supply chain to ensure that the drugs reaching patients have been proven to be both safe and effective, and that those who attempt to circumvent the agency’s oversight will be brought to justice.”The case was investigated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General and the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations. Assistant United States Attorney Vincente A. Tennerelli represented the United States in this matter. The claims settled by this agreement are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability.####"

Lauderdale, Florida, to fifty (50) months in federal prison for his scheme to sell illegal and mislabelled diet pills to victims throughout the United States, including Louisiana.  HOAG was ordered to serve a two year term of supervised release following his release from imprisonment.  HOAG was also ordered to pay a fine of $7,500 and to forfeit all property traceable to the gross proceeds of the scheme, including but not limited to $679,116.33.At the conclusion of the sentencing, the Court ordered HOAG to begin serving his sentence immediately and remanded HOAG to the custody of the United States Marshal.On July 29, 2015, HOAG pled guilty to engaging in a conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute sibutramine, in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Sections 846 and 2, and introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce, in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Sections 331(a) and 2.  This conduct was part of a multi-state scheme to illegally distribute diet pills containing sibutramine, a Schedule IV controlled substance, which were falsely labeled and marketed as “all natural” dietary supplements. Sibutramine was the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Meridia, a prescription weight loss drug removed from the market in 2010 following studies that showed significantly increased risk of strokes and heart attacks.  Since the removal of Meridia, no drug containing sibutramine has been approved for use in humans in the United States.In a related case, on March 22, 2016, following a seven-day trial, a federal jury convicted DARLENE V. KRUEGER, age 54, of Destrehan, Louisiana, on three counts of distribution of sibutramine and three counts of introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce.  The sentencing date has not yet been set.U.S. Attorney Green stated:  “Today’s sentence sends a strong message to the community that my office and our law enforcement partners take the distribution of illegal drugs, in all forms, extremely seriously.  Those who peddle illegal substances in this district for profit will face stiff penalties, regardless of whether they peddle those drugs on our street corners or over the internet.  I want to express my sincere gratitude to the dedicated law enforcement agents and the prosecution team who investigated and prosecuted this complex case and dismantled this defendant’s drug distribution ring.”“Consumers are put at serious risk when they are unknowingly exposed to undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients in products falsely labeled as natural dietary supplements,” said Robert J. West, Special Agent-in-Charge, Miami Field Office, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations. “Our office will continue to defend the public’s health by ensuring that dietary supplements are accurately labeled, and do not contain dangerous undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients.”This matter was handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Louisiana and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, with the assistance from other FDA components; the Louisiana State Police; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Slidell, Louisiana, Police Department; and the Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, Police Department.  The matter was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Cam T. Le and Paul L. Pugliese.Health care professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse events or side effects related to the use of these products to the FDA.  For more information regarding dietary supplements and to report adverse events, please visit the FDA’s website athttp://www.fda.gov/Food/DietarySupplements/.USAO - Louisiana, MiddleTopic:Consumer ProtectionHealthcare Fraud"

Hochul, Jr. announced today that Leyla Samadi, 54, formerly of Buffalo, NY, currently of St. Mary’s County, Maryland, who was convicted of illegally obtaining controlled substances by fraud, was sentenced to five years’ probation by U.S. District Judge Elizabeth A. Wolford.“During a time that our community is fighting hard against the abuse of opiate and opioid drugs, this defendant stole pain medications from patients who genuinely needed them,” said U.S. Attorney Hochul. “Even worse, the defendant’s scheme meant that vulnerable patients were potentially injected with salt water by staff who thought they were administering medication. As we have demonstrated before, a person’s title or status as a health care or other professional will not immunize them from prosecution if the circumstances and law warrant.”Assistant U.S. Attorney George c. Burgasser, who is handling the case, stated that between November 22, 2014 and January 7, 2015, the defendant tampered with and stole the pain medications Demerol and Hydromorphone while working as a registered nurse at Sisters of Charity Hospital in Buffalo. Specifically, Samadi used her official status as a medical professional to log into the Hospital’s medicine dispensing machine (Pyxis). Samadi identified a particular patient that was in need of medicine, and requested a specific narcotic that she claimed would be administered the drug.Once Samadi obtained the narcotic from the Pyxis machine, rather than administer the medication to the patient, Samadi instead injected herself with the narcotic. Even more egregiously, the defendant thereafter replaced the missing medication with saline solution and returned it to the Pyxis machine. Once Samadi returned the vial to the Pyxis machine, Samadi cancelled the transaction claiming that she had selected the wrong medication or the wrong patient. The defendant’s illegal diversion scheme potentially exposed patients in true need of pain medication from the Hospital to nothing more potent that salt water.The sentencing is the culmination of an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, New York Field Office, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Russell Hermann, the New York State Attorney General’s Office, under the direction of Eric T. Schneiderman, New York State Department of Health, Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement, under the direction of Joshua Vinciguerra, and the New York State Office of the Attorney General, Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, under the direction of Chief Upstate Investigator William Falk.USAO - New York, Western"

Colasante, 59, a physician from Gainesville, Florida, was convicted yesterday of 162 counts of health care fraud.  The verdict was announced by Christopher P. Canova, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida.Colasante owned and operated medical businesses known as the Hawthorne Medical Center in Hawthorne, Florida, between 1998 and March 2009, and the Colasante Clinic in Gainesville, Florida, between January 2010 and January 2013.  Through these businesses, Colasante defrauded Medicare, Medicaid, and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida through a series of false billing schemes.  At trial, the government presented evidence that Colasante, and employees acting at her direction, ordered non-FDA approved drugs at a drastically reduced price, administered them to unsuspecting patients, and then fraudulently billed insurance companies for the cost of FDA-approved drugs.  The evidence showed that Colasante also billed insurance companies for medically unnecessary tests and submitted false diagnosis codes in support of her fraudulent claims for reimbursement.In addition, Colasante billed insurance companies for counseling, treatment, and training that was never performed.  Her businesses repeatedly submitted fraudulent billings for smoking-cessation treatment purportedly administered to patients who were non-smokers.Colasante faces up to 10 years’ imprisonment on each of the counts of conviction.  Sentencing is scheduled for July 25, 2016, at 10:00 a.m. at the United States Courthouse in Gainesville, Florida.United States Attorney Canova praised the work of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Florida Attorney General’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, and the United States Food and Drug Administration, whose joint investigation led to the convictions in this case.The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Tiffany H. Eggers and Ryan J. Love.“Health care programs and patients depend on ethical practices from medical providers,” said United States Attorney Canova.  “I commend the diligent investigators and prosecutors who uphold our federal laws and bring to justice those who abuse their positions of trust.”“The Medicare system relies on doctors to diagnose and treat beneficiaries,” stated Shimon Richmond, Special Agent in Charge of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General.  “When doctors intentionally misdiagnose patients, perform unnecessary tests and procedures, and use non-FDA approved drugs and devices on patients for personal gain, they betray the trust of the Medicare system and the patients themselves.”“This case is the result of coordination between multiple federal and state law enforcement agencies, working together to protect the American health care system.  Crimes committed through fraudulent and excessive claims are not victimless; Americans everywhere absorb the costs of those schemes through higher insurance costs and medical bills.  The FBI and their law enforcement partners will vigilantly identify those engaging in similar conduct and advocate for their prosecution,” said Michelle S.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseApril 29, 2016United States Department of JusticeSouthern District of New YorkPreet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Russell Hermann, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations, New York Field Office (“FDA-OCI”), announced that ROBIN DELEONROSA, a/k/a “Magic,” a/k/a “Robin Deleon Rosa,” a/k/a “Robin Rosa,” was arrested today for his role in a nationwide black market that distributed millions of dollars’ worth of fraudulently obtained HIV prescription drugs to unsuspecting consumers.  DELEONROSA personally obtained and sold more than $1.9 million worth of second-hand HIV prescription drugs.  In addition, a search earlier today of DELEONROSA’s residence in the Bronx resulted in the seizure of over 1,000 bottles of second-hand HIV prescription pills, with an estimated value of $1.8 million, as well as lighter fluid that was used to remove labels from the pill bottles, and over $70,000 in United States currency.  DELEONROSA will be presented later today in Manhattan federal court before Magistrate Judge Frank Maas.Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said: “As alleged, Robin Deleonrosa served as a middle-man in a black market scheme to illegally re-sell potentially dangerous or ineffective second-hand HIV medications to unsuspecting patients and pharmacies.  As a result of his alleged participation in this scheme, Deleonrosa endangered the health of unsuspecting patients needing these drugs, and defrauded Medicaid of more than an estimated $1.9 million.”FDA-OCI Acting Special Agent in Charge Russell Hermann said: “When prescription medications are diverted from the legal supply chain, there is no longer any assurance that the medicines are safe and effective.  Our office will pursue and bring to justice individuals who endanger the public’s health in this manner.”According to the Complaint unsealed today in Manhattan federal court[1]:From at least in or about September 2013 until April 2016, DELEONROSA was part of a black market distribution network that distributed bulk quantities of second-hand HIV prescription drugs to unsuspecting consumers.  In particular, the members of the black market distribution ring would initially obtain the HIV prescription drugs by purchasing these drugs from patients to whom these medications were originally prescribed.  The prescription HIV bottles were then collected and the labels (containing the patients’ names) were removed using dangerous substances, including lighter fluid and other potentially hazardous chemicals.  Through this process, the members of the black market distribution network made the bottles appear new in order to conceal the fact that the bottles had previously been dispensed to patients.  This process allowed the bottles eventually to be re-sold to pharmacies and unsuspecting consumers.  Consumers who eventually received these second-hand prescription HIV medications were not aware that the prescription bottles had been previously sold, treated with potentially hazardous chemicals, and possibly not stored under conditions sufficient to maintain their medical efficacy.In addition to placing consumers at significant risk, Medicaid and other health insurers were defrauded in multiple ways by DELEONROSA’s scheme.  On the front end, health care benefit enrollees, including Medicaid recipients who participated in this scheme, filled their prescriptions for little or no cost with the intention of selling the drugs into the underground black market rather than taking the drugs as prescribed to treat their illnesses.  Because health benefits, such as HIV prescription drugs, are for the sole use of the insured, Medicaid and other health care benefit plans would not have paid for such drugs if the beneficiaries had disclosed their intent to sell the medications rather than take them as prescribed.  On the back end, Medicaid was further defrauded by reimbursing pharmacies for the cost of prescription HIV drugs as if the drugs were new and obtained from a legitimate stream of commerce, when, in truth and in fact, the drugs were second-hand and came from the black market.  Accordingly, as result of this scheme, health care benefit plans, including Medicaid, were defrauded multiple times by paying for the same drugs twice.As is detailed in the Complaint, DELEONROSA served as a middleman in this scheme – selling hundreds of second-hand prescription HIV medication bottles to a cooperating source (“CS”) on multiple occasions, with a total estimated Medicaid reimbursement value of more than $1.9 million.  DELEONROSA stored these second-hand prescription HIV medication bottles in his residence in the Bronx, and provided the bottles to the CS in suitcases and a duffel bag.  Many of the HIV prescription bottles that DELEONROSA sold still bore the labels of the patients to whom the drugs were originally dispensed.  In 2014, DELEONROSA also provided the CS with second-hand HIV prescription medication bottles that were to be delivered to addresses in California, but which were intercepted by Federal Express due to the suspicious nature of the packages.*          *          *DELEONROSA, 48, of the Bronx, is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud, which carries a maximum potential sentence of 10 years in prison.  The maximum potential sentence in this case is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the judge.The charges contained in the Complaint are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara praised the outstanding work of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations.The case is being prosecuted by the Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Noah Solowiejczyk and Patrick Egan are in charge of the prosecution.[1]As the introductory phrase signifies, the entirety of the text of the Complaint and the description of the Complaint set forth herein constitute only allegations, and every fact described should be treated

In these advertisements, Simanjuntak claimed the insulin had been obtained from medical facilities, specifically nursing homes.On November 16, 2015, an undercover FDA agent contacted Simanjuntak at the telephone provided in the ads. Subsequent to this contact, the agent made five separate purchases of pre-filled insulin injection pens from the defendant. Cumulatively, between November 2015 and February 2016, FDA’s undercover agent purchased 17 boxes of pre-filled insulin pens, each box containing five pens, for which the agent paid a total of $1,870 to the defendant through Paypal. At no time during these transactions did Simanjuntak ask for, or require, the special agent to provide a valid prescription for the insulin. On two occasions, the agent received boxes of insulin from the defendant which still had affixed to them prescription labels for other patients.Simanjuntak is neither a licensed medical professional nor licensed to distribute prescription medication. All the transactions between the defendant and the special agent were mailed from Norfolk to Abingdon, Virginia.The investigation of the case was conducted by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations.

The Energy Wave device consists of a micro-current frequency generator with a digital readout, two stainless steel cylinders, two personal application plates with connectors and lead wire for the cylinders and plates.  Users were provided with an operating manual and a list of Auto Codes that set forth over 450 digital settings for the device, directed to treat specific conditions from abdominal pain, AIDS and diabetes to stroke, ulcer and worms.  The Auto Codes and Manuel advised users to connect the cylinders or plates to the machine, and touch them to the body for a recommended run time to treat each condition.David Perez admitted selling each device for approximately $1,200-$1,500, and receiving gross proceeds of approximately $271,000.  He also acknowledged that he intended to defraud and mislead the Food and Drug Administration by attempting to evade the agency’s oversight of medical claims made regarding the Energy Wave device by maintaining a separate website (rifecodes.com) to which he referred customers who needed to obtain the auto codes that allegedly were used to treat the various medical conditions.  Perez admitted that he knew or should have known a number of his customers were vulnerable because they had purchased the device in an attempt to cure cancer, and that they were marketing the device without the proper FDA approvals.“It’s unconscionable to sell useless medical devices to critically ill people who are hoping for a miracle,” said U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy. “This sentence reflects the serious nature of this crime, and our commitment to protecting those who are most vulnerable to being preyed upon by heartless predators.”“This investigation uncovered a serious public health threat and should serve as a warning to those who put consumers at risk for their own financial gain,” said Dave Shaw, special agent in charge for HSI San Diego. “HSI agents will continue to work with our law enforcement partners, both here and abroad, to investigate medical-related fraud over the Internet, especially when it involves an online marketing scam, such as this case in which unregulated medical devices were sold under false pretense.”“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service will continue to work with our partners in law enforcement to ensure that the U.S. Postal Service isn't used as a conduit for those criminals who seek to perpetrate medical quackery upon the American consumer,” said Robert Wemyss, Inspector in Charge of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service - Los Angeles Division.  “This type of crime takes advantage of the most vulnerable segment of the population to include the elderly and terminally ill.  The protection of our citizens remains the cornerstone of our mission.”“Consumers rely on the FDA to ensure that the medical products they use, including medical devices, actually treat the diseases or conditions they claim to.

Krueger, age 54, of Destrehan, Louisiana, of six federal felony offenses in connection with a scheme to sell illegal and mislabelled diet pills to victims throughout Louisiana. She was acquitted on one count. The jury’s verdicts followed a seven-day trial before U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles. The sentencing date has not yet been set.Specifically, Krueger was convicted of three counts of distributing a controlled substance and three counts of introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce. This conduct was part of a multi-state scheme to illegally distribute diet pills containing sibutramine, a Schedule IV controlled substance, which were falsely labeled and marketed as “all natural” dietary supplements. Sibutramine was the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Meridia, a prescription weight loss drug removed from the market in 2010 following studies that showed significantly increased risk of strokes and heart attacks. Since the removal of Meridia, no drug containing sibutramine has been approved for use in humans in the United States.The evidence at trial demonstrated that, between 2009 and 2014, Krueger engaged in a scheme to sell purportedly “all natural” dietary supplements under various names, such as “Slim Forte Slimming Capsules,” “Slim Forte Double Power Slimming Capsules,” “Slim-Vie Slimming Capsules,” and “Slim-Vie Double Power Slimming Capsules,” which she knew contained sibutramine, to customers throughout Louisiana. Even after she learned that the diet pills contained sibutramine and had potentially serious side effects, Krueger continued to distribute the diet pills and disseminate false and misleading information about the safety and efficacy of her products. Krueger made approximately $100,000 as a result of the scheme.In a related case, on July 29, 2015, John Wesley Hoag, age 52, of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, pled guilty before U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles to a Bill of Information charging him with conspiring with Krueger to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute sibutramine and introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce. During the guilty plea hearing, Hoag admitted to unlawfully importing the diet pills from manufacturers based in China and then distributing the diet pills to his distributors, including Krueger, and consumers.As a result of their respective roles, Krueger and Hoag face significant incarceration, fines, restitution, forfeiture of proceeds, and supervised release following imprisonment.U.S. Attorney Green stated:  “To sell diet pills containing illegal substances is bad enough. Selling diet pills containing illegal substancesandconcealing that fact from unsuspecting customers by mislabelling the pill containers is intolerable. The actions taken by the defendant in this matter – which appear driven purely by greed – will consistently result in our office’s full attention and action. I commend the excellent work by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations and our prosecutors who worked hand-in-hand to bring this case to its rightful conclusion.”“Consumers are put at serious risk when they are unknowingly exposed to undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients in products falsely labeled as natural dietary supplements,” said Robert J. West, Special Agent-in-Charge, Miami Field Office, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations. “Our office will continue to defend the public’s health by ensuring that dietary supplements are accurately labeled, and do not contain dangerous undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients.”This matter was handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Louisiana and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, with the assistance from other FDA components, the Louisiana State Police, the Slidell, Louisiana, Police Department, and the Drug Enforcement Administration. The matter was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Cam T. Le and Paul L. Pugliese.Health care professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse events or side effects related to the use of these products to the FDA. For more information regarding dietary supplements and to report adverse events, please visit the FDA’s website athttp://www.fda.gov/Food/DietarySupplements/.USAO - Louisiana, MiddleTopic:Prescription Drugs"

Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Barbara L. McQuade of the Eastern District of Michigan, Special Agent in Charge David P. Gelios of the FBI’s Detroit Field Office, Special Agent in Charge Lamont Pugh III of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) Chicago Region and Special Agent in Charge Jarod J. Koopman of Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Detroit Field Office made the announcement.Laran Lerner, 59, of Northville, Michigan, was sentenced today by U.S. District Judge Victoria A. Roberts of the Eastern District of Michigan, who also ordered Lerner to pay $2,789,409 in restitution.  Lerner pleaded guilty on Aug. 31, 2015, to one count of health care fraud and one count of structuring cash transactions to avoid bank reporting requirements.According to admissions made as part of his plea agreement, Lerner lured patients into his clinic with prescriptions for medically unnecessary controlled substances and then caused Medicare to be billed for a variety of unnecessary prescriptions, diagnostic tests and office visits to make it appear as though he was providing legitimate medical services.  Lerner admitted that in reality, the controlled medications were simply used to facilitate and conceal his scheme to steal millions of dollars from the Medicare program.  According to Lerner’s plea agreement, Medicare was billed $5,748,237 as a result of Lerner’s unnecessary prescriptions, office visits and diagnostic testing.Lerner also admitted that he structured cash deposits he received as a result of his scheme in $5,000 increments on consecutive days at various branch locations in the Detroit area in order to avoid the requirement that domestic banks file a currency transaction report with the Secretary of the Treasury for all currency transactions over $10,000.  According to his plea agreement, for example, in April 2013, Lerner deposited $70,000 in cash by making deposits of $5,000 on 14 different days.As part of the plea agreement, Lerner agreed to permanently surrender his Drug Enforcement Administration controlled substance registration and agreed to not to re-apply for this license in the future, and agreed that were he granted any application from any agency to prescribe or dispense controlled substances, it would be against the public interest.The FBI, HHS-OIG and IRS-CI investigated the case, which was brought as part of the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, supervised by the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Eastern District of Michigan.  Fraud Section Trial Attorney Elizabeth Young is prosecuting the case.Since its inception in March 2007, the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, now operating in nine cities across the country, has charged over 2,300 defendants who collectively have billed the Medicare program for over $7 billion.  In addition, the HHS Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, working in conjunction with the HHS-OIG, are taking steps to increase accountability and decrease the presence of fraudulent providers.To learn more about the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT), go towww.stopmedicarefraud.gov.16-346Criminal DivisionCriminal FraudUSAO - Michigan, EasternTopic:Healthcare Fraud"

Hayes. THOMAS BROOKE, 54, of Cooper City, Florida was the bookkeeper for Discount Pharmacy. At the sentencing hearing U.S. District Judge Richard A. Jones said BROOKE was a “central cog in this operation… Thousands of people continued their addiction because of what you were involved in.”The internet pharmacy distributed drugs to some 200 customers in Washington State between 2009 and 2012.  The pharmacy shipped hundreds of thousands of pills of hydrocodone, phentermine, alprazolam (Xanax) and codeine (Tylenol 4) to people across the country who did not have valid prescriptions for the narcotics. The conspiracy brought in more than $9 million in revenue from the sale of pills during the three year scheme. The pharmacy operated four internet sites through which they solicited customers and allowed customers in Washington State to order drugs. According to the indictment, the conspiracy would continue to refill prescriptions even if no valid prescription existed.  In some instances the conspirators simply looked for a physician in the same geographic area as the customer, with a similar sounding name and filled the prescription using the physician’s DEA number without the physician’s knowledge. The pharmacy charged as much as ten times the usual price for the medications.The conspirators laundered the proceeds of their sales through a brick-and-mortar pharmacy in Florida called Discount Pharmacy of Pines. BROOKE was a key figure in funneling the flow of money through the illegal business and to the conspirators. In June 2012, the DEA seized the conspiracy’s websites, computers, and drug inventory. Even after that seizure BROOKE set up different bank accounts and continued to structure deposits to avoid currency reporting requirements.Earlier this month Ali Lovins, 44, of Cooper City, Florida was sentenced to three years in prison.  Lovins is a registered nurse and was the office manager for Discount Pharmacy.  LOVINS pleaded guilty in April 2015 to four felony counts: conspiracy to distribute controlled substances by means of the internet; conspiracy to distribute controlled substances; conspiracy to launder money; and conspiracy to introduce misbranded drugs into interstate commerce.All but one of the defendants who were indicted in May 2014 has pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing:The originator of the scheme, JUAN GALLINAL, 48, of Pembroke Pines, Florida is a former police officer from Virginia.

        "content": "Food and Drug AdministrationOffice of Criminal InvestigationsU.S. Department of Justice Press ReleaseFor Immediate ReleaseMarch 7, 2016United States Department of JusticeEastern District of CaliforniaFRESNO, Calif. — Dr. Paul S. Singh, 55, of Tehachapi, was sentenced today to six months in prison, to be followed by one year of home detention by United States District Judge Anthony W. Ishii, for a scheme to defraud patients and their insurers by implanting and billing for unapproved intrauterine devices (IUDs), United States Attorney Benjamin B. Wagner announced. A restitution hearing is set for May 9, 2016, at 10:00 a.m.Singh, a medical doctor licensed to practice in California, had an office in Tehachapi. He provided obstetric and gynecological services to women, including providing forms of birth control. One form of birth control he provided were IUDs, which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates. The FDA has approved only one IUD that uses copper as its active ingredient, the ParaGard T-380A, which was sold only by its manufacturer and not available on third-party websites. Doctors who implant a non-FDA-approved copper IUD risk a patient’s safety. Such a device can result in an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, hysterectomy, and other serious complications.According to court documents, Singh bought unapproved IUDs on the Internet and implanted them in his patients. Rather than inform his patients or their insurers of using non-FDA approved IUDs, however, he fraudulently billed his patients and their insurers as if he had implanted FDA-approved IUDs, all without the permission or consent of his patients. Singh profited from the implanting unapproved IUDs by billing his patients and their insurers for the higher cost of approved IUDs, which was false and fraudulent.According to court documents, Singh was sent multiple bulletins and newsletters warning against the use of unapproved IUDs. He was also warned that products sold by online pharmacies were not identical to the ParaGard T-380A and had not been approved as safe and effective by the FDA. In spite of the warnings, Singh purchased unapproved IUDs from online retailers and implanted them in numerous patients without their consent, between April 2008 and June 2012.In August 2010, agents from the FDA confronted Singh about his history of implanting unapproved IUDs. During the meeting, Singh agreed to stop implanting them in his patients. In 2012, agents searched Singh’s office and learned that he had continued to implant unapproved IUDs in his patients.According to the plea agreement, many of Singh’s patients later complained to him and other doctors about medical complications they associated with Singh’s insertion of the IUD. In multiple instances, Singh responded to such complaints by re-inserting the IUD rather than removing it. Some patients ultimately had to switch doctors in order to have the IUD removed.U.S. Attorney Wagner stated: “Singh’s scheme risked the health of his patients and defrauded health care providers to benefit his bottom line. The investigation and prosecution of health care fraud is a priority for my office, particularly where that fraud endangers innocent patients.”“Medical doctors have a special responsibility to make the best choices for their patients. When they ignore that responsibility and use unapproved medical devices, they put patients’ safety and health at risk,” said Special Agent in Charge Lisa L. Malinowski, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Los Angeles Field Office. “Our office will continue its work to ensure that doctors and other healthcare professionals understand the consequences of using medical products that have not been approved by the FDA.”This case was the product of an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations. Assistant United States Attorneys Patrick R. Delahunty and Kirk E. Sherriff prosecuted the case.1:15-cr-212-AWIUSAO - California, EasternTopic:Healthcare Fraud"

Mizer, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.  “This case underlines the need for both consumers and the government to be vigilant in investigating what the American public is ingesting in the guise of weight loss or health enhancement supplements.”David Romeo, 46, of Washington Township, New Jersey, pleaded guilty to a four-count Information charging him with conspiracy to distribute three kilograms or more of meth precursors, money laundering, mail fraud and introduction of misbranded food into interstate commerce with intent to defraud or mislead.  As part of his plea agreement, Romeo has agreed to forfeit more than $1.2 million in money derived from his crimes.In pleading guilty, Romeo admitted that he was a principal of Global Nutrients, Stella Labs and Nutraceuticals, all of which were New Jersey-based entities engaged in the sale of dietary ingredients intended for use in dietary supplements sold to consumers.  Starting at least as early as 2003, Romeo directed his employees to use cheaper substitutes in place of the dietary ingredients that had actually been ordered by customers, most of whom were companies engaged in production of dietary supplements.  These substitutes were sent in many instances without the customer’s consent or knowledge.  As alleged in charging documents, Romeo and his associates referred to the substitution of cheaper ingredients as “SOP,” meaning “standard operating procedure.”Romeo admitted that, as part of the scheme, his businesses purported to sell a weight-loss ingredient called “hoodia.”  Stella Labs and Nutraceuticals represented to consumers that they were selling hoodia that had been sourced from a rare South African plant,Hoodia gordonii.  As alleged in the charging document, the substance being sold by Romeo’s business entities was manufactured at a facility in China.  As part of his plea agreement, Romeo agreed that the fraud scheme caused a loss of more than $7 million.Special agents of the Food & Drug Administration (FDA)’s Office of Criminal Investigations investigated the false supplement allegations of the case.“Manufacturing and selling misbranded dietary supplements puts American consumers at risk,” said Director George M.

Haloperidol, often marketed as Haldol, is an anti-psychotic medication used to treat certain mental/mood disorders and to treat uncontrolled movements or agitation.“To satisfy his addiction, the defendant stole pain medicine intended for veterans in hospice care and tried to hide his crime by replacing that medicine with anti-psychotic medicine that would not have eased their pain,” stated U.S. Attorney Richard S. Hartunian. “In committing this terrible crime, Baum betrayed his patients and their loved ones, the nursing profession, and the Department of Veterans Affairs.”“Mr. Baum abused his position as a nurse with the VA for his own personal gain at the expense of his patients,” stated Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey G. Hughes of the Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General, Northeast Field Office.  “The VAOIG will continue to work diligently with its law enforcement partners and U.S. Attorney’s Offices to apprehend those who victimize our nation’s veterans.”“FDA oversees the U.S. supply of medicines to ensure that they are safe and effective, and those who knowingly give the wrong medicines to patients put their health at risk,” said Spencer E. Morrison, Acting Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ New York Field Office.  “Our office will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who violate laws designed to protect the public health.”Baum’s tampering was discovered in late May 2014, when his supervisor noticed that he was slurring his speech and his pupils were pinpoint – signs of controlled substance abuse.   When federal agents inspected the locked container Baum was allowed to access, they found that three sets of oxycodone hydrochloride syringes had been tampered with.  In an interview, Baum admitted that he was addicted to painkillers; that he used oxycodone hydrochloride that was intended for veterans; and that he replaced the oxycodone hydrochloride in some syringes with Haldol.Senior U.S. District Judge Lawrence E. Kahn is scheduled to sentence Baum on June 22, 2016.  Tampering with a consumer product carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, a fine ofup to $250,000, and a term of supervised release of up to 3 years. Obtaining controlled substances by deception and subterfuge carries a maximum sentence of 4 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.  A defendant’s sentence is imposed by a judge based on a combination of factors including the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and relevant statutes.This case is being investigated by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General and the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth R.

Kronstadt.Judge Kronstadt sentenced Hbaiu to 24 months in prison for distribution of misbranded drugs, and structuring financial transactions with proceeds from criminal activity of more than $10,000.  Hbaiu was ordered to pay a $60,000 fine and to forfeit his interest in the house at 1806 Meadow Ridge Drive, Hummelstown, Pennsylvania, $20,000 cash and the contents of two bank accounts.  Hbaiu also agreed to the destruction of all seized sexual enhancement supplements.Kang was sentenced to one month in prison, five months home confinement and a $5,000 fine for distribution of misbranded drugs.Criminal charges were originally brought against Hbaiu in the Middle District of Pennsylvania in March 2013 before U.S. District Court Judge Sylvia H. Rambo and were later transferred to California.According to the United States Attorney’ Office, Hbaiu was involved in companies that sold drugs including “Mojo Nights,” “Libigrow” and “Blue Diamond” marketed as “all natural” versions of drugs such as Viagra. In fact, the drugs contained sildenafil citrate, the active ingredient in Viagra, and Tadalafil, the active ingredient in Cialis. The misbranded “performance enhancers” products were sold on internet web sites as well as physical locations, including one in York County.Kang headed companies in the Los Angeles area that supplied companies owned by Hbaiu with the misbranded dietary supplements and their ingredients.Also charged with criminal conspiracy were Ahed Hbaiu, age 32, of Etters in York County, Pennsylvania, Gil Conrad Dizon, age 28, of Los Angeles, and Christopher Mouzon, age 27, of Los Angeles.  In July 2015, Mouzon was sentenced by Judge Rambo in Harrisburg to six months in prison and four months home confinement for testifying falsely before the grand jury. Ahed Hbaiu reportedly left the country and Dizon is purportedly in the Philippines. Warrants have been issued for their arrest.Hbaiu was charged with conspiring to avoid the requirement that banks report cash transactions of $10,000 or more by “structuring” deposits made into various bank accounts.  Hbaiu made cash deposits of less than $10,000 in accounts of family members and associates and then transferred the money to accounts controlled by him. Some of the funds “structured” in this fashion were used to pay off the mortgage on a residence at 1806 Meadow Ridge Drive, Hummelstown, which was eventually titled to Alex Hbaiu.  Other structured funds were used to fund the business operations of Caliber Investments, 1 Stop Sunoco Gas Station and Eclipse Builders, all located in Etters, York County.“U.S. consumers rely on FDA oversight to ensure that dietary supplements contain only those ingredients that are disclosed on the label, and certainly to not contain the active ingredients in prescription drugs. When individuals manufacture and distribute supplements with undeclared and potentially dangerous ingredients, they place the health of consumers at serious risk,” said Glen A. McElravy, Acting Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Field Office.  “We will continue to direct our resources to bringing to justice those who threaten the public health.”“The structuring and concealment of monies derived from illegal activities is what enables criminal conduct  such as the distribution of misbranded drugs to flourish,” said Internal Revenue Service, Special Agent in Charge Akeia Conner. “The Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation is committed to enforcing the laws that insure individuals do not use our financial institutions to conceal the proceeds of their crimes.”This case was investigated by the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation, The Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, and the Drug Enforcement Administration.  The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy H.

Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Daniel G. Bogden of the District of Nevada and Director George M. Karavetsos of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA OCI) made the announcement today after the indictment was unsealed and the defendant made his initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Peggy A. Leen of the District of Nevada.Dmitriy V. Melnik, 29, was charged with one count of conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit goods and to introduce into interstate commerce misbranded devices; four counts of trafficking in counterfeit goods; and five counts of introducing misbranded devices into interstate commerce.According to the indictment, Melnik allegedly imported thousands of colored contact lenses from the People’s Republic of China and South Korea that he knew were counterfeit, unauthorized by the FDA for import to and sale in the United States, or both.  Many of these contact lenses bore counterfeit trademarks for Ciba Vision FreshLook COLORBLENDS, which are manufactured by Novartis International AG, and others had labels of brands of contact lenses produced and sold in Asia.As noted in the indictment, contact lenses—even decorative ones—are medical devices that must receive FDA authorization to enter the United States and be further distributed.  Melnik allegedly sold “authentic” contact lenses to customers without a prescription and without adequate directions for use or adequate warnings.  After purchasing the contact lenses, many customers complained directly to Melnik about the quality of the contact lenses and questioned Melnik about whether the contact lenses were genuine and FDA approved.  Some of the contact lenses that Melnik sold were tested and allegedly found to be contaminated with possibly hazardous bacteria.The charges and allegations contained in the indictment are merely accusations.  The defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty.Anyone with information about individuals committing intellectual property offenses can report those crimes to the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center by going tohttp://www.iprcenter.gov/referralor calling (866) IPR-2060.The prosecution is the result of an ongoing multiagency effort to combat counterfeit, illegally imported and unapproved contact lenses called Operation Double Vision.  The FDA OCI led the investigation, with significant support from the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations.  Senior Counsel Matthew A. Lamberti of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Crane M. Pomerantz of the District of Nevada are prosecuting the case.The indictment is related to the many efforts being undertaken by the department’s Task Force on Intellectual Property, which supports prosecution priorities, promotes innovation through heightened civil enforcement, enhances coordination among federal, state and local law enforcement partners and focuses on international enforcement efforts, including reinforcing relationships with key foreign partners and U.S. industry leaders.USAO - NevadaConsumer Protection"

Williams Sr. for the Northern District of Oklahoma.Following a 15-day trial before U.S. District Judge James H. Payne, a jury found Carpenter, 71, of Tulsa, guilty on 29 of the 41 counts alleged in a Superseding Indictment, and were unable to come to a unanimous decision on 3 counts of the Superseding Indictment. Carpenter was charged with five counts of inducing persons to travel in interstate commerce in an effort to defraud them of at least $5,000; 34 counts of using interstate wire communications to defraud patients; and two counts of using the United States mails in furtherance of a fraudulent scheme. Carpenter was indicted by a grand jury in August 2014, and a Superseding Indictment was filed on October 15, 2014.“The defendant preyed upon and lured her patients to her purported clinic in order to defraud them of money. Today’s conviction demonstrates the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s commitment to ensuring justice is served for victims and their family members,” said U.S. Attorney Williams. “Together with the FDA we are protecting individuals who were victimized by this fraudulent medical scheme. This should be a deterrent and warning to those who intend to defraud and take advantage of peoples’ situations.”According to documents filed in this case and evidence presented at trial:From November 2006 to December 2012, Carpenter, a physicist and not a medical doctor, orchestrated a scheme to obtain money from cancer patients by means of false and fraudulent representations. Carpenter made materially false claims to patients about her treatment method called “Light Induced Enhanced Selective Hyperthemia or “LIESH’, including that the treatments were 100% effective and there would be no negative side effects.In addition, Carpenter claimed to cure various kinds of cancers, when in fact, she would inject a patient’s tumor with a mixture consisting of saline solution and food coloring or walnut hull extract. She would then heat the injected area with a laser. Carpenter operated a clinic in Broken Arrow and Owasso, Oklahoma.At the time of sentencing, Carpenter faces up to 10 years in prison for inducing persons to travel in interstate commerce in an effort to defraud them of at least $5,000; and up to 20 years in prison on the remaining charges. Also as part of her sentence, a criminal forfeiture money judgment will be entered against the defendant in an amount of approximately $1,102,160 representing proceeds obtained as a result of her fraudulent scheme.United States Attorney Williams credited special agents of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-Office of Criminal Investigations and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kevin C.

Mizer, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.  “This criminal case demonstrates the Justice Department’s commitment to protecting consumers and patients, and making sure pharmaceutical drugs are safe and effective.”Allen, 60, of McCalla, Alabama, and Rogers, 48, of Hoover, Alabama, have signed plea agreements, in which both individuals have agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor violations of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) as charged in the Information.  Following today’s filing of the criminal charges; the U.S. District Court will schedule an arraignment, where the defendants will be formally advised of the charges against them.  Another hearing will then be set in which the defendants can enter their guilty pleas to the Court.As alleged in the Information, Meds IV compounded various drugs for human use, including an intravenous drug known as Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN).  TPN is liquid nutrition administered intravenously to patients who cannot or should not receive their nutrition through eating.  The information alleges that beginning in or around February 2011, Meds IV compounded its own amino acid solution, which it then mixed with other ingredients to form TPN.As charged in the information, amino acid used in compounding the TPN was adulterated in the following ways:  it consisted in whole or in part of a filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance, namelySerratia marcescens(S. marcescens) and it was prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have been contaminated with filth or rendered injurious to health.S. marcescensis gram-negative bacteria that can cause bloodstream infections if introduced into the bloodstream through contaminated medications.  These infections can cause serious medical complications, including death, becauseS. marcescensis resistant to many antibiotics.“Meds IV was in the business of compounding drugs and IV nutrition that was supposed to help patients heal,” said U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance for the Northern District of Alabama.  “Instead, because of unsanitary procedures in the mixing of liquid nutrition, contaminated IV fluid was sent to Birmingham area hospitals and a number of patients developed serious bloodstream infections.  I thank the FDA and its Office of Criminal Investigations for their diligence in helping us prosecute those responsible for the failings at Meds IV which contributed to significant harm.”According to the charging document, the amino acid was prepared by Meds IV outside a laminar airflow workbench and was kept unrefrigerated, in a room that was not sterile, in a large pot sitting on the floor, sometimes overnight, before it was sterilized and used.As alleged in the information, between March 5 and 15, 2011, nine patients at various Birmingham-area hospitals who developed bloodstream infections caused byS. marcescensdied, and several other hospital patients developedS. marcescensbloodstream infections but survived.  According to the charges, all of these patients had been given TPN that was compounded and distributed by Meds IV.  As alleged in the information, while a number of the patients who died had underlying conditions which may have contributed to their deaths, medical records of some patients suggest that theS. marcescensbloodstream infections were also a significant factor.According to the information, Meds IV was notified on March 14, 2011, by a hospital in the Birmingham area, that four patients receiving TPN had tested positive forS. marcescens.  The information alleges that the TPN was compounded and distributed by Meds IV and that this notification was the first time Meds IV was informed of a link between its TPN and patients testing positive forS. marcescens.  The information alleges that on or around March 16, 2011, Meds IV began notifying some customers that compounding of TPN was suspended until further notice.As noted in the information, during an inspection at Meds IV starting on March 22, 2011, investigators from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) foundS. marcescensthat was indistinguishable to the outbreak strain on a tap-water faucet, in an open container of amino acid powder and on the surface of mixing equipment that had been used to make TPN.  According to the charging document, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CDC investigators linked theS. marcescensto TPN that had been compounded by Meds IV.“Americans expect and deserve drugs that are safe, effective, and that meet appropriate standards for quality, yet Meds IV contaminated and distributed drug products that resulted in serious harm to patients,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Stephen Ostroff, MD.  “Such conduct cannot be tolerated, and the FDA will continue to work with the Department of Justice to pursue aggressive enforcement actions against those who place American patients at risk.”As alleged in the Information, Allen supervised all compounding at Meds IV, was specifically responsible for reviewing and approving TPN formulations, and was also responsible for filling the individual prescriptions Meds IV received for patient-specific TPN products.  The information alleges that Rogers was ultimately responsible for overseeing all of the day-to-day operations of Meds IV.  Both defendants have agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts, representing the two lots of amino acid which were determined to be adulterated in violation of the FDCA.  For each count, the defendants face a statutory maximum sentence of up to one year in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, or both, and a term of supervised release after any imprisonment for up to one year.The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Heide L. Herrmann of the Justice Department’s Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorney Henry Cornelius of the Northern District of Alabama.  They were assisted by Associate Chief Counsel Shannon M. Singleton of the Food and Drug Division, Office of General Counsel, Department of Health and Human Services.  The case was investigated by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations.A criminal Information is merely an allegation and every defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.16-104Civil DivisionConsumer Protection"

The defendants would take in these orders over the internet primarily from individuals and entities operating internet pharmacy websites and other types of illicit pharmacy operations who, in turn, were undertaking to sell these drugs to their retail customers without valid prescriptions from licensed medical professionals. The defendants would take in orders for bulk drug shipments directly to these pharmacy operations and for drop shipments directly to the customers of these pharmacy operations. A substantial portion of the orders taken in by the defendant were for shipment to businesses and individuals located in the United States.The defendants would undertake to fill these drug orders to the United States businesses and residents by procuring brand name and generic drugs that they knew to be unapproved for the United States market by the FDA from suppliers whose drug manufacturing facilities were not approved by the FDA and whose packaging and patient literature for their drugs was also not approved by the FDA.  As part of the conspiracy, the defendants, using a series of email addresses, would forward the drug orders to a network of drug suppliers in Pakistan, India, the United Kingdom, and China.  Some would obtain stockpiles of the drugs being ordered and, from these stockpiles or from the suppliers directly, would cause the orders to be filled by shipments through the international mail to or on behalf of their customers.  With respect to some of the drug shipments ultimately intended for United States recipients, the defendants would alternatively employ a network of individuals located in the United States to receive the imported drugs and re-ship them to the ultimate customers within the United States once the drugs had been safely imported.Qadir would often cause the drugs being shipped to the United States to evade detection by United States customs and foreign customs authorities by having those drugs concealed, in loose format, in plastic vitamin bottles and plastic water bottles.  They would also cause the drug shipments to evade customs detection by causing the shipments to be accompanied by customs declarations that inaccurately or misleadingly described the contents of the shipments or without customs declarations altogether. The drugs would often be shipped in mail parcels without packaging, without labels, and without patient safety leaflets or other written instructions and information.In order to secure payment for the drug shipments, the defendants and their co-conspirators would have their United States customers send money transfers, by way of Western Union and similar money transferring services, to themselves in their own names or in the names of various individuals located in Pakistan or, alternatively, would have the customers send bank wire transfers to various bank accounts in the names of associated businesses or their own names at financial institutions located and based in the United Arab Emirates and elsewhere.  The defendants, on occasion, would also have their domestic operatives transfer money to one another in order to satisfy obligations that the defendants and their co-conspirators had to them.The illegal drugs imported by the defendants include counterfeit or unapproved versions of: Viagra, Lorazepam, Alprazolam, Diazepam, Zolpidem, and Phentermine.\"This case should be a reminder to everyone that buying counterfeit prescription drugs on line from overseas pharmacies is playing with fire,\" said U.S. Attorney John Walsh.   \"An online buyer of such drugs has no idea what drug or substance they are actually receiving.   The U.S. Attorney's Office,  Homeland Security Investigations and FDA will work tirelessly -- as we did in this case -- to locate, charge and apprehend counterfeit drug traffickers in whatever corner of the world they may hide.\"“There’s a misperception that counterfeiting is a victimless crime, but unfortunately it is not – counterfeit pharmaceuticals can and have led to serious injuries and death,” said David A. Thompson, special agent in charge of HSI Denver. “For that reason, and because counterfeiting often funds illegal activity, we take cases like Qadir’s very seriously and work tirelessly with our partners to investigate these crimes and bring those who commit them to justice.”“The FDA-regulated supply chain for medicines helps protect consumers from prescription drugs that could be harmful or unsafe for them to use. When criminals provide unapproved and counterfeit prescription drugs online, they place the public’s health at risk,” said Catherine A Hermsen, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Kansas City Field Office. “We will continue to be vigilant in our efforts to bring such criminals to justice.”“This arrest is evidence that no matter where you are, be it in the United States or abroad, if you use the U.S. Mail to endanger the American public, we will find you,” said Craig Goldberg, Inspector-in-Charge of the Denver Division of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.  “We will continue to use our resources to protect the American public and ensure the integrity of the U.S. Mail.  This case is another great example of federal law enforcement agencies partnering together to keep America safe.”Junaid Qadir faces the following charges:  Introduction and Delivery for Introduction of Unapproved New Drugs into Interstate Commerce, Introduction and Delivery for Introduction of Misbranded Drugs into Interstate Commerce, Sale of Counterfeit Drugs, Importation of Schedule IV Controlled Substances, Distribution of Scheduled IV Controlled Substances, Importation of Merchandise Contrary to Law, Conspiracy to Defraud the U.S. and Commit Offenses Against the U.S., Conspiracy to Import Schedule IV Controlled Substances and Conspiracy to Distribute and Possess with Intent to Distribute Schedule IV Controlled Substances.  Penalties for these offenses range from not more than 3 years in federal prison per count, to not more than 20 years in federal prison per count.  Each count also carries a penalty of up to a $250,000 fine.HSI further stated that the trafficking of counterfeit goods is the second largest illicit trade activity, valued at roughly $250 billion. In fiscal year 2014, HSI, working through its National Intellectual Property Rights Center, seized more than 23,000 counterfeit items with an MSRP of $1.2 billion. Members of a public who would like to report information about suspected counterfeiters are encouraged to call ICE’s toll-free Tip Line at 1-866-DHS-2-ICE or by completing this online tip form.This case was investigated by HSI, FDA OCI, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.Qadir is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Kenneth M. Harmon.The charges contained in the indictment are allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.USAO - ColoradoDrug TraffickingHealthcare Fraud"

Hillman to three years of probation, the first six months of which is to be served in home detention.  In Novebmer 2015, Dacri pleaded guilty to one count of acquiring and obtaining Oxycodone by deception.“Healthcare professionals stealing opioids to feed an addiction pose a compound threat to patients,” said United States Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz.  “Not only are they denying patients of necessary pain management, but they are often ‘caring’ for patients while under the influence of narcotics.”From February to June 2014, Dacri was a nurse at a Worcester nursing care facility.  During that period, she stole numerous Oxycodone tablets prescribed to three patients, and surreptitiously substituted other, similar-looking tablets, specifically Loratadine (antihistamine) tablets and Mirtazapine (antidepressant) tablets, in place of the Oxycodone tablets.This case is being prosecuted as part of the federal response to the growing opioid epidemic in Massachusetts. National health data reveals that two-thirds of heroin addicts start their opioid addition with the unlawful use of prescription painkillers such as oxycodone.United States Attorney Carmen M.

Dimitrouleas to 16 months in prison, to be followed by one year of supervised release, for trafficking in counterfeit cigarettes.Wilfredo A. Ferrer, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, Robert J. West, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Miami Field Office, and U.S. Food & Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA/OCI), made the announcement.Jayaseelan previously pled guilty to selling and dispensing and causing the sale and dispensing of a counterfeit tobacco product, cigarettes, the labeling of which bore the trade name of Newport cigarettes, a tobacco product listed with the FDA under Title 21, United States Code, Section 387(e)(i)(1), in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Sections 331(qq)(3) and 333(a)(2), and Title 18, United States Code, Section 2; and trafficking in 53,740 cartons of cigarettes, while knowingly using a counterfeit mark on and in connection with such cigarettes, the use of which was likely to cause confusion, cause mistake, and deceive. The counterfeit marks were false marks identical to and substantially indistinguishable from the marks of the legitimate manufacturer of Newport brand cigarettes, which were in use by and registered to the manufacturer on the principal register of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 2320(a) and 2.According to the court record, including a jointly filed factual statement and statements made at the sentencing hearing, the investigation began in January 28, 2013, when a U.S. Food & Drug Administration/Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA/OCI) undercover agent met and discussed the sale of counterfeit Marlboro brand cigarettes with a middle-man. Thereafter, negotiating by email, a deal to sell and ship counterfeit Marlboro Reds, for a total cost of $377,300.00 was reached. To pursue the deal, agents made an initial wire transfer of funds to an account in Dubai, United Arab Emirates for the purchase of the counterfeit cigarettes.In August 2013, undercover agents met with defendant Jayaseelan, who travelled to Miami, FL to discuss the pending sale.  During the recorded meeting, Jayaseelan told the agents that he and his father, Jayaseelan were in the cigarette and alcohol business and claimed they owned their own tobacco manufacturing plant which could manufacture any tobacco brand.  Jayaseelan later sent an email offering to provide counterfeit Newport cigarettes within four to five weeks. Subsequently, at Jayaseelan’s request, two cartons of Newport cigarettes to be used as samples for the manufacturing of the counterfeits were provided to an address in India.In January 2014, Jayaseelan emailed that they would send 1,030 master cases of Newport cigarettes for a total wholesale price of $450,625. In May 2014 the shipment was seized by Customs and Border Protection Officers at Port Everglades, in coordination with the FDA/OCI and agents of the Department of Homeland Security (HSI). The counterfeit cigarettes had an estimated street value in the United States exceeding $5.6 million. Although the product was seized, the agents were able to conceal from the suppliers that they were law enforcement officers, and Jayaseelan travelled to the United States in August 2015, only to be arrested for his role in the criminal conduct.Counterfeit cigarettes, which are sold without proper registration and testing may pose a greater health risk than consumers recognize, due to the presence of contaminants either not found in products originating from the lawful manufacturers, or which are present in greater concentrations.Mr. Ferrer commended the investigative efforts of the FDA/OCI, Miami Field Office, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Port Everglades Office, ICE-HSI, Fort Lauderdale Office, and Broward Sheriff’s Office (BSO) for their assistance in the development of the case. This matter is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Watts-FitzGerald.Related court documents and information may be found on the website of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida atwww.flsd.uscourts.govor onhttp://pacer.flsd.uscourts.gov"
